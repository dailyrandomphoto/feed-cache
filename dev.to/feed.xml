      <title>Don't fear the command line :  Tar. What  is that?</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/deniselemonaki/don-t-fear-the-command-line-tar-what-is-that-d0e</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first heard of the &lt;code&gt;tar&lt;/code&gt; command I was confused and could not quite understand it's use. How is that command useful in the day-to-day use of Linux and how often does it actually get used? Not to mention that it has all these flags to go alongside it, it was very confusing to me at first sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-tar" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Tar?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;tar&lt;/code&gt; command stands for &lt;code&gt;tape archive&lt;/code&gt; and is used to group many files and directories into a single compressed archive. That way it can be moved from disc to disc, from machine to machine and sent over to someone else. The same command is also used to extract that archive that we create.&lt;br&gt;
It is essentially a zip file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/gh6gFVh35jyzNvHegl/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/gh6gFVh35jyzNvHegl/giphy.gif" alt="expand on that"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general syntax looks something along these lines:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;tar [flags] [archive-file] [file or directory to be archived]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-absolute-basics-to-get-started" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The absolute basics to get started
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put a folder into an archive (let's say in this case a folder named &lt;code&gt;folder&lt;/code&gt;-very creative naming) we would do the following:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;tar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-cvf&lt;/span&gt; archive.tar folder
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Above we created a single file(&lt;code&gt;archive.tar&lt;/code&gt;) that contains the folder. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;-c&lt;/code&gt; flag stands for &lt;code&gt;create&lt;/code&gt; and is used to create the tar file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; flag stands for &lt;code&gt;verbose&lt;/code&gt; and displays the progress of the action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; flag creates archive with given filename(&lt;code&gt;archive.tar&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While experimenting with the flags and changing their order I noticed that when I used &lt;code&gt;-cfv&lt;/code&gt; I got an error whereas when I used &lt;code&gt;-cvf&lt;/code&gt; like I showed in the example, it worked. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/fUqfaPVjiAQcfticZH/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/fUqfaPVjiAQcfticZH/giphy.gif" alt="how?"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guessed that  the order must be very important.After some research with my best friend lately(stackoverflow)  I learnt that when the flags are used together , the dash in front of them is optional. However, if we use the dash we must use the flags in the accurate order otherwise it won't work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/XGnH2RGHoCqumsAXpo/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/XGnH2RGHoCqumsAXpo/giphy.gif" alt="pat"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we created our archive and now we want to extract it. &lt;br&gt;
To extract our &lt;code&gt;archive.tar&lt;/code&gt; file we switch the &lt;code&gt;-c&lt;/code&gt; flag which is used to &lt;code&gt;create&lt;/code&gt; and we instead use the &lt;code&gt;-x&lt;/code&gt; flag which stands for &lt;code&gt;extract&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;tar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-xvf&lt;/span&gt; archive.tar
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The archive we created earlier was not compressed, and most times we want to compress it as it it significantly smaller in size as it gets run through gzip .&lt;br&gt;
To create an archive that is compressed we use the &lt;code&gt;-z&lt;/code&gt; flag which stands for &lt;code&gt;compress the tar file using gzip&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;tar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-czvf&lt;/span&gt; archive.tar.gz folder
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Again,If using the &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; in front of the flags it's important to remember the right order.&lt;br&gt;
If we type &lt;code&gt;ls -ls&lt;/code&gt; to see a &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; with of the files we have and information about, including their size( that's what the &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; stands for) then we'll notice than &lt;code&gt;archive.tar.gz&lt;/code&gt; is significantly smaller in size than &lt;code&gt;archive.tar&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To extract it we then use:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;tar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-xzvf&lt;/span&gt; archive.tar.gz
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We could use the &lt;code&gt;-C&lt;/code&gt; flag and a destination folder for where we want the files to go. That folder must exist already before this action.If we leave that flag of it'll extract the archive where ever we are .&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;tar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-xzvf&lt;/span&gt; archive.tar.gz &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-C&lt;/span&gt; destination-folder
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These are the absolute basics to get started with &lt;code&gt;tar&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Thanks for reading 😃&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>We should be teaching our kids how to code. Or should we?</title>
      <author>darrendube</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 16 Feb 2021 13:21:09 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/darrendube/we-should-be-teaching-our-kids-how-to-code-or-should-we-3ml4</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/darrendube/we-should-be-teaching-our-kids-how-to-code-or-should-we-3ml4</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The debate over whether children should be taught to code in school has been going on for quite a while now. One side says that coding is the new literacy, and everyone should know how to. The other side rejects this claim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, though the idea that coding will be beneficial to children is still under debate, I do not envisage it ever being at the same level as indispensable skills like reading or writing. Coding is not a skill needed by everyone. An actuary may benefit from knowing how to code, but a nurse wouldn't. Coding is beneficial only if it solves a problem. People should not learn how to code just because. Jeff Atwood said about this argument in &lt;a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/please-dont-learn-to-code/"&gt;an article of his&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It assumes that coding is the goal. Software developers tend to be software addicts who think their job is to write code. But it's not. Their job is to solve problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people say coding could make our kids get better at problem-solving. But so could chess. And maths. And sports. My point is that there are many other skills that would be beneficial to kids. Coding is a practical subject, and if schools started teaching it, they might probably take away all the practicalness from it and teach it just like every other subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could instead introduce kids to code and get them to know how it looks like. Then it would be their choice to continue, either in a club or in their own time on platforms such as Codecademy and SoloLearn. Coding should not be forced on children in any way, as by doing so, we risk sucking the creativity out of it, the very skill we are trying to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think about teaching kids to code? Leave a comment below!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Search and debug gems with `bundle open`</title>
      <author>matt swanson</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 16 Feb 2021 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/swanson/search-and-debug-gems-with-bundle-open-3fbg</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/swanson/search-and-debug-gems-with-bundle-open-3fbg</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever get frustrated trying to search through code on GitHub? Or wish you could put a breakpoint in a gem so you could figure out what it was doing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t mess around with cloning the gem repo or monkey patching code in your own app. Use &lt;code&gt;bundle open&lt;/code&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--X4c_fVFO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://boringrails.com/images/bundle-open.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--X4c_fVFO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://boringrails.com/images/bundle-open.gif" alt="Example of bundle open command"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#usage" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Usage
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your shell, run the command: &lt;code&gt;bundle open GEM_NAME&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;bundler&lt;/code&gt; will open the source code for the exact version of the gem you’ve got installed in your editor. You can search the code inside your editor and even add breakpoints or make code changes locally to test out things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#options" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Options
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;bundle open&lt;/code&gt; command launches the editor that you’ve set via the &lt;code&gt;EDITOR&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;BUNDLER_EDITOR&lt;/code&gt; environment variables. You can set this to be &lt;code&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;emacs&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;VS Code&lt;/code&gt;, or whatever tool you like to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve made changes to the local gems for debugging or experimental purposes, you can use the &lt;code&gt;bundle pristine&lt;/code&gt; command to restore your gems to their “original” state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#additional-resources" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Additional Resources
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bundler Docs: &lt;a href="https://bundler.io/bundle_open.html"&gt;bundle open&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bundler Docs: &lt;a href="https://bundler.io/v2.2/man/bundle-pristine.1.html"&gt;bundle pristine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How To Stay Motivated While Learning to Code</title>
      <author>Cole Caccamise</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 16 Feb 2021 05:44:49 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/colecaccamise/how-to-stay-motivated-while-learning-to-code-1oi5</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/colecaccamise/how-to-stay-motivated-while-learning-to-code-1oi5</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past 2 years, I have been attempting to teach myself to code. I have faced many hurdles, however, a lack of drive has been the largest roadblock in my journey. Actually learning the content isn’t the hard part, it’s having the motivation to continue. Now, this isn’t to say that it’s easy to learn code, because it’s not, it just takes serious dedication. Having the drive to learn is going to make the process much easier. For every trip-up you encounter, it’ll be easier to get back up when you truly want to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tips are greatly aimed at beginners who are overwhelmed with the long road ahead but is not exclusive to them. Everything I’m about to mention is applicable to anyone, at any level. The truth is that you will NEVER stop learning, and will always need something to push you forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you read onward, I want you to ask yourself: Do I truly have a passion for code? Do I aspire to build things and solve problems? That is what coding, at its core, really is. If your answer to either of those questions was no, then coding may not be for you. Now, I’m not saying that having a passion for coding means you will never feel discouraged or tired. Coding is my biggest passion, yet to this day I still struggle staying on track at times. If you lack devotion and love for coding, you’re going to have an awful time. Learning is already hard enough, and without the motivation to do so, it’s going to be difficult to overcome the countless hurdles you’ll encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tip-1-have-an-end-goal-in-mind" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tip #1 — Have An End Goal In Mind
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My biggest piece of advice is to have something that you want to work towards and accomplish in the long-term. This doesn’t be anything crazy, just something that you’re excited about. To give you an idea, I’ll share mine. I want to create content that inspires people and build a SaaS/Freelancing business that will allow me to work for myself in the next 5 years. Now, as I said, your dream doesn’t have to be as big as mine. You may just want to have the security of a typical 9–5 job, and that’s completely okay. Not everyone is fit for an entrepreneurial lifestyle and all of the things that come along with it. You might not even want to make a career out of code at all, and just learn it as a hobby. No matter what your end goal is, just make sure that it is &lt;strong&gt;yours&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tip-2%E2%80%8A%E2%80%8Astay-organized-and-consistent" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tip #2 — Stay Organized And Consistent
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try to turn coding into a habit. Set aside a time as frequently as possible that fits into your schedule. Whether this is 30 minutes or 3 hours, it doesn't matter. Obviously, the more serious you are about learning and the faster you want to get through it, the more time you’ll have to spend. Fun fact: it only takes around 21 straight days of doing something for it to become a habit. Once coding becomes as routine as brushing your teeth, it’ll be so much easier to sit down and get to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend making a list of short-term goals for yourself for each week and put them into a calendar. This will divide up the content that you need to focus on and make it less overwhelming. I have really enjoyed using the app &lt;a href="//HTTP://notion.so"&gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt; to manage my time, but it did take quite a bit for me to tailor it to my liking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tip-3-have-a-good-environment" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tip #3 — Have A Good Environment
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot stress enough the importance of having a good workspace. Having an area that you can sit down (or stand) in peace will increase your focus immensely, and in turn, help you to become more motivated. Make sure you are in a quiet space away from any possible distractions. If you can, try and leave your phone in a separate room to prevent you from being distracted. Turn on some non-wordy music like lofi beats that you can relax to. If your budget allows it, having a quality chair is one of the best investments you can make. After all, it is what you will be spending most of your time working in (unless, you’re using a standing desk, of course). I personally use the Autonomous ErgoChair 2, which I absolutely love. It’s pretty comfortable and for 369 USD, it’s not a bad deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tip-4-prevent-burnout-and-take-a-break" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tip #4 — Prevent Burnout And Take A Break
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s going to take an immense amount of effort to learn to code, but it's crucial that you still rest your mind. It’s not healthy to put all of your energy into this. Cut yourself some slack, and take a break every so often. During every coding session, make sure to take a break and go grab a glass of water, go for a quick walk, or just anything to clear your mind. It’s good practice to take a break every couple of hours or so. Make it long enough where you will feel refreshed upon returning but no too long that you have lost your motivation to continue. 10–15 minutes is a good rule of thumb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tip-5-be-disciplined" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tip #5 — Be Disciplined
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I strongly believe that the previous tips will help you to stay motivated, there will still be times you feel discouraged. When you simply cannot find the drive to continue, it's up to your self-discipline to keep you going. The definition of discipline is the practice of training [yourself] to obey rules or a code of behavior, using punishment to correct disobedience. You need to make yourself code, even when you don’t feel like it. Circling back to my previous tip of having an end goal, recognizing that by continuing to learn, you are closer to your dream, you will have the strength to push yourself forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#closing-remarks" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Closing Remarks
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have not had an extremely successful past with learning to code. It took me close to a year and a half to find the motivation to take this seriously. I realized just a few short months ago that I do truly have a passion for this field. Learning to code has been one of the most enjoyable experiences of my life and I am extremely grateful to have the drive to push myself harder every day. I hope that by following the tips I have outlined in this article, you can also find the motivation to continue on your journey. I wish you the best of luck and hope to see you again soon ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank you for reading! While you’re here, let me introduce myself:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My name is Cole Caccamise and I’m a Content Creator, Developer, and Tech Enthusiast.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Along with writing about programming here, I share similar content on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRU9gfeM85WxFqxJFrDsCFQ"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="//HTTP://instagram.com/cole.caccamise"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="//HTTP://twitter.com/colecaccamise"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#declare"&gt;Declaring/Creating Date&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#dateconvert"&gt;Date Convertions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Most of the time when we are saving data to our databases, one of the most types we always use is date types. So as a developer we should atleast know how we can manipulate dates. So in this articles I am showing how you can manipulate dates in JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to setup Supabase Auth with Sapper SSR</title>
      <author>Jakob Bouchard</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 16 Feb 2021 01:19:45 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/jakobbouchard/how-to-setup-supabase-auth-with-sapper-ssr-13od</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/jakobbouchard/how-to-setup-supabase-auth-with-sapper-ssr-13od</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a developer who quite recently discovered &lt;a href="https://svelte.dev"&gt;Svelte&lt;/a&gt; (and now likes it a bunch), I decided to make my portfolio and a new (secret as of now) side-project using &lt;a href="https://sapper.svelte.dev"&gt;Sapper&lt;/a&gt;, its little framework. Both of these project require authentication and I thought to myself, why not do it all with server-side instead of client-side like many tutorials show with &lt;a href="https://firebase.google.com"&gt;Firebase&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I will be using &lt;a href="https://supabase.io"&gt;Supabase&lt;/a&gt; instead, as I prefer supporting open-source software, and honestly, it's also super nice and easy to work with! As a matter of fact, &lt;a href="https://dev.to/jakobbouchard/setting-up-umami-with-vercel-and-supabase-3a73"&gt;my previous post&lt;/a&gt; featured it as the database for Umami analytics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll be honest here, I hit quite a few roadblocks during the process, but in the end, all was well and I actually learned a bunch of new stuff!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be including explanations to both the functions and reasons why I decided to do it in a certain way in collapsibles as I am not sure everyone will need them, and they also might get quite long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project's code is also &lt;a href="https://github.com/jakobbouchard/sapper-supabase-auth"&gt;available here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-1-setting-up-sapper" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 1: Setting up Sapper
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll be basing ourselves off the Sapper template, as it will make our job easier. To setup Sapper, just run these commands:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx degit &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"sveltejs/sapper-template#rollup"&lt;/span&gt; sapper-supabase-auth
npm i
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now that the required packages are installed, let's install the other packages we'll need, since there's quite a few of them. We can also uninstall &lt;code&gt;polka&lt;/code&gt;, since we'll replace it with &lt;code&gt;express&lt;/code&gt;. I'll explain why later in the tutorial.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm r polka
npm i express@latest cookie-parser body-parser @supabase/supabase-js
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now open &lt;code&gt;server.js&lt;/code&gt;, where we'll change every mention of &lt;code&gt;polka&lt;/code&gt; by &lt;code&gt;express&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// server.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sirv&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;sirv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;compression&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;compression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sapper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@sapper/server&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PORT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;NODE_ENV&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// AND HERE&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;compression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;threshold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sirv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dev&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;middleware&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;PORT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can now run &lt;code&gt;npm run dev&lt;/code&gt; and open &lt;code&gt;localhost:3000&lt;/code&gt; in your browser. You should be greeted by this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--te0aaDzn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/u8f5kkpik8usf5dy9q2r.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--te0aaDzn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/u8f5kkpik8usf5dy9q2r.png" alt="Sapper template homepage"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  Explanation
  &lt;br&gt;
There isn't much explanation required here, however, we did change &lt;code&gt;polka&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;express&lt;/code&gt; for a reason. &lt;code&gt;express&lt;/code&gt;' response isn't the same and since we use cookies, I preferred using it since it has an included &lt;code&gt;res.cookie()&lt;/code&gt; function, that &lt;code&gt;polka&lt;/code&gt; doesn't have. If you decide to not swap them, you will either need to include a new package to create cookies or create your own cookie file.&lt;br&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-2-creating-the-dashboard-page-and-the-authentication-page" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 2: Creating the dashboard page and the authentication page
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we confirmed that Sapper still works, we can go ahead and create the files we'll be needing for this tutorial. First off, we can go ahead and delete the &lt;code&gt;blog&lt;/code&gt; folder as well as rename the &lt;code&gt;about.svelte&lt;/code&gt; file to &lt;code&gt;dashboard.svelte&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;index.svelte&lt;/code&gt; file will act as a authentication page for simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;components/Nav.svelte&lt;/code&gt;, we can replace the existing links with our new links:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;nav&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;aria-current=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"{segment === undefined ? 'page' : undefined}"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;home&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;aria-current=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"{segment === 'dashboard' ? 'page' : undefined}"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"dashboard"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;dashboard&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/nav&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#authentication-and-dashboard-layout" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Authentication and dashboard layout
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the authentication page, we will simply create 2 forms: one for the sign in and another for the sign up.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- index.svelte --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:last-child&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin-bottom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;4em&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.5em&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2.8em&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;700&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;text-align&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;text-transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;uppercase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;"checkbox"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin-bottom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.25em&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.5em&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.5em&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#999&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;solid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin-top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1em&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.5em&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;rgb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;62&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;medium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.1s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ease-in-out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:hover&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/svelte:head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Sign in&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"password"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"password"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;placeholder=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Password"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;for=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"remember"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"remember"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"checkbox"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            Remember me
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"submit"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Sign up&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As for the dashboard, we will simply have a title and a sign out button.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- index.svelte --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;context=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"module"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.5em&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2.8em&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;700&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;text-align&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;text-transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;uppercase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin-top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1em&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.5em&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.25em&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;rgb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;62&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;solid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rgba&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;62&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0.1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;rgb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;62&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;medium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.1s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ease-in-out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:hover&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rgba&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;62&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0.2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;cursor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;pointer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Our very cool dashboard&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Sign out&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our pages should now look like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6rsKYuGl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/9ra3oxaj9myd6uwfduki.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6rsKYuGl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/9ra3oxaj9myd6uwfduki.png" alt="Authentication page"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NLd3mMeO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/9wj30nok85ngyy47312h.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NLd3mMeO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/9wj30nok85ngyy47312h.png" alt="Dashboard"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-3-securing-the-dashboard" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 3: Securing the dashboard
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To secure the dashboard, we will be using Sapper's session store, which we can access with the Sapper middleware in the &lt;code&gt;server.js&lt;/code&gt; file. For now, we'll only return false, but later we will populate it with the user's access token.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// server.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;compression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;threshold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sirv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dev&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;middleware&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;userToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;PORT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;dashboard.svelte&lt;/code&gt;, we can make use of Sapper's &lt;code&gt;preload&lt;/code&gt; function, which we can access in the &lt;code&gt;module&lt;/code&gt; context. We can simply check if the userToken exists in the session, and if it doesn't, we redirect to the authentication page.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- dashboard.svelte --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;context=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"module"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;preload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;userToken&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;userToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;redirect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;302&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;userToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you now try to access the dashboard page, either by the navbar or by directly entering the link, it should redirect you to the authentication page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  Explanation
  &lt;br&gt;
Sapper has an included session/store (&lt;a href="https://svelte.dev/tutorial/writable-stores"&gt;learn more about stores&lt;/a&gt;) that is easily accessible via the middleware in the server. For now, we simply make it an object with a &lt;code&gt;userToken&lt;/code&gt; property that we set to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;. In our dashboard, we use Sapper's included &lt;a href="https://sapper.svelte.dev/docs#Preloading"&gt;&lt;code&gt;preload&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; function, where we check the session's &lt;code&gt;userToken&lt;/code&gt;. If it doesn't exist/is equal to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;, we redirect the user to the authentication page. If it does exist, we return the token.&lt;br&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-4-creating-the-authentication-functions" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 4: Creating the authentication functions
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#supabase-setup" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Supabase setup
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Head over to &lt;a href="https://app.supabase.io"&gt;Supabase&lt;/a&gt; to create your project. Once your project is created, go in the settings, then in in the API section, where you'll be able to find your project URL and key:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sj_1bBK1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/6ov61d4rvkttce4djyy6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sj_1bBK1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/6ov61d4rvkttce4djyy6.png" alt="Supabase API Settings"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before creating our functions, we should start by creating our Supabase client. In the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; folder, we will create a simple file called &lt;code&gt;supabase.js&lt;/code&gt; that we will import every time we need to use Supabase. I highly suggest putting the Supabase URL and anonymous key in environment variables, for better security.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// supabase.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createClient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@supabase/supabase-js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;supabase&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;https://xyzcompany.supabase.co&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;public-anon-key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;supabase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  API endpoints and authentication function
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will now create our internal API endpoint, where we will be able to sign in and sign up. Later, we will also create one where we sign out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; folder, create a folder named &lt;code&gt;api&lt;/code&gt;, and inside it, create a file called &lt;code&gt;auth.js&lt;/code&gt;. This file will not be accessible via the browser, and only with our server, by using, for example, the &lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt; functions.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// api/auth.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;supabase&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;../../supabase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;method&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;remember&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;authType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;userData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class="k"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class="nx"&gt;userData&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;supabase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;signUpWithEmail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}));&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}));&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In our &lt;code&gt;index.svelte&lt;/code&gt;, we can then hook up our forms to a function that will call this API endpoint and redirect us to the dashboard if it works.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;authenticate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;authType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;remember&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;elements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;authAPI&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;/api/auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="na"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="na"&gt;authType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;authType&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;authAPI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;location&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;href&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;/dashboard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"submit"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Sign up&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We use &lt;code&gt;on:submit|preventDefault&lt;/code&gt; as it, well, prevents the page from refreshing on submit of the file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last part here is to implement a way for the session to know when the user is authenticated and also a way for the server to understand JSON, as that is what we send when we call the API. We can do that in the &lt;code&gt;server.js&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// server.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sirv&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;sirv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;compression&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;compression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sapper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@sapper/server&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cookieParser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;cookie-parser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;supabase&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;./supabase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  Explanation
  &lt;br&gt;
For the Supabase client, it's really simple. Using our project settings, we use Supabase's client library to create ourselves a client, that we can then use anywhere in our code to connect to our project.

&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;code&gt;auth.js&lt;/code&gt; file, things get a bit more busy. First of all, we check if the request was really made using &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt;. If it was, we extract the values we need to authenticate from &lt;code&gt;req.body&lt;/code&gt;, which we can use to check what type of authentication we are processing. Since the sign up and sign in functions both return the same data, we can use the same code to process them! Once we get the data, we check if there's any error, and if there is, we send the response back to the file that requested it. If there isn't any error, we check for data, which we then process a bit. First, we need to set the expiry times for the cookies we'll create. Using a ternary operator, we verify if the user checked the &lt;em&gt;Remember me&lt;/em&gt; box. If they did, we set the expiry time of the access token to 1 hour, and the refresh token's to 30 days. If they didn't we set it to zero, meaning it'll get erased when the browser closes. The cookie options we created basically mean that our cookie can only be accessed by the web server (&lt;code&gt;httpOnly&lt;/code&gt;) and not JavaScript, that it can be accessed on non-HTTPS websites (be sure to change &lt;code&gt;secure&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; on production websites) and that it can only be accessed if the site for the cookie matches the site currently shown in the browser's URL bar. We then send the response back to the page, with the new cookies and the &lt;code&gt;success&lt;/code&gt; set to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;index.svelte&lt;/code&gt; page executes the &lt;code&gt;authenticate()&lt;/code&gt; function when either of the form buttons are pressed. It gets the &lt;code&gt;event&lt;/code&gt; from the form and sets a custom parameter called &lt;code&gt;authType&lt;/code&gt; that gets used by our API. It then fetches the result, with a JSON payload containing the entered email and password, the &lt;em&gt;Remember me&lt;/em&gt; preference and the &lt;code&gt;authType&lt;/code&gt;. If the response is a success, it redirects the user to the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;server.js&lt;/code&gt; file got some additions too. First of all, we needed to import our new Supabase client, as well as the &lt;code&gt;json()&lt;/code&gt; function from &lt;code&gt;body-parser&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;cookie-parser&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;json()&lt;/code&gt; function enables us to read the &lt;code&gt;req.body&lt;/code&gt; correctly. Instead of automatically setting the &lt;code&gt;userToken&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;, we can now check if the token in the cookie (thanks to &lt;code&gt;cookie-parser&lt;/code&gt;) is valid using Supabase's &lt;code&gt;auth.api.getUser()&lt;/code&gt; function. This function returns a user property if the passed token is valid. If the cookie is valid, we put the token in the session.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now try authenticating and you should be redirected to the dashboard. You should also be able to see the cookies in your developer tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-5-sign-out-function" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 5: Sign out function
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will now create our the &lt;code&gt;signout&lt;/code&gt; API endpoint. In the &lt;code&gt;api&lt;/code&gt; folder, create a file named &lt;code&gt;signout.js&lt;/code&gt;. This file, like the others, will not be accessible via the browser, and only with our server. The contents of this file will be similar to the other one.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And now for our dashboard page.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;context=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"module"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;preload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;userToken&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;userToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;redirect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;302&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;userToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;signOut&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;authAPI&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;/api/signout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;method&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;credentials&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;same-origin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;authAPI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;location&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;href&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Everything here stays the same --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Our very cool dashboard&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;on:click=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"{ signOut }"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Sign out&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;
  Explanation
  &lt;br&gt;
For the &lt;code&gt;signout&lt;/code&gt; endpoint, we get the &lt;code&gt;supaToken&lt;/code&gt; from the request's cookies. Then, we sign out using Supabase's included methods. If all goes well, we clear all of the cookies (specifying the path is needed in order to clear the cookie) and we return &lt;code&gt;success&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;In our dashboard, the &lt;code&gt;signOut()&lt;/code&gt; function is quite similar to the &lt;code&gt;authenticate()&lt;/code&gt; in our login page. The main difference is that it uses our &lt;code&gt;signout&lt;/code&gt; endpoint, and it doesn't require a body, as it gets the token from the cookies.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-6-keeping-the-user-signed-in" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 6: Keeping the user signed in
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now our users can log in, which is great, but the access token (which is what we use to detect if the user is logged in) expires after 1 hour, which is gonna be a problem if our users either stay on the website for more than 1 hour or if they leave the website and then come back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This step is a bit more complex than the others, or at least it felt like it when I was figuring it out. This method will refresh the access token every 55 minutes, making sure it never expires, and if the user accesses the page with an expired token, it will also try to refresh it if possible. However, the only issue that I haven't figured out yet is how to make it work on protected pages correctly. So if somebody figures it out, I'd like to know how you did it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin this, we will create yet another API endpoint, called &lt;code&gt;refresh.js&lt;/code&gt;. This file will contain this code:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// api/refresh.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;supabase&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;../../supabase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;method&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cookies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;supaRefresh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;refreshToken&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cookies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;supaRefresh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;remember&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cookies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;supaRemember&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;supabase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;refreshAccessToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;refreshToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;refreshExpires&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;remember&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;30&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;24&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cookieOptions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;httpOnly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;secure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;sameSite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;strict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cookie&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;supaToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;access_token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;expires&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;tokenExpires&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cookieOptions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cookie&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;supaRefresh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;refresh_token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;expires&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;refreshExpires&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;/api/refresh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cookieOptions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;remember&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cookie&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;supaRemember&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;expires&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;refreshExpires&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cookieOptions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;supaToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;access_token&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}));&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;supaToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}));&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, since the code is extremely similar to our authentication code, we could just use the same endpoint, but I prefer keeping it separated due to the refresh token being a bit more sensitive info.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This code will be called in &lt;code&gt;_layout.svelte&lt;/code&gt; as the functions in this file are executed on every page.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- _layout.svelte --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onMount&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;svelte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;stores&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@sapper/app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;session&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;stores&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Nav&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;../components/Nav.svelte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;segment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onMount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;$session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;userToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;refresh&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`/api/refresh`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="na"&gt;method&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="na"&gt;credentials&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;same-origin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;supaToken&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;refresh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;supaToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;userToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;supaToken&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// refreshes token every 55 minutes to also sync with server-side.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;refresh&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`/api/refresh`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="na"&gt;method&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="na"&gt;credentials&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;same-origin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;supaToken&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;refresh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;supaToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;userToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;supaToken&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;No user, timeout will be killed eventually&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;55&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;
  Explanation
  &lt;br&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;refresh&lt;/code&gt; endpoint is basically identical to our &lt;code&gt;auth&lt;/code&gt; endpoint, so I will not be explaining it in details. The main difference here is that we return the &lt;code&gt;userToken&lt;/code&gt; instead of the &lt;code&gt;success&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;code&gt;_layout.svelte&lt;/code&gt; code is a bit more complex however. It uses Svelte's &lt;a href="https://svelte.dev/tutorial/onmount"&gt;&lt;code&gt;onMount()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; method to execute the code once the components appears in the DOM. It also gets the session from the Svelte's &lt;code&gt;stores&lt;/code&gt;. In the &lt;code&gt;onMount()&lt;/code&gt;, we check if the userToken exists. If it doesn't we try to refresh it using our new endpoint. We then use the returned token to update our session with the new, valid, access token. The cookies have already been set by the &lt;code&gt;refresh&lt;/code&gt; endpoint, so they're in sync. The interval at the bottom makes sure that a new access token gets generated every 55 minutes, so that it never invalidates, preventing our users from getting errors.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#were-done" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  We're done 🎉
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that's it! We are officially done with this and everything should work well! We now have a secure authentication flow that doesn't use client-side code using Sapper and Supabase. Stay tuned, as I will definitely make more tutorials using these 2 technologies soon(™).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to check out my projects, you can go to my &lt;a href="https://jakobbouchard.dev"&gt;portfolio&lt;/a&gt; or my &lt;a href="https://github.com/jakobbouchard"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;At the time of writing, my portfolio is getting remade from scratch as I don't like my current one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Supabase is free for now, but it will become paid in the future. However, if you sign up during the beta you get free credits!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or just want to say hello, leave a comment and I’ll be happy to reply! And obviously, if I missed something, tell me, I will credit you for the fix!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Longterm Benefits of Effective Product Development</title>
      <author>Ben Halpern</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 15 Feb 2021 22:11:40 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/ben/the-longterm-benefits-of-effective-product-development-1769</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/ben/the-longterm-benefits-of-effective-product-development-1769</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was reading the description of an upcoming project for our marketing team which started with this phrase...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usual campaign stuff -- templates, banner, sidebar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may seem innocuous, but everything we're now describing as "the usual stuff" used to be highly specialized hardcoded hacks that used to take entire engineering cycles to work on. Now it's just part of the product and can be lumped in as the baseline work. These days it is a task our marketing team can pull off. A year ago it was a big last-minute software project every time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since you're on DEV, you should have some familiarity with what we're talking about. DEV is built on &lt;a href="https://github.com/forem/forem"&gt;Forem&lt;/a&gt; (which was extracted from DEV) and includes functionality for running "campaigns" which is a highly flexible utilization of the site to launch specialized functionality without having to write new code into the core codebase. We use this for contests and partnerships. It's functionality we use consistently, but not too long ago this was a productivity pipe dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1rWplgHE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/automation_2x.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1rWplgHE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/automation_2x.png" alt="xkcd automation"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://xkcd.com/1319/"&gt;xkcd comic&lt;/a&gt; makes reference to the presumed futility of efforts to automate a certain type of task. It is so often the case that hard software projects &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to result in actual value creation that it is worth celebrating when it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work to "generalize" this functionality, make it re-usable for us and everyone who runs Forem, is an effort in longterm value creation that is easy to talk about abstractly, but seeing it in action as though taken for granted within our own team is still special. It's not necessarily easy to derive &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; productivity gains from the software we write. There are always tradeoffs. I've worked on a lot of projects which presume to offer actual business value or productivity wins but fail to provide that in practice. It's satisfying to take notice of the times when it does work out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year ago this was a big project with unknown payoff. Now it's just the "usual stuff".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shout out to &lt;a class="comment-mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/ridhwana"&gt;@ridhwana&lt;/a&gt;
 and &lt;a class="comment-mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/lightalloy"&gt;@lightalloy&lt;/a&gt;
 who did most of the work on this project.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Set Up Pagination in Gridsome</title>
      <author>Linda</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 15 Feb 2021 22:06:28 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/lindaojo/how-to-set-up-pagination-in-gridsome-1546</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/lindaojo/how-to-set-up-pagination-in-gridsome-1546</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3&gt;What is Gridsome&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gridsome is a modern website development framework for creating fast and secure websites that can be deployed anywhere. Static HTML files are generated to create SEO-friendly markup that hydrates into a Vue.js-powered SPA once loaded in the browser. Gridsome has also made it easier than ever before to set up pagination 😄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Steps to set up Gridsome Pagination&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am assuming that you already have a Gridsome blog that fetches blog posts and you are adding pagination as a new feature. In that case, these are the steps to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; - Setup Pagination in GraphQL query&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; - Import Gridsome's Pager component&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; - Add necessary styling&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Setup Pagination in GraphQL query&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data collection is handled by the GraphQL query in Gridsome. We can use the &lt;strong&gt;@paginate&lt;/strong&gt; directive in the GraphQL query to add automatic pagination for a collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The query will receive a &lt;strong&gt;$page: Int &lt;/strong&gt;variable you can use to load sources for a specific page.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;$page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;allBlogPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;perPage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;$page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;paginate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pageInfo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;totalPages&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentPage&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;edges&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;node&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the example above, each page will contain 10 blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Import Gridsome's Pager component&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gridsome has a built-in &lt;strong&gt;Pager&lt;/strong&gt; component which can be imported for easy pagination. Import and add the Pager component from Gridsome.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Pager&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;gridsome&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Pager&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though the Pager component can accept multiple properties, the only required properties are &lt;strong&gt;"total number of Pages"&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;"current Page"&lt;/strong&gt;. These properties can be found in &lt;strong&gt;"pageInfo"&lt;/strong&gt; which we pass into the Pager component.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;Pager&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;:info=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"$page.allBlogPost.pageInfo"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Add Custom Styles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can style the pagination container using normal CSS classes but need to use the &lt;strong&gt;:linkClass&lt;/strong&gt; property to style the links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Template&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;Pager&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;:info=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"$page.allBlogPost.pageInfo"&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"pager-container"&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="na"&gt;linkClass=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"pager-container__link"&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Styles&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;scoped&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;lang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;"scss"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.pager-container&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;inline-block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1.5rem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;text-align&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;black&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;amp;__link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;text-align&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.6rem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1.2rem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;white&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;text-decoration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.active&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;rgb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;44&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;201&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;180&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>React Effect Hook Explained</title>
      <author>Sandra Spanik</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 15 Feb 2021 20:35:34 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/sanspanic/react-effect-hook-explained-4npg</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/sanspanic/react-effect-hook-explained-4npg</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I've recently learned about React's inbuilt &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; hook and let me tell you - it's neat! 💙 It's commonly used to retrieve data from external APIs and handle timers. This article will walk you through a step-by-step implementation of a timer component via the &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; hook. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say our timer component should update each second, like so: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GwvanWu6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/sujc2do0pjeef432bk2w.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GwvanWu6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/sujc2do0pjeef432bk2w.gif" alt="Timer working"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're new to React, you might be tempted to define an interval at the top level of your component, as below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./TimerDemo.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;TimerDemo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;seconds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setSeconds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

 &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setSeconds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;TimerDemo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Timer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Demo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;⌛&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;seconds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;⌛&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;TimerDemo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the above code will result in the following output. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4qJEQgtx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/nwslr03dhxkawm9qaar3.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4qJEQgtx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/nwslr03dhxkawm9qaar3.gif" alt="Timer going mad"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's going on here? Has React broken the Universe and altered the rules of spacetime? 👽 Not quite. What's happening here is that multiple intervals are being set over and over in quick succession. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the component renders for the first time, the interval is set, which changes the state of &lt;code&gt;seconds&lt;/code&gt; each second. Once the state changes, a re-render of the entire component is immediately triggered, and the code inside the component runs once more. Upon running, the code will result in another, identical, interval being set. But the old interval will also continue doing its thing and manipulating the state of &lt;code&gt;seconds&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now we have two intervals that are both behaving the same way: updating state each second and triggering the component to re-render. Each re-render will lead to more fresh intervals being set, which in turn will trigger state change. This cycle - a positive feedback loop - will repeat ad infinitum (or more likely ad browser-crashium). 🔁&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The correct way to handle timers in React is by using the splendiferous &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; hook.&lt;/strong&gt; The top 3 things to know about this hook are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it accepts a &lt;em&gt;callback function&lt;/em&gt; as the 1st argument&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it accepts an &lt;em&gt;array&lt;/em&gt; as its optional 2nd argument&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it returns null, but can optionally be customised to return a &lt;em&gt;function&lt;/em&gt;, which is useful for "cleanup" purposes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it's hard to represent emojitively, because there isn't yet cross-browser support for the hook emoji, so here's an anchor instead ⚓ (okay, this one was a bonus)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll examine how each of these points relates to handling timers in React. (Except the emoji one. Which doesn't.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-raw-useeffect-endraw-callback-function" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; Callback Function
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first argument the hook accepts is a callback function. This function is what React understands to be the "effect". In this case, the effect is our interval. Let's define it inside a &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; hook.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;TimerDemo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;seconds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setSeconds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setSeconds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;TimerDemo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Timer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Demo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;⌛&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;seconds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;⌛&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This will display as the following: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bKeEkKap--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/nft8yusmarh7k1ftuaf4.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bKeEkKap--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/nft8yusmarh7k1ftuaf4.gif" alt="Timer still going mad"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not at all what we want, our issue remains. This is where the second argument of the &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; hook comes into play. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-useeffect-endraw-dependency-array" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; Dependency Array
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second argument is an optional array of state or prop values, which specify when the effect should run. We have 3 options here: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No array: if the array is left out, as in the previous code snippet, the effect will run after &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; render.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Empty array: the effect runs &lt;em&gt;once&lt;/em&gt; after the initial render. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Array with state or prop values: the effect runs &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; when any of these values change. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our case, if we passed in &lt;code&gt;[seconds]&lt;/code&gt;, we would tell React to re-run the effect each time the state of &lt;code&gt;seconds&lt;/code&gt; changes. Which would, of course, be completely pointless - in fact, this is exactly what we're trying to avoid. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And avoid it we can; specifically, by passing in an empty dependency array, &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt;. An empty array tells React to only run the effect once, after the component renders for the first time. Let's examine the code below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;TimerDemo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;seconds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setSeconds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setSeconds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;TimerDemo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Timer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Demo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;⌛&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;seconds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;⌛&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GwvanWu6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/sujc2do0pjeef432bk2w.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GwvanWu6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/sujc2do0pjeef432bk2w.gif" alt="Timer working"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voila! The timer works now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#useeffect-return-function" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  useEffect Return Function
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what would happen to the interval if we removed the timer component from the DOM? Let's create a scenario where it is removed by wrapping it in another component, Clock, which toggles the timer component. Let's also include a toggle button that removes or adds the timer component to the DOM.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Clock&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isHidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setIsHidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;toggle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setIsHidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Clock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isHidden&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;TimerDemo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Clock-btn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toggle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Toggle&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--08FbaHch--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/72gr7cv0vo6127twhziz.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--08FbaHch--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/72gr7cv0vo6127twhziz.gif" alt="Timer seemingly working as intended"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first glance, removing the TimerDemo component from the DOM appears to work as intended. But upon opening the console, an angry sea of red appears. React is not happy. 😡&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mLFui1gO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/dsv3pvy5rknl2j34uxaj.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mLFui1gO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/dsv3pvy5rknl2j34uxaj.png" alt="Error message"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this? Well, when the component is removed, despite disappearing visually, the interval associated with it simply keeps going. There's nothing telling it to stop executing. The interval will proceed to try and update the state of a currently unmounted component, greatly upsetting React in the process. Poor React! 🥺&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how do we tell the interval to stop when the component is removed from the DOM? By specifying &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt;'s return value. By default, it returns null, but we can modify this to return a callback function, which will act as "cleanup". Warning: the cleanup function can feel a bit abstract to read about, and the best way to befriend it is to use it and explore its functionality first-hand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cleanup is executed at the following times: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the initial rendering, the hook &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; invokes the effect. The cleanup function &lt;em&gt;doesn't&lt;/em&gt; run&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On all following re-renderings, the cleanup from the previous effect execution is invoked &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt;, after which the current effect runs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cleanup also runs &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the component is unmounted, i.e. removed from the DOM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's define our cleanup function. In order to stop an interval, we need to capture the interval ID and pass it into a &lt;code&gt;clearInterval&lt;/code&gt; function (a vanilla JS concept). We'll return this function inside our &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; and add some print statements to monitor the sequence of execution.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;I am the effect. PARTY! 🎺 👐 🎉&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;timerId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setSeconds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Cleaning up... 🙄 🧹🧼&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;clearInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;timerId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XRJ-HlYN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/rxoarrw7bkrw3blcbvov.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XRJ-HlYN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/rxoarrw7bkrw3blcbvov.gif" alt="cleanup function demonstration"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, the effect runs when the component is mounted, but never again, due to our 2nd argument, the dependency array, being empty. Therefore, the cleanup function will only run when the component is unmounted, thereby clearing the interval and preventing the error message. The toggle button now works as intended, and React is so happy it can barely contain its excitement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I hope you are too, after making it through this tutorial! 👏&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://graphql.org/"&gt;GraphQL&lt;/a&gt; has been gaining a lot of traction with enterprises and startups for their application data layers. Historically, the web has been built using &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer"&gt;REST&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP"&gt;SOAP&lt;/a&gt; APIs which have served their purpose successfully for years, but as applications have gotten more complicated and data has become richer, these solutions have created friction in developing performant software quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we'll briefly discuss some of the problems with traditional API solutions, the benefits of migrating to GraphQL, and the strategy for migrating to a GraphQL solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#traditional-api-problems" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Traditional API Problems
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In traditional API systems, we typically suffer from a few common issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data under-fetching or n+1 fetching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data over-fetching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All-or-nothing Responses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of batch support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#data-underfetching" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Data Under-fetching
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional resources require us to request data on a per-entity basis, e.g. only users or only posts. For example, using REST, if we want to get some user details and their posts, we'd have to make the following requests:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;GET /users/1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;GET /users/1/posts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#data-overfetching" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Data Over-fetching
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, when we request certain data, it will give us all the available information including data we might not care about. From our previous example, we might only want a user's name and username but the response might provide us their creation time and bio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#allornothing-responses" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  All-or-nothing Responses
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if there's an error somewhere in this process, we might not get any data. Instead, we receive an HTTP status code informing us of a failure with an error message but none of the data that was fetchable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lack-of-batch-support" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Lack of Batch Support
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, for our more complex page, we might need to run multiple requests that can be parallelized but traditional APIs don't support this behavior out of the box. Dashboards, for example, might need sales and marketing data which will require our clients to make two separate requests to our server and wait on results before displaying that data causing perceived slowness in our application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-graphql-advantage" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The GraphQL Advantage
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of the box, GraphQL solves all of these described issues due to its declarative querying syntax and data handling. When you fetch data, you can request the exact data you need, and using the connection among entities, you can retrieve those relationships in a single request. If any of the data fails to fetch, GraphQL will still tell you about the data that was successfully retrieved and about the failures in fetching the other data, allowing you to show your users data regardless of failures. GraphQL also allows you to group multiple operations in a single request and fetch all data from a single request, thus reducing the number of round trips to your server and increasing perceived speed of your application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these features, GraphQL creates a single gateway for your clients, reducing friction in team communication around how data should be fetched. Your API is now abstracted away behind a single endpoint that also provides documentation on how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="//images.ctfassets.net/zojzzdop0fzx/37NhItaEgKCFvNSbLCoJP9/165f732ddeeb7f1e8bfeb7c01fde12bb/graphql_architecture.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="//images.ctfassets.net/zojzzdop0fzx/37NhItaEgKCFvNSbLCoJP9/165f732ddeeb7f1e8bfeb7c01fde12bb/graphql_architecture.png" alt="GraphQL Architecture"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given all these advantages, it's no wonder teams are moving to GraphQL, but it leaves the question of: how?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#migration-strategy" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Migration Strategy
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GraphQL migration strategy is incremental so you don't have to slow down development to port over existing data or endpoints until you're ready to opt into those changes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#0-before-you-begin" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  0. Before you begin
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you start migration, here are some suggestions to think about as you're building new features or modifying the system in any way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't build any new REST endpoints.&lt;/strong&gt; Any new REST work is going to be additional GraphQL work later. Do yourself a favor and build it in GraphQL already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't maintain your current REST endpoints.&lt;/strong&gt; Porting REST endpoints to GraphQL is simple and GraphQL will provide you more functionality to build the exact behavior you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leverage your existing REST endpoints to prototype quickly.&lt;/strong&gt; You can use your existing REST API to power your GraphQL implementation. This won't be sustainable or performant long term, but it's a great way to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-pick-your-graphql-implementation" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Pick your GraphQL Implementation
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apollographql.com/"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://relay.dev/"&gt;Relay&lt;/a&gt; are the two most popular fullstack GraphQL solutions, but you can also build your own solutions. Regardless of what you use, you'll use this to implement your server endpoint and connect to it with your client. All GraphQL requests go through a single endpoint, so once this is up and running, you can connect to it and begin porting functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-select-your-first-feature-to-build-or-port" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Select your first feature to build or port
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our server, we can start adding to it. Following our earlier example, let's migrate user posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-define-your-schema-types" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Define your schema types
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we've decided on user posts, we have two routes here: (1) migrate users and posts or (2) migrate posts with a filter on user. For this, we're going to migrate posts and filter on user ID for now. To start, we'll define our &lt;code&gt;post&lt;/code&gt; type in the schema and define its query type:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;type Post {
  id: ID!
  userId: ID!
  content: String!
}

type Query {
  posts(userId: ID): [Post]
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We now have a &lt;code&gt;Post&lt;/code&gt; type that has an id and content and knows which user it belongs to. Additonally, we have a query called &lt;code&gt;Posts&lt;/code&gt; that optionally accepts a userId as a filter and returns a list of &lt;code&gt;Post&lt;/code&gt;s. It's important to note that it is semantically incorrect in GraphQL to expose the &lt;code&gt;userId&lt;/code&gt; as a field. Instead, we should connect a post to its user and expose that entity relation, but those will be choices you make as you design your API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-build-our-data-resolver" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Build our data resolver
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we need to connect our schema type and query to our data. For this, we'll use a resolver. The following syntax will vary slightly pending your server implementation, but using JavaScript and the GraphQL specification, we'd end up with the following resolver object:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;node-fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolvers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;Query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;posts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;API_URL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;userId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;userId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;API_URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/users/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;userId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/posts`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;API_URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/posts`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the &lt;code&gt;userId&lt;/code&gt; is present in the query arguments, we use our existing REST API to fetch the posts by user, but if no &lt;code&gt;userId&lt;/code&gt; is provided, we use the &lt;code&gt;posts&lt;/code&gt; route directly. Now, we can make the following request on the frontend to retrieve our data:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight graphql"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;UserPosts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$userId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;!)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;posts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;userId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$userId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I chose to use &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch"&gt;node-fetch&lt;/a&gt; for my implementation because it was simple, but you can use any HTTP library of your choice. However, if you're in the Apollo ecosystem, they've built a &lt;a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/data-sources/"&gt;RESTDataSource&lt;/a&gt; library that will create an extension to your GraphQL implementation for handling resolvers to microservice APIs that can setup the boilerplate for that service so you only worry about fetching the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-next-steps" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Next Steps
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#extending-our-graph" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Extending Our Graph
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have our data integrated, we need to complete the graph by connecting related types. Instead of &lt;code&gt;Post&lt;/code&gt; having a &lt;code&gt;userId&lt;/code&gt;, it can have a &lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt; and fetch the author details directly from the same query, e.g.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight graphql"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;UserPosts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$userId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;!)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;posts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;userId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$userId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;avatarUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;displayName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#monoliths" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Monoliths
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we now have queries and types with full control of our schema, we can update our resolver functionality to rely on the codebase and not our REST API abstraction which will give us some added perfromance benefits. We can keep stitching together new types and extend our API further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#microservices" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Microservices
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GraphQL and microservices go hand-in-hand pretty well. GraphQL supports schema stitching, which allows us to build individual GraphQL APIs in our microservices and then combine them to make up our larger interface. Now, instead of configuring our clients to define all the different connections to different services, our GraphQL server understands where to collect all the data from,  simplifying the amount of information the frontend needs to know about in order to complete requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#performance" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Performance
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major downside to GraphQL can be the server-side overfetching, or n+1 problem. Because GraphQL doesn't know exactly how data is structured in the database, it cannot optimize for redundant requests in the graph tree. However, the &lt;a href="https://github.com/graphql/dataloader"&gt;GraphQL DataLoader&lt;/a&gt; library is here to solve exactly that. It determines any data that's already been fetched and caches for use in any sub-query to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all this power, it's no wonder GraphQL is picking up so much steam in the community. That being said, GraphQL isn't for everyone or might not be a good solution for your team today. However, I would suspect lots of future APIs we rely upon will start utilizing GraphQL more heavily and we'll see a trend away from traditional REST. Hopefully, you've seen the opportunity of GraphQL in your codebase and how it will help your team deliver quality products faster, and you can have a conversation with your team about a possible migration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Implementing Async/Await</title>
      <author>Giovanni Sarciotto</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 15 Feb 2021 19:33:30 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/gsarciotto/implementing-async-await-55f</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/gsarciotto/implementing-async-await-55f</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On my last &lt;a href="https://dev.to/gsarciotto/generators-in-typescript-4b37"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; we saw the theory behind generators in JS/TS. In this article I will apply those concepts and show how we can use generators to build something similar to &lt;strong&gt;async/await&lt;/strong&gt;. In fact, &lt;em&gt;async/await&lt;/em&gt; is implemented using generators and promises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#delving-into-async-with-callbacks" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Delving into async with callbacks
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we will show how we can deal with asynchronicity using generators by writing an example with callbacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is as follows. When using callbacks, we pass some function that will be called whenever the async action has finished. So what if we don't call a callback, but instead call &lt;code&gt;next&lt;/code&gt; on some generator? Better yet, what if this generator is the code that called our async function? That way we would have a code that calls some asynchronous process, stays paused while the asynchronous process isn't finished and return its execution whenever it is ready. Check this out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cOUK83Ym--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/dvldwnp4jizbycl8ybxw.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cOUK83Ym--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/dvldwnp4jizbycl8ybxw.png" alt="Implementation with callbacks"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't know what is &lt;code&gt;...args&lt;/code&gt; in the implementation above, take a look at &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax"&gt;spread syntax&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
We wrap our asynchronous operations with &lt;code&gt;asyncWrapper&lt;/code&gt;. This wrapper just pass a callback to give control back to the generator &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; whenever the async process is completed. Notice how our code in main looks totally synchronous. In fact, just looking at &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;, we can't assert if there is anything asynchronous at all, although the &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; gives a hint. Also notice how our code is very similar to what it would have been with &lt;code&gt;async/await&lt;/code&gt;, even though we don't use &lt;code&gt;Promises&lt;/code&gt;. This is because we are abstracting away the asynchronous portions from our consuming code &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using callbacks like above is fine, but there are some problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The code feels weird. Why should &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; know about &lt;code&gt;asyncWrapper&lt;/code&gt;? &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; should be able to just call the async operation and everything should be handled in the background.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where would we do error handling? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if the asynchronous operations calls the callback multiple times? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if we wanted to run multiple async operations in parallel? Since a yield corresponds to a pause in execution, we would need to add some complicated code to decide if when we call &lt;code&gt;next&lt;/code&gt; is it to execute another operation or is it because an asynchronous operation has finished?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have the problems that normal callbacks do (callback hell, etc).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#promises-to-the-rescue" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Promises to the rescue
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can solve the problems above utilizing &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise"&gt;Promises&lt;/a&gt;. We will begin with a simple implementation with only one yield and no error handling and then expand it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we need to make our asynchronous operation &lt;code&gt;addAsync&lt;/code&gt; return a promise, we will deal with the case that it doesn't later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wGsqXan1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/jpn26dpnhypfgbo30wkl.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wGsqXan1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/jpn26dpnhypfgbo30wkl.png" alt="addAsync with Promises"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve 1, we need to change our &lt;em&gt;wrapper&lt;/em&gt; to receive the code that we want to execute, becoming a &lt;em&gt;runner&lt;/em&gt;. This way our &lt;em&gt;runner&lt;/em&gt; does the things it needs and gives control back to our code whenever it is ready, while hiding how anything works from our code. The &lt;em&gt;runner&lt;/em&gt; needs to do essentially two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initialize our code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take the promise that is yielded to it, wait for its fulfillment and then give control back to our code with the resolved value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hsMW1czX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/zr3itox2mup29o7a3e87.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hsMW1czX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/zr3itox2mup29o7a3e87.png" alt="Basic runner implementation"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that's it! The problem 3 from our list is automatically solved whenever we use promises. The full code is the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hMvg2OiK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/xchigo3qouuhfu038vb2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hMvg2OiK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/xchigo3qouuhfu038vb2.png" alt="Basic implementation with promises"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's walk through the execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First we call our &lt;em&gt;runner&lt;/em&gt; with the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function generator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;runner&lt;/em&gt; initializes our generator and then calls &lt;code&gt;it.next()&lt;/code&gt;. This gives control to &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Main executes until the &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt;. It yields the return value of &lt;code&gt;addAsync&lt;/code&gt;, which is a promise. This promise is unfulfilled at the moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now the control is with the &lt;em&gt;runner&lt;/em&gt;. It unwraps the value from the generator yield and gets the promise. It adds a &lt;code&gt;.then&lt;/code&gt; that will pass the value of the fulfilled promise to &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whenever the promised is resolved and the &lt;em&gt;runner&lt;/em&gt; gives control to &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;, the yield expression evaluates to the resolved value of the promise (5) and continues the execution until the end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dealing-with-nonpromises-values" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Dealing with non-Promises values
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment, our &lt;em&gt;runner&lt;/em&gt; expects to receive a &lt;em&gt;Promise&lt;/em&gt;. However, by the spec, you can await any value, &lt;em&gt;Promise&lt;/em&gt; or not. Fortunately, to solve this is very easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the following synchronous add function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--I2y8jvj---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/yklr70v9bs1cbwzsit77.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--I2y8jvj---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/yklr70v9bs1cbwzsit77.png" alt="Synchronous add function"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This code crashes our generator, since our generator tries to call a &lt;code&gt;.then&lt;/code&gt; to the yielded value. We can solve this by using &lt;code&gt;Promise.resolve&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;Promise.resolve(arg)&lt;/code&gt; copies arg if it is a &lt;em&gt;Promise&lt;/em&gt;, otherwise it wraps arg in a &lt;em&gt;Promise&lt;/em&gt;. So our &lt;em&gt;runner&lt;/em&gt; becomes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--whT9ZRUm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/6gkrbw7glebyvl4sqmls.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--whT9ZRUm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/6gkrbw7glebyvl4sqmls.png" alt="Runner is now able to deal with non-Promise values"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now our code doesn't crash with non-Promise values:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LOGXTU9r--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/lir8wuy71zma0yqc3go8.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LOGXTU9r--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/lir8wuy71zma0yqc3go8.png" alt="Execution with synchronous function"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we run our code with &lt;code&gt;addAsync&lt;/code&gt;, we will get the same behavior as before!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dealing-with-errors" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Dealing with errors
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we are using &lt;em&gt;Promises&lt;/em&gt;, we can easily get any error/rejection that happens in our asynchronous operations. Whenever a promise rejection occurs, our runner should simply unwrap the rejection reason and give it to the generator to allow for handling. We can do this with the &lt;code&gt;.throw&lt;/code&gt; method:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uZrjs56n--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/dg41bq5wnqt6h3u7e9ri.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uZrjs56n--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/dg41bq5wnqt6h3u7e9ri.png" alt="Error handling example"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now not only we add a &lt;code&gt;.then&lt;/code&gt;, but also a &lt;code&gt;.catch&lt;/code&gt; to the yielded &lt;em&gt;Promise&lt;/em&gt; and if a rejection occurs, we throw the reason to &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;. Notice that this also handles the case where we are performing a synchronous operation and there is a normal &lt;code&gt;throw&lt;/code&gt;. Since our runner sits below &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; in the execution stack, this error will first bubble to the &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; and be handled there in the &lt;code&gt;try...catch&lt;/code&gt;. If there was no &lt;code&gt;try...catch&lt;/code&gt;, then it would have bubbled up to the &lt;em&gt;runner&lt;/em&gt; and since our &lt;em&gt;runner&lt;/em&gt; doesn't have any &lt;code&gt;try...catch&lt;/code&gt; it would bubble up again, the same as in &lt;em&gt;async/await&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dealing-with-multiple-yields" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Dealing with multiple yields
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've come a long way. Right now our code is able to deal with one &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt;. Our code is already able to run multiple parallel asynchronous operations because we are using &lt;em&gt;Promises&lt;/em&gt;, therefore &lt;code&gt;Promise.all&lt;/code&gt; and other methods comes for free. Our runner, however isn't able to run multiple &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; statements. Take the following generator:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AJxVBdl6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/aepgdtujmv9p3cynmhkh.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AJxVBdl6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/aepgdtujmv9p3cynmhkh.png" alt="Generator with multiple yields"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;em&gt;runner&lt;/em&gt; will deal with the first &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; just fine, however it won't correctly give control back to &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; at all in the second &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt;, the timeout will finish and nothing will happen. We need to add some iteration capability to the &lt;em&gt;runner&lt;/em&gt; so that we can correctly process multiple &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; statements. Look at the following code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EQTipJxj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/c1pb6jjknq026esvedt9.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EQTipJxj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/c1pb6jjknq026esvedt9.png" alt="Multi-yield code"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use recursion with an &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE"&gt;IIFE&lt;/a&gt; to iterate through the generator. Instead of directly calling &lt;code&gt;.next&lt;/code&gt;, we recursively call this &lt;em&gt;IIFE&lt;/em&gt; with the unwrapped value of the promise. The first thing the function does is to give control back to the generator with the unwrapped value. The cycle then repeats if there is another &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt;. Notice that on the last &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; (or if there isn't any), then the generator will end and give control back to the runner. The runner checks if the generator has ended and finishes execution if positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one problem however: if one of the promises rejects, then the cycle is broken and our runner doesn't run correctly. To fix this we need to add an error flag and call &lt;code&gt;.next&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;.throw&lt;/code&gt; based on this flag:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wN_rkUnf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/09vxzmm2g31t09dsid92.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wN_rkUnf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/09vxzmm2g31t09dsid92.png" alt="Multi-yield runner with error handling"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've implemented something really close to &lt;em&gt;async/await&lt;/em&gt;. If you look at the &lt;a href="https://v8.dev/blog/fast-async"&gt;V8 blog&lt;/a&gt; you will notice that our program does essentially the same thing. I suggest reading the blog post above, there is a cool optimization that if you &lt;em&gt;await&lt;/em&gt; promises, then the engine is so optimized that your code will run faster than just using promises with a &lt;code&gt;.then&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this post I finish writing about generators, at least for now. There is an interesting topic that I didn't touch that is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine"&gt;coroutines&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to read about it, I recommended this &lt;a href="https://davidwalsh.name/concurrent-generators"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my next post I think I will write about &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol"&gt;Symbol&lt;/a&gt; or the Myers diff algorithm (the default diff algorithm for git). If you have any doubts, sugestions or anything just comment below! Until next time :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Generators in Typescript</title>
      <author>Giovanni Sarciotto</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 15 Feb 2021 19:33:03 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/gsarciotto/generators-in-typescript-4b37</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/gsarciotto/generators-in-typescript-4b37</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post we will understand what ES2015 generators are in Javascript/Typescript. Generators rely heavily on iterators, so if you don't know or would like to refresh your memory, take a look at my last &lt;a href="https://dev.to/gsarciotto/iterators-in-typescript-1d78"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we know, iterators allows us to have total control of iterating through some structure, we get to decide if and when we get the next element of our iteration sequence, while hiding from our iterator's consumers implementation details of how we get these elements. However, everything has a cost, iterators can be quite tricky to implement since we have to keep track of the states that will control the flow of execution so that we can, for example, mark the iterator as complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generators allows us to easily create iterators, making possible to implement some really cool stuff like stopping execution of functions to resume them later (sounds familiar to &lt;code&gt;async/await&lt;/code&gt;?), pass values to the generator between these pauses and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-basics" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The basics
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generators can be quite complicated and somewhat different from what we are used to, so pay close attention to the details. A generator declaration is very similar to a function declaration:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fooGen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Hello from fooGen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Hello from foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You define a generator by using &lt;code&gt;function* fooGen&lt;/code&gt; (you can actually do &lt;code&gt;function * fooGen&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;function *fooGen&lt;/code&gt;). This is the only difference between our generator declaration and  the declaration of our &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; function but they actually behave very differently. Consider the following:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Hello from foo&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fooGen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our invocation of &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; is as expected, however the invocation of &lt;code&gt;fooGen&lt;/code&gt; didn't log anything. That seems odd, but this is the first big difference between functions and generators. &lt;strong&gt;Functions&lt;/strong&gt; are &lt;strong&gt;eager&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning whenever invoked, they will immediately begin execution while &lt;strong&gt;generators&lt;/strong&gt; are &lt;strong&gt;lazy&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning they will only execute our code whenever you explicitly tell them to execute. You may argue "but I ordered it to execute", however calling the generator doesn't execute its code, it only does some internal initialization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do I tell a generator to execute &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; code? First let's see what &lt;code&gt;fooGen()&lt;/code&gt; returns us. If we look at the type of &lt;code&gt;fooGen&lt;/code&gt;, we will see the following: &lt;code&gt;function fooGen(): Generator&amp;lt;never, void, unknown&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, so let's look at what this &lt;code&gt;Generator&lt;/code&gt; type is:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Generator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;TReturn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;TNext&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Iterator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;TReturn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;TNext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// NOTE: 'next' is defined using a tuple to ensure we report the correct assignability errors in all places.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;TNext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;IteratorResult&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;TReturn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;TReturn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;IteratorResult&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;TReturn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;IteratorResult&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;TReturn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Symbol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;iterator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Generator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;TReturn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;TNext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wait, this interface has a &lt;code&gt;next&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;throw&lt;/code&gt; methods isn't this an &lt;strong&gt;iterator&lt;/strong&gt;? The answer is yes, but also notice that it is an &lt;strong&gt;iterable&lt;/strong&gt;. So this interface is actually somewhat similar to the &lt;code&gt;IterableIterator&lt;/code&gt; interface. If you want to know why they aren't the same, take a look at this &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58568399/why-are-typescripts-iterableiterator-and-generator-generics-slightly-differ"&gt;question&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To order the generator to execute our code, we only need to call &lt;code&gt;next&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Hello from foo&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fooGen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Hello from fooGen&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's return some value from our generator:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fooGen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Hello from fGen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Bye from fGen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fooGen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Hello from fGen&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// { value: 'Bye from fGen', done: true }&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// { value: undefined, done: true }&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notice that when you &lt;strong&gt;return&lt;/strong&gt; something from a generator, it automatically completes the iterator, no need to manage state. Also notice that the value of the &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; expression is returned only once, subsequent calls to &lt;code&gt;it.next&lt;/code&gt; return &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; in the value. Keep in mind that if there is no explicit &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; statement on your function or if the execution didn't reach a logical branch with the return, then &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; is assumed to be the return value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-raw-yield-endraw-keyword" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; keyword
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far we didn't do anything exciting with generators, we just used them as some more complicated functions. As said in the introduction, we can pause the execution of generators. We achieve this using the &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; keyword.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; keyword pauses the execution of our iterator.&lt;br&gt;
Whenever we call &lt;code&gt;next&lt;/code&gt;, the generator will synchronously execute our code until a &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; or a &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; statement is reached (assuming no errors happened, which we will see later). If the generator was in a paused state and we call &lt;code&gt;next&lt;/code&gt; again it will resume the execution from wherever it was paused from.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fooGen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Begin execution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;yield&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;End execution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fooGen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;The generator is paused&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Begin execution&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// The generator is paused&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// End execution&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can use &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; to allow our generator to "return" multiple values (we say the generator yields these). We do this as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fooGen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Begin execution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;yield&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;This value was yielded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;End execution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fooGen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;The generator is paused&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Begin execution&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// { value: 'This value was yielded', done: false }&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// The generator is paused&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// End execution&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notice that using &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; doesn't complete the generator iterator. This is very powerful. One example of where this behavior is useful is for producing (infinite) sequences in a memory efficient way, for example, let's look how we can implement &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number"&gt;Fibonacci sequence&lt;/a&gt; using generators.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fibonacciGenerator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;f0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;yield&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;f0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;f1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;yield&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;f1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;previousValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;f0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;f1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nextValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nextValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;previousValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;previousValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nextValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;yield&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nextValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fibonacciGenerator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;

    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notice how the lazy nature of generators is very useful and how the ability to pause execution allows us to generate infinite elements of the sequence (let's ignore possible integer overflows) whenever we want while only needing to save the previous and the current values. Quite nice isn't it? Notice that we don't actually need to complete a generator, we may only take some values and never call &lt;code&gt;next&lt;/code&gt; again, although I wouldn't recommend that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#passing-values-to-the-generator" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Passing values to the generator
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two ways we can pass values to our generator. One is just as we would to a function, when creating the generator iterator. Let's expand the Fibonacci example to allow us to choose where to start the sequence:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fibonacciGenerator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;startingPosition&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;f0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;startingPosition&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;yield&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;f0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;f1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;startingPosition&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;yield&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;f1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;previousValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;f0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;f1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nextValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentPosition&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nextValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;previousValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;previousValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nextValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentPosition&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;startingPosition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;yield&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nextValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentPosition&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fibonacciGenerator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 3&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;it2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fibonacciGenerator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 13&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The other way to pass values to a generator is through &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt;. You may be confused, since until now we have been using &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; to, well, yield values from the generator. The truth is that &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; is an expression, meaning it evaluates to some value. To clarify, let's look at this example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fooGen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;yield&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fooGen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;heey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// heey&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first call of &lt;code&gt;it.next()&lt;/code&gt; will simply initiate execution of our generator iterator. Whenever it finds the &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; expression, it will simply stop execution. Whenever we do &lt;code&gt;it.next(1)&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; will evaluate to the value &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; and thus we have &lt;code&gt;console.log(1)&lt;/code&gt; and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is allowed:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;accumulator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;startingValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Generator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;startingValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;yield&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;accumulator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 13&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First the code is executed until the &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; is found, yielding &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;startingValue&lt;/code&gt;) . Whenever we call &lt;code&gt;next(3)&lt;/code&gt;, the expression &lt;code&gt;yield value&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt;, so now &lt;code&gt;input === 3&lt;/code&gt; and then &lt;code&gt;value === 3&lt;/code&gt;. The cycle then repeats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A comment above about types. I had to explicitly type the generator above so that Typescript could automatically detect the type of &lt;code&gt;input&lt;/code&gt;. The type inference of yield expressions is an &lt;a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/32523"&gt;ongoing struggle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attention&lt;/strong&gt;: Whatever you pass to the &lt;strong&gt;first&lt;/strong&gt; invocation of &lt;code&gt;next&lt;/code&gt; will be ignored, so watch out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#error-handling" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Error Handling
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code of our generator is just like any other function code, meaning we can put &lt;code&gt;try...catch&lt;/code&gt; blocks inside it:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fooGen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Err caught in fooGen:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;End of execution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fooGen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Err caught in fooGen: Hi&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// { value: "End of execution", done: true }&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// { value: undefined, done: true }&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notice that after the exception was handled, the generator continued its execution. If we didn't have a &lt;code&gt;try...catch&lt;/code&gt; inside the generator, the exception would bubble as it would normally:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fooGen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;End of execution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fooGen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Exception caught outside of generator: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Exception caught outside of generator:  Hi&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// { value: undefined, done: true }&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notice that our generator was completed because of the uncaught exception and didn't reach our return statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also throw errors from outside our generator to the inside:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fooGen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Beginning of execution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;yield&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Error caught inside fooGen: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;End of execution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fooGen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Hi from outside&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Beginning of execution&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Error caught inside fooGen:  Hi from outside&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// { value: 'End of execution', done: true }&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// { value: undefined, done: true }&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notice that the error was thrown at the point that the generator execution paused. If there was no &lt;code&gt;try...catch&lt;/code&gt; at that point, then it would have bubbled as normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of where we would like to use &lt;code&gt;Generator.throw&lt;/code&gt; is with our Fibonacci example. As it is implemented, eventually we will run into an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow#:~:text=In%20computer%20programming,%20an%20integer,than%20the%20minimum%20representable%20value"&gt;overflow&lt;/a&gt;. We can avoid this by using &lt;a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-bigint/blob/master/README.md"&gt;bigInt&lt;/a&gt;. In our case, we just want to complete the iterator when overflow happens.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fibonacciGenerator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;f0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;yield&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;f0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;f1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;yield&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;f1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;previousValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;f0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;f1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nextValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nextValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;previousValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;previousValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nextValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;yield&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nextValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;flag&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fibonacciGenerator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;flag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;MAX_SAFE_INTEGER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;isFinite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;overflow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;overflow detected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;flag&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whenever we detect an overflow from outside our generator, we simply call &lt;code&gt;it.throw&lt;/code&gt; to complete it so that no other garbage value gets generated from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#generator-delegation" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Generator Delegation
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may compose two or more generator using generator delegation &lt;code&gt;yield*&lt;/code&gt; syntax:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;g1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;yield&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;yield&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;yield&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;g2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;yield&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;yield&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;g1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;yield&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;iterator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;g2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;iterator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// {value: 1, done: false}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;iterator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// {value: 2, done: false}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;iterator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// {value: 3, done: false}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;iterator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// {value: 4, done: false}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;iterator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// {value: 5, done: false}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;iterator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// {value: undefined, done: true}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What happens is that whenever a &lt;code&gt;yield*&lt;/code&gt; is encountered, every subsequent &lt;code&gt;next&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;throw&lt;/code&gt; will go to the delegated generator, &lt;code&gt;g2&lt;/code&gt; in this case. This happens until &lt;code&gt;g2&lt;/code&gt; completes and the completion value of &lt;code&gt;g2&lt;/code&gt; is the value of &lt;code&gt;yield* g2()&lt;/code&gt;. The subsequent call to &lt;code&gt;next&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code&gt;g1&lt;/code&gt; after &lt;code&gt;g2&lt;/code&gt; completes will continue from where &lt;code&gt;g1&lt;/code&gt; was paused as normal. This is how you may write &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine"&gt;coroutines&lt;/a&gt; in Javascript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can actually use &lt;code&gt;yield*&lt;/code&gt; with any iterable, such as arrays.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generators are a somewhat obscure but very interesting structure in Javascript. You probably won't find a generator in the wild, however it is good to know of their existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can build very cool stuff with generators, &lt;em&gt;Async/Await&lt;/em&gt; is implemented with generators and promises. If you want to learn more, see my next &lt;a href="https://dev.to/gsarciotto/implementing-async-await-55f"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any doubts or sugestions, feel free to add a comment. Stay safe and until next time :)&lt;/p&gt;
