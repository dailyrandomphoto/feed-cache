&lt;p&gt;Hello Devs, If you want to become a frontend developer in 2022 and wondering what you should learn to become a professional web developer in 2022, but is not sure about which &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/02/top-10-highest-paying-technical-jobs-programmers-software-developers.html"&gt;technologies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.java67.com/2018/04/10-tools-java-developers-should-learn.html"&gt;tools&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/10-of-the-most-popular-javascript-libraries-for-frontend-and-backend-development-ph1h0326n"&gt;framework&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.java67.com/2018/09/10-high-paying-technologies-programmers-can-learn.html"&gt;languages&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.java67.com/2019/01/top-10-javascript-frameworks-and-libraries-for-web-developers.html"&gt;libraries&lt;/a&gt; to learn, then you have come to the right place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, I am going to share some of the most essential things a frontend developer should know. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being an author of a &lt;a href="http://java67.com/"&gt;technical blog&lt;/a&gt;, I often receive questions like what tools and technologies should a web developer learn? Which programming languages are suitable for web development, and what skills are necessary? I am going to answer all those questions from my reader in a series of blog posts, and this is the first one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, I am going to share the most &lt;em&gt;essential things a web developer should know&lt;/em&gt;, which obviously includes the big three of Web development - &lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/5-free-html-and-css-courses-to-learn-front-end-web-development-online-8b04517c6ecb"&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.java67.com/2019/01/5-free-bootstrap-course-to-learn-online.html"&gt;CSS&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/10-websites-to-learn-javascript-for-beginners-31e13bbdbb5c"&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;, and several other useful tools that are essential but not mentioned or taught together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for surprises or shiny new technologies like &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/05/top-3-courses-to-learn-sveltejs-in-2020.html"&gt;Svelte.js&lt;/a&gt; or WebAssembly, then I am sorry they are not part of this article, as I don't think they are essential for all web developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They might be good for a seasoned web developer looking to learn a new JavaScript framework but not something a beginner should learn. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, this article is based upon my own practical experience and contains the most essential thing a Web developer should learn in 2022, mainly a frontend developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Btw, if you are an experienced web developer then I don't want to disappoint you, and I'll write about those new &lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/these-are-the-highest-paying-tech-jobs-programmers-can-aim-to-increase-their-pay-c59e1eeb6904"&gt;technologies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://dev.to/javinpaul/top-10-javascript-frameworks-libraries-web-developers-can-learn-in-2020-4jn1"&gt;frameworks&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/10-javascript-frameworks-and-libraries-to-learn-in-2020-best-of-lot-5f61f86c60b4"&gt;libraries&lt;/a&gt; in the coming days, and there we'll see the benefits and wonders of learning new things, but for now, let's focus on the most essential thing a Web developer should learn in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#which-skills-you-can-learn-to-become-a-frontend-developer-in-2022"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Which skills you can learn to become a frontend developer in 2022?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the essential skills you can learn to become a frontend developer in 2022. The list includes essential technologies, programming languages, tools, libraries, and frameworks. I have also shared resources and online courses to learn these essential frontend development skills. .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This list includes programming languages like JavaScript, markup language like &lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/top-5-free-online-courses-to-learn-html-css-web-development-in-2020-ae8e7466dfa7"&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt;, styling tools like CSS, a framework like &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@javinpaul/top-5-courses-to-learn-react-js-in-2019-best-of-lot-fa02cd96cdf0"&gt;React&lt;/a&gt;, IDE like VSCode, tools like Chrome Developer Tools, NPM, and Webpack, and REST API tools like &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/02/top-5-postman-tutorials-and-courses-for-web-developers.html"&gt;Postman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/05/top-5-courses-to-learn-graphql-in-2019.html"&gt;GraphQL&lt;/a&gt;, a better way to develop APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also included Responsive web design as a skill because, in 2022, it's almost given if you want to serve all of your audience accessing your website or web application using different devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/7-courses-to-learn-web-development-for-beginners-best-of-lot-c91m1325l"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---DercYvy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CjVpN6mUqJg/Xg7YIB1hK9I/AAAAAAAAcSc/D50IUUfx-osQztZa4mIjRxloYd4E8tdhgCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h225/10%252BThings%252BEvery%252BWeb%252BDeveloper%252Bshould%252Blearn.png" alt="best tools, technologies and libraries for web development" width="400" height="225"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-html"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. HTML
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first and foremost thing anyone serious about web development should learn. It's probably the oldest web technology out there and also the first one I learned long ago, but it's still relevant, and you just cannot become a &lt;a href="https://medium.com/hackernoon/the-2019-web-developer-roadmap-ab89ac3c380e"&gt;Web Developer&lt;/a&gt; without a good knowledge of HTML. Technically it's a markup language and used to specify the structure of your page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, it's very rare for anyone to create a web page by writing HTML. Instead, most of the webpage you see is generated by an advanced framework like Angular and React. Still, if you want to understand, debug, and solve problems, you must know essential HTML tags like div, span, title, headers, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you know HTML, there is no harm in updating yourself with the latest development, and if you want to start from scratch, I suggest you join the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Flearn-html5-programming-from-scratch%2F"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn HTML 5 Programming from Scratch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; course on Udemy. It also covers CSS, which we'll discuss next in the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-html-and-css-courses-to-learn-web-development.html"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1f50jFpT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hfQhtplCVHI/Xg7WprCTb5I/AAAAAAAAcSI/XK2zORpqgLA-EINGBPe9JVh2V1lcQzshQCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h225/Learn%252BHTML%252B5%252BProgramming%252Bfrom%252BScratch%252BUdemy%252Bcourse%252Bpreview.jpg" alt="What should a Frontend Developer Learn?" width="400" height="225"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-css-flexbox-and-grid"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. CSS, Flexbox and Grid
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from HTML, if there is another irreplaceable web technology is then it must be CSS 3 or Cascading Style Sheet. CSS is used to style your web page, I mean to make it look more beautiful. You can also use CSS to specify the layout of the element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like HTML, it's scarce now to style your web pages by writing &lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/top-10-free-courses-to-learn-html-5-css-3-and-web-development-872d62d97a97"&gt;CSS&lt;/a&gt; classes by hand, instead of many people and the team using a framework like Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, Materialize, etc. Like HMTL, CSS is also evolving, and now you have things like Flexbox and Grid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it's absolutely essential for any project you work on to look more beautiful, you have to learn CSS. If you are a beginner, I suggest you start with barebone CSS and then move on to these new developments like Flexbox and Grid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need a resource, I recommend &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fadvanced-css-and-sass%2F"&gt;Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations, and More!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Course, which not only covers CSS from scratch but also teaches you Flexbox and Grid, which is going to serve you well in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/javinpaul/these-are-the-best-free-courses-to-learn-html-and-css-for-frontend-developers-2g8g"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dP1PSHaD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WpO0W1Ukq7E/Xg7WL3uXWeI/AAAAAAAAcR0/QwV2ZZLSKPQJY1UiBktaPjMkzvQJyATRwCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/Advanced%252BCSS%252Band%252BSass%252BFlexbox%25252C%252BGrid%25252C%252BAnimations%252Band%252BMore%252BUdemy%252Bcourse.jpeg" alt="10 Skills every Web developer should learn" width="400" height="225"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-javascript"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. JavaScript
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the third most essential thing any Web developer should learn; in fact, without JavaScript, the Web would not have been where it is today. When I learned JavaScript, people told me that it put life in your webpage, it can make your webpage interactive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like you can do things when someone clicks buttons, you can change animations and look and feel of your webpage when the user moves the mouse, etc. All those are still true, but &lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/12-free-courses-to-learn-javascript-and-es6-for-beginners-and-experienced-developers-aa35874c9a32"&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; now offers much more. In fact, you can develop a complete web application end-to-end just using JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has evolved from an essential frontend programming language to a full-stack language, which also allows you to write backend code. This was made possible by &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/01/top-5-nodejs-and-express-js-online-courses-for-web-developers.html"&gt;Nodejs&lt;/a&gt;, another necessary framework for web developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is, JavaScript is absolutely a must for any Web Developer, both frontend and backend, and you should definitely spend some time learning JavaScript in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need a resource, I recommend &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fthe-complete-javascript-course%2F"&gt;The Complete JavaScript 2022: Build Real Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; class by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy, which is a great course to learn JavaScript in depth. It's equally useful for both beginners and experienced Web Developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/06/top-10-courses-to-learn-javascript-in.html"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--icI0ncRP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BTsVFbDr1Lg/Xg7ViYe0ALI/AAAAAAAAcRY/2Y4Spunnn84sOVYYWeHtSIVoZXjSFBNGACLcBGAsYHQ/s400/The%252BComplete%252BJavaScript%252Bcourse%252B2020%252Bpreview%252Budemy%252Bbest%252Bcourse.png" alt="10 things every frontend developer should learn" width="400" height="232"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, JavaScript is still evolving, and now we have things like WebAssembly, which allows you to run code as fast as C, C++, and Rust in your browser.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-reactjs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. React.js
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I have mentioned in the previous paragraph that Web Development, particularly frontend development, has come a long way in the last decade. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you don't need to write &lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/10-best-html-and-css-courses-for-beginners-in-2021-6757eec00032"&gt;HTML and CSS&lt;/a&gt; to create your webpages, like many other web developers and I have done in the late nineties and early 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you have a framework like React, which can dynamically generate web pages for you. That's why a web developer needs to learn a frontend framework like React.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn to React in 2022 and looking for a recommendation, I suggest you join Maximilian's &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Freact-the-complete-guide-incl-redux%2F"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Complete React Guide (with Hooks)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; course, which is the most up-to-date and also covers React Hooks, an essential concept to master in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/04/10-free-angular-and-react-courses-for.html"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_2vu-wxZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MX3JhXG0ncA/Xg7Vb9yegmI/AAAAAAAAcRU/vEBsIgvs9KEcvjxYR57wAgFAjGFNZ3wjQCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/React%252Bthe%252BComplete%252BGuide%252Bwith%252BHooks%252Bcourse%252Bon%252BUdemy%252Bbest%252Bpreview.png" alt="10 Technologies every Web developer should learn" width="400" height="232"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Btw, &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/08/top-5-react-js-and-redux-courses-to-learn-online.html"&gt;React&lt;/a&gt; is not the only one out there, in fact, there are many other frontend frameworks that are as powerful as React like &lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/10-courses-to-learn-angular-for-web-development-6da1bd2856dc"&gt;Angular&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/08/top-5-online-courses-to-learn-vue.js-best.html"&gt;Vuejs&lt;/a&gt;, Svelete.js but I recommend React because it has adopted by many companies, both small and large and I think it is here for a long run.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-responsive-web-design"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Responsive Web Design
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a no-brainer but again an essential thing to learn for Web developers. If you want to develop a website or web application, it must be responsive to cater to your audiences and customers accessing your site from different devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responsive web design allows you to best present your website depending upon the size of the tools your users are using. I have seen many frontend developers not paying attention to this essential skill, don't be one of them, and learn Responsive web design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most likely, it will be handled for you by a framework, but knowing how it works is essential to troubleshoot and maintain your web project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn Responsive Web design in 2022, I suggest you take a look at Jonas Schmedtmann's  &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fdesign-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3%2F"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; course on Udemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/better-programming/my-5-favorite-courses-to-learn-web-development-in-2019-a5e74167f8b2"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QQ-R8Fm_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Pub9MgtFuWE/Xg7UPb48QKI/AAAAAAAAcQk/CvCr-LJRhGEZj-taCOcAz5u4W-Uc0gg2gCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/Build%252BResponsive%252BReal%252BWorld%252BWebsites%252Bwith%252BHTML5%252Band%252BCSS3%252BUdemy%252Bcourse.png" alt="best course to learn Responsive web design" width="400" height="225"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-npm-node-package-manager"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. NPM (Node Package Manager)
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have covered the most essential programming language and framework for &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/08/top-5-online-training-courses-to-learn-frontend-web-development.html"&gt;frontend development&lt;/a&gt;, it's time to look at essential tools or web development, and first, one of them is NPM. If you don't know, now you don't need to write code for everything you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if you want to generate dynamic web pages, you don't need to write a framework, someone else has already written, and you can just import them to use in your project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this was made possible because of NPM or Node Package Manager. It's the world's biggest software registry and hosts more than 800,000 code packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically, NPM is a package manager of the JavaScript programming language. It is also the default package manager of Node.js, which provides a JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It consists of a command-line client called npm for downloading those modules and also hosts both public and private packages online. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You generally learn about NPM when you learn nodejs, but even if you don't know node, you should learn NPM. If you need a resource, I recommend Andrea Mead and Rob Percival's &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fthe-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2%2F"&gt;The Complete Node.js Developer Course&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on Udemy, one of my favorite courses to learn Nodejs from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/01/top-5-nodejs-and-express-js-online-courses-for-web-developers.html"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Wggv0PBS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-M1N0Q3kySwU/Xg7U-HKUXII/AAAAAAAAcRA/g4MHPLvQbvUb5mZf3vC1rLZmT9TWYDCrACLcBGAsYHQ/s400/The%252BComplete%252BNode%252BJS%252Bdeveloper%252Budemy%252Bcourse.jpg" alt="10 Frameworks every Web developer should learn" width="400" height="225"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#7-vscode"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  7. VSCode
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to code, the IDE is your most important tool, and as a Java developer, I always feel lucky that we have not one but three top-class IDE - &lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/top-10-courses-to-learn-eclipse-junit-and-mockito-for-java-developers-4de1e8d62b96"&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt;, NetBeans, and &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/09/top-5-courses-to-learn-intellij-idea-java-and-android-development.html#axzz6A8Vy1sea"&gt;IntelliJIDEA&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long, when I do web development, I think we don't have any tools which can compete with IDEs like these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No doubt that you can use them for web development, too, but it makes more sense for Web developers who use Java in the backend. Microsoft VSCode changed that thing and has come along as the most potent IDE or Editor for Web Development. Compared to those fat IDEs, VSCode is also very lightweight and highly configurable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have plugins for almost anything from developing frontend to connecting to a cloud-like &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/05/top-5-courses-to-crack-aws-solutions-architect-associate-certification-exam-SAA-C01.html#axzz5rHwAwycj"&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/07/top-5-courses-to-crack-azure-architecture-technologies-certification-az-300-exam.html"&gt;Azure&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/07/top-5-google-cloud-platform-gcp-courses-certifications-online.html"&gt;GCP&lt;/a&gt; and deploying your application. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to become a proficient Web Developer in 2022, I suggest you learn VSCode in 2022, and if you already know, just learn more like shortcuts, new extensions, etc. If you need a resource, then John Papa's &lt;a href="https://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1193463/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Fcourses%2Fvisual-studio-code"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Visual Studio Code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; course on Pluralsight is the best one to start with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#8-chrome-developer-tools"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  8. Chrome Developer Tools
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another essential tool for Web Developers, particularly frontend developers. For a long time, I relied on the View Page Source option of Internet Explorer to figure out what's going on on a particular web page, it's an old story, but things have changed ever since Chrome took the market by storm in the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, almost 70% Web is browsed using Chrome. Many web developers don't know that Chrome has a built-in debugging tool, know as Chrome Developer Tool. You can access this by right-clicking and clicking on "Inspect."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tool not only allows you to see raw HTML but also CSS, JavaScript libraries, and much more. You can even change the CSS classes on the fly and play with look and feel. I strongly recommend you to learn this tool in-depth, and if you need a resource, I recommend &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fmaster-google-chrome-developer-tools%2F"&gt;D*&lt;em&gt;evTools Pro: Beginners to Expert&lt;/em&gt;*&lt;/a&gt; course on Udemy. It's a good beginner-level course to start with the Chrome Developer tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-2019-web-developer-roadmap-ab89ac3c380e"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Srk_Ke0c--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-L3b_2VQb9mQ/Xg7UkMo7bOI/AAAAAAAAcQw/UVa7or2htkM4EMZRm_tWPiMgDREW16gagCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/Chrome%252BDeveloper%252Btool%252Bcourse%252Bon%252BUdemy%252Bbest.jpg" alt="Tools every Web developer should learn" width="400" height="266"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#9-postman"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  9. Postman
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another absolutely must-know tool for Web Developers. Since today's Web world is a Web of APIs, you need a tool that can help you to explore APIs, and there is no better tool than Postman for interacting with APIs. You can use Postman to send HTTP requests, access APIs, check their response header, and do much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn't matter if you connect to internal API or external APIs offered by Google, Facebook, Amazon, and many other payment gateways, Postman is essential for exploring and understanding them. It's also an excellent tool to test your own APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get Postman as a Chrome extension or a desktop client. Again, I strongly recommend you to learn Postman if you need a resource check out this &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fpostman-the-complete-guide%2F"&gt;Postman Complete Guide: REST API Testing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; course by Valentin Despa on Udemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/javinpaul/top-6-courses-to-learn-web-development-best-of-lot-2fae"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--G1WLgCpj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wVxnIlt9tSk/Xg6pygg8KRI/AAAAAAAAcPY/jtaQbu0D16Ih0lKLf7cPH9cWjJTs9pWuQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/Postman%252Bto%252Btest%252BRESTful%252Bweb%252BServcie%252Bin%252BJava.png" alt="best course to learn Postman tool for API testing" width="320" height="223"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#10-graphql"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  10. GraphQL
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you know, most of the Web is driven by APIs, mainly REST APIs. One of the crucial jobs for a web developer is to either develop APIS as a backend developer or consumer those APIs as a frontend developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both cases, you need to know how to interact with them. While &lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/top-5-books-and-courses-to-learn-restful-web-services-in-java-using-spring-mvc-and-spring-boot-79ec4b351d12"&gt;REST&lt;/a&gt; is an easy and accessible way for developing APIS, it has some shortcomings for any practical web application like too many end-points to maintain and unwanted data to download and process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GraphQL addresses that problem, and it's already powering the next level of APIs development. If you want to stay ahead of the curve, I recommend you to learn GraphQL in 2022, and if you need a resource, I suggest you take a look at the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fgraphql-with-react-course%2F"&gt;GraphQL with React: The Complete Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; course by none other than Stephen Grider, one of Udemy's best instructor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/top-5-graphql-courses-for-beginners-26cad52bcd3e"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BZqX7K-l--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ljf0ePoLguo/Xg6psHsTWGI/AAAAAAAAcPU/z5UbUsEa6cgCNulxy8aE4ywFPIoE2xqVgCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/Complete%252Bguide%252Bto%252Bbuilding%252Ba%252BGraphQL%252BAPI%252BUdemy%252BCourse.png" alt="should web developer learn GraphQL" width="400" height="225"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's all about &lt;strong&gt;how to become a frontend developer in 2022&lt;/strong&gt;. These are the essential technologies for any web developer, but particularly frontend developers. There is a good chance that you already be familiar with many of these technologies like the big three of web development - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, they keep evolving like CSS now have FlexBox and Grid, JavaScript has ES6 and WebAssembly, etc. Spending some time keeping yourself up-to-date will go a long way in becoming a better web developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, I have tried to mention the most essential things, but as a Web developer, you also need to learn a lot. I don't want to overwhelm you, but things like HTTP, SSL, Certificates are also essential. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're going to in more detail, I also recommend you check the following Web Developer RoadMap, which includes a lot more things a Web Developer should learn.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Emmet Crash Course!</title>
      <author>Ustariz Enzo</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Nov 2021 08:25:29 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/ziratsu/emmet-crash-course-gjm</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/ziratsu/emmet-crash-course-gjm</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey &lt;strong&gt;fellow creators&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's boost your productivity with &lt;strong&gt;Emmet&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally, Emmet was an extension that's become so popular it's now been integrated into VS Code and other code editors. It's simply a shortcut extension that's very useful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's learn the most useful shortcuts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you prefer to watch the video &lt;strong&gt;version&lt;/strong&gt;, it's right here :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OJgrYe4WYRs"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-create-a-div-with-a-class"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Create a div with a class.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first and most used shortcut will be the dot. It will allow you to create a div with a class quickly. For instance, write &lt;em&gt;.box&lt;/em&gt; and then press tab/enter on your keyboard, this will create the following line of code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;.box&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"box"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By default, it will assume that you want a &lt;em&gt;div&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
You can also write &lt;em&gt;div.box&lt;/em&gt; and then press tab/enter, which will do the same thing. But that means that you can also create another tag with a class, for instance &lt;em&gt;li.box&lt;/em&gt; will create:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;li.box&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"box"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can also create a div with multiple classes by writing for instance &lt;em&gt;div.box.square.circle&lt;/em&gt; and then pressing tab/enter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;div.box.square.circle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"box square circle"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-create-a-div-with-an-id"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Create a div with an ID.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way to create a div with an ID with Emmet is pretty similar, instead of a dot you simply need to use a hashtag. So write &lt;em&gt;#myElement&lt;/em&gt; and press tab/enter and the following div will be created:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;#myElement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"myElement"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can also mix the class and the id by writing for instance :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;div#id.box&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"id"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"box"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-how-to-create-multiple-divs-at-the-same-time"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. How to create multiple divs at the same time?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to create a div with the same classname multiple times quicker than before, you can simply write &lt;em&gt;.box*6&lt;/em&gt; for instance, which will create six divs with the class name "box":&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;.box*6&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"box"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"box"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"box"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"box"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"box"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"box"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-you-can-add-some-text-content"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. You can add some text content!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you already know what your tag's content will be, you can simply write it in between curly braces, for instance writing &lt;em&gt;h1{Hello World}&lt;/em&gt; and pressing tab/enter will create:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;h1{Hello World}&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Hello World&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-get-the-index"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Get the index.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to have an index, you can type &lt;em&gt;h1{$}*6&lt;/em&gt;  and press tab/enter, which will create:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;h1{$}*6&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;1&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;2&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;3&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;4&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;5&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;6&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-play-with-the-index-in-your-classes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. Play with the index in your classes!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By typing &lt;em&gt;p.txt-${$}*6&lt;/em&gt; and pressing tab/enter, you'll create an index with the same class:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;p.txt-${$}*6&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"txt-1"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;1&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"txt-2"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;2&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"txt-3"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;3&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"txt-4"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;4&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"txt-5"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;5&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"txt-6"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;6&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The dollar symbol will symbolise the index every time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#7-create-nested-elements"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  7. Create nested elements.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write &lt;em&gt;.parent&amp;gt;.child&lt;/em&gt; and press tab/enter to create nested elements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;.parent&amp;gt;.child&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"parent"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"child"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is very useful when you want to create a list or a form for example!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's create a complex nested example together. Let's say you want to create a container with a &lt;em&gt;ul&lt;/em&gt; list within which you'll have six &lt;em&gt;li&lt;/em&gt; elements, all of which will have the same class name. Try it yourself first!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"container"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;ul&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"list"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"item"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"item"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"item"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"item"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"item"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"item"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here's the solution: type &lt;em&gt;.container&amp;gt;ul.list&amp;gt;li.item*6&lt;/em&gt; and press tab/enter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#8-create-something-at-the-same-level-instead-of-nested"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  8. Create something at the same level (instead of nested).
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the + sign to create two divs at the same level: &lt;em&gt;.box1+.box2&lt;/em&gt; will create:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;.box1+.box2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"box1"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"box2"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#9-go-one-level-up"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  9. Go one level up!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's useful if you want to create a nested element followed by a simple div for instance. In order to do that, you need to use ^, like so: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;.container&amp;gt;child^.container2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"container"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"child"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"container2"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#10-you-can-also-group-things-up"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  10. You can also group things up!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's imagine that inside of your container you want a list with li elements, but then you want to go up with a paragraph. You can therefore do it like this: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;.container&amp;gt;(ul&amp;gt;li*6)^p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"container"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#11-create-a-full-doctype-quickly"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  11.  Create a full doctype quickly!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a doctype very quickly, you just need one key and that's an exclamation point! Type &lt;em&gt;!&lt;/em&gt; and then press tab/enter and voila!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;!&lt;/em&gt; + tab/enter&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;html&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;lang=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"en"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;charset=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"UTF-8"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;http-equiv=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"X-UA-Compatible"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"IE=edge"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"viewport"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Document&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#12-create-any-element-with-its-name"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  12. Create any element with its name!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can simply write an element's name and then press tab/enter and it'll create said element.&lt;br&gt;
Some elements even come with attributes, that you can then change however you need. For instance, by typing &lt;em&gt;input&lt;/em&gt; and pressing tab/enter, you'll have the following code:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"text"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The same goes for &lt;em&gt;textarea&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;form&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;img&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;, etc.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;textarea&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;cols=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"30"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;rows=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"10"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/textarea&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;action=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;alt=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you can see you'll now be able to gain many precious seconds in your coding time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the full &lt;a href="https://github.com/Ziratsu/Emmet-Crash-Course"&gt;crash course&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come and take a look at my &lt;strong&gt;Youtube channel&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Learntocreate/videos"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/c/Learntocreate/videos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;See you soon!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enzo. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Supercharge Your Node Productivity With Debugging</title>
      <author>Robbie Cahill</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Nov 2021 08:18:21 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/ciphercode/debug-a-nodejs-express-app-with-vscode-2bh2</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/ciphercode/debug-a-nodejs-express-app-with-vscode-2bh2</guid>
      <description>&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will show you how to debug a NodeJS express app using Visual Studio Code. You don't need to be a node expert to do debugging, beginner level knowledge is all thats required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-you-should-use-a-real-debugger-instead-of-raw-consolelog-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why you should use a real debugger instead of &lt;code&gt;console.log()&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back when I was a mid level engineer at Symantec, learning how to use a debugger supercharged my productivity. I could do in a couple of hours work that might have taken me a day to do. Fixing bugs and building out features was much easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've found debugging especially useful when exploring unfamiliar codebases that I didn't write. You can easily see the results of even the most complex logic written in weird ways. Its much easier to reason out complex, convoluted logic when you can run it line by line and see how things change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you've ever used &lt;code&gt;console.log()&lt;/code&gt; to print a value to the console, you might know how tedious it can get if you are trying to debug something complex. It prints one value at a time and you need to write a new &lt;code&gt;console.log()&lt;/code&gt; statement for each value you want to see. If the value you are looking at changes, you need to &lt;code&gt;console.log()&lt;/code&gt; it again. Its a bit like poking around with a blindfold or in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this is necessary with a real debugger. Set a breakpoint in your code then run your app. When your app reaches the line you set a breakpoint on, you'll be able to see all variables in scope in the debug tab. With just one action, you can now see everything instead of just one value at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with just debugging my own application code but as time went by and I became more senior, I found I could get great insights by debugging framework code (such as the code for &lt;code&gt;express&lt;/code&gt; itself). I was able to find answers to questions that weren't even listed in the documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prerequisites"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Prerequisites
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll need to have both &lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com"&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://nodejs.org"&gt;NodeJS&lt;/a&gt; installed for this guide. If you want to run and debug your app with a public URL instead of just &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt;, you'll also need &lt;a href="https://expose.sh/install?utm_source=expose.sh&amp;amp;utm_campaign=debugNodeExpressVscode"&gt;expose.sh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#example-express-app"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Example express app
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend using my express example app, the entire code is shown below&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// app.js&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;port&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;baz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;one&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;two&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;three&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;five&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;two&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;three&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;send&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;2 + 3 = &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;five&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Example app listening at http://localhost:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Create a new folder somewhere on your device, then copy and paste this code into a file with the name &lt;code&gt;app.js&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set up your project with &lt;code&gt;npm init&lt;/code&gt;, then follow the prompts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then run &lt;code&gt;npm install --save express&lt;/code&gt; to install the &lt;code&gt;express&lt;/code&gt; dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can run the code with &lt;code&gt;node app.js&lt;/code&gt;. Hit &lt;a href="http://localhost:3000"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://localhost:3000"&gt;http://localhost:3000&lt;/a&gt; in your browser and you'll immediately see this code has a bug because the output is not correct.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--aL9xY8mz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://expose.sh/blog/learn-how-to-debug-node-express-with-vscode/wrong-output.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--aL9xY8mz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://expose.sh/blog/learn-how-to-debug-node-express-with-vscode/wrong-output.png" alt="wrong output" width="553" height="279"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don't fix it yet. You could look at the numbers and work out in your mind what the problem is. Instead, we'll use debugging to make it very easy to spot the problem, saving your brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start with, you'll need to set up Visual Studio Code (vscode), an open source IDE from Microsoft. If you don't yet have it, grab a free copy from &lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com"&gt;code.visualstudio.com&lt;/a&gt;. There are versions for Linux, Mac and Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#set-up-vscode"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Set up vscode
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VSCode is one of the easiest IDEs out there to set up debugging for, because its controlled by a simple config file. This means you can just copy and paste the config from a guide like this one, without needing to set it up manually or click lots of settings like you might need to do with other IDEs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a folder with the name &lt;code&gt;.vscode&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then create the file &lt;code&gt;.vscode/launch.json&lt;/code&gt; and paste in these contents:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// .vscode/launch.json&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;0.2.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;configurations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Launch Express App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;program&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;${workspaceFolder}/app.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;launch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;skipFiles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;lt;node_internals&amp;gt;/**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;pwa-node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#set-a-breakpoint"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Set a breakpoint
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A breakpoint is a place you set in your code where you want your application to pause, so you can inspect local variables and the general state of your app. In vscode, a breakpoint represented by a red dot to the left of the line number you want your app to pause on. Breakpoints are set by simply clicking the area to the left of the line number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see that some numbers have been added incorrectly, so set a breakpoint on the &lt;code&gt;res.send('2 + 3 = ' + five)&lt;/code&gt; line, by clicking on the area to the left of the line number. A red dot should appear where you clicked, like the one on line 14 below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RS6EHmFi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://expose.sh/blog/learn-how-to-debug-node-express-with-vscode/breakpoint.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RS6EHmFi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://expose.sh/blog/learn-how-to-debug-node-express-with-vscode/breakpoint.png" alt="breakpoint" width="652" height="418"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to get to the bottom of why the value of &lt;code&gt;five&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt; and not &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt;, like it should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#start-your-app-with-debugging"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Start your app with debugging
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on the debug icon at the left of the vscode window to open the "Run and debug" pane. It looks like this: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NRgDA3q4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://expose.sh/blog/learn-how-to-debug-node-express-with-vscode/debug-pane.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NRgDA3q4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://expose.sh/blog/learn-how-to-debug-node-express-with-vscode/debug-pane.png" alt="debug pane" width="47" height="52"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll see this at the top of the left pane: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bXSWK58V--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://expose.sh/blog/learn-how-to-debug-node-express-with-vscode/launch-express-app.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bXSWK58V--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://expose.sh/blog/learn-how-to-debug-node-express-with-vscode/launch-express-app.png" alt="launch express app" width="171" height="23"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click that little green arrow icon to the left of "Launch Express App".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your express app will now launch inside vscode with full debugging support. In the "Debug Console" pane at the bottom of the vscode window you'll see it start up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TmiH_2Sd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://expose.sh/blog/learn-how-to-debug-node-express-with-vscode/debug-console.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TmiH_2Sd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://expose.sh/blog/learn-how-to-debug-node-express-with-vscode/debug-console.png" alt="debug console" width="357" height="81"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app is now being run within vscode with debugging support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#trigger-your-breakpoint"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Trigger your breakpoint
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the app running in vscode, go to &lt;a href="http://localhost:3000"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://localhost:3000"&gt;http://localhost:3000&lt;/a&gt; in your browser (or just click that link).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The breakpoint will then be hit. It will look like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lGbzo3Yc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://expose.sh/blog/learn-how-to-debug-node-express-with-vscode/breakpoint-hit.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lGbzo3Yc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://expose.sh/blog/learn-how-to-debug-node-express-with-vscode/breakpoint-hit.png" alt="breakpoint hit" width="743" height="438"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few things going on here, so lets explain below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the left under &lt;code&gt;RUN AND DEBUG&lt;/code&gt; you'll see the list of local variables. &lt;code&gt;req&lt;/code&gt; is the express &lt;code&gt;request&lt;/code&gt; object, &lt;code&gt;res&lt;/code&gt; is the express &lt;code&gt;response&lt;/code&gt; object. These are useful to look at if you want to see query parameters and data posted to your app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see all local variables and their values in scope at the line your breakpoint is on. To see all of this information using &lt;code&gt;console.log()&lt;/code&gt; you would have to log each variable one by one. With the debugger and a breakpoint you can see everything instantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above the &lt;code&gt;res.send&lt;/code&gt; line, i've done some basic arithmetic. You'll see the results of this in the list of local variables. For example the value of &lt;code&gt;two&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now look at the value of &lt;code&gt;three&lt;/code&gt;. Clearly, it should be &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt; not &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;, so there is the bug. Update the value of &lt;code&gt;three&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt;, then stop and restart the application and the output will be correct.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gCMgdahD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://expose.sh/blog/learn-how-to-debug-node-express-with-vscode/correct-output.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gCMgdahD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://expose.sh/blog/learn-how-to-debug-node-express-with-vscode/correct-output.png" alt="correct output" width="542" height="273"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#debug-with-a-public-url"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Debug with a Public URL
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You've learned to debug with a &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt; URL, only accessible from your computer. Using &lt;code&gt;expose&lt;/code&gt;, with a single terminal command you can give your locally running express app a public HTTPS URL which you can share with others. All traffic to this public URL will be automatically routed to &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt; through a secure tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would you want to do this? Lets say you are building an API for an app and you are working with a front end (e.g. React) developer who will integrate with your API. This is a very common use case for &lt;code&gt;express&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could set a breakpoint, then ask the React developer to trigger his app to call your API. You can then inspect the request and update your API to handle it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other uses are Webhooks. If you ever have to do a webhook integration, you can configure your public URL with the webhook provider and trigger them to make a request to your locally running app, which you are debugging in vscode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now see exactly what your webhook provider is sending and you didn't even need to read (or even understand) their documentation. Now you know exactly what code to write to make use of that request. Regardless of how good or bad their documentation is, you now know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To install &lt;code&gt;expose&lt;/code&gt;, go to the &lt;a href="https://expose.sh/install?utm_source=expose.sh&amp;amp;utm_campaign=debugNodeExpressVscode"&gt;Installation Page&lt;/a&gt; and follow the instructions shown. Its a copy and paste install for Linux and Mac. A downloadable &lt;code&gt;exe&lt;/code&gt; is available for Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;expose 3000&lt;/code&gt; and you should see output like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ expose 3000
http://mofgjp.expose.sh is forwarding to localhost:3000
https://mofgjp.expose.sh is forwarding to localhost:3000
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now with the breakpoint still set and your app running in vscode, go to the HTTPS URL shown in your browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The breakpoint will be hit as if you have just made the request to &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt;. If you want to get fancy, try hitting this URL from another computer or your phone and the breakpoint will still be hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now share this URL with other developers you are integrating with, webhook providers and other people you want to share it with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#using-the-debug-console"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Using the debug console
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice little feature of the vscode debugger is the debug console. It opens up at the bottom of the window when you start debugging inside a pane with the title &lt;code&gt;DEBUG CONSOLE&lt;/code&gt;. If you've ever used the console inside devtools for your favorite web browser, this is pretty much the same thing but for back end NodeJS code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you might want to try out an expression without modifying your code. In the debug console, try typing in &lt;code&gt;one + three&lt;/code&gt;. The result &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt; will appear in the console:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GzKiE_fZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://expose.sh/blog/learn-how-to-debug-node-express-with-vscode/one-plus-three.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GzKiE_fZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://expose.sh/blog/learn-how-to-debug-node-express-with-vscode/one-plus-three.png" alt="one plus three" width="360" height="192"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can run any JavaScript code inside the debug console. You can also run functions. Lets say a function you are calling is not doing what you expected it to do. You could try running it with different parameters inside the debug console until you get it to behave how you want, then update your code accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-to-the-next-line"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step to the next line
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set a new breakpoint at the line &lt;code&gt;const foo = "bar"&lt;/code&gt;. Launch your express app in vscode, then hit the URL in your browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The breakpoint will be hit. A useful feature of the debugger is the ability to run to the next line, so you can effectively run your app line by line.&lt;/p&gt;

  Conclusion
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debugging can supercharge your productivity as a NodeJS developer. You'll be able to fix bugs faster and spend way less time figuring out unfamiliar code. Instead of logging values one by one with &lt;code&gt;console.log&lt;/code&gt;, with debugging you can now see everything at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you learn debugging, you'll never need to use &lt;code&gt;console.log&lt;/code&gt; for debugging again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Coding!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>7 tips for the newbie freelancers</title>
      <author>Pasca Vlad</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Nov 2021 08:02:39 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/pascavld/7-tips-for-the-newbie-freelancers-hde</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/pascavld/7-tips-for-the-newbie-freelancers-hde</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you found value in this thread you will most likely enjoy my tweets too so make sure you follow me on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VladPasca5"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;  for more information about web development and how to improve as a developer. This article was first published on my &lt;a href="https://vladpasca.hashnode.dev/"&gt;Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you want to become a freelancer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone wants to do that now&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But no one knows how to begin and how to do it the right way&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of things I wish I knew earlier when I first started my journey&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are 7 tips for the newbie freelancers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a mentor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is key when you're just starting out&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a good mentor can save you 6 months of research if used the right way&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal is to find someone who is just a few steps ahead of you and learn from them&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When looking for a mentor, create a connection first&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't DM someone and ask them to be your mentor right away&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not how you get a mentor&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And be willing to spend money on this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outreach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the action that gets your clients&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this at the same time the most important action in the beginning&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't do outreach you don't get clients&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn how to do it the right way read this thread&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VladPasca5/status/1460947838729428992?s=20"&gt;https://twitter.com/VladPasca5/status/1460947838729428992?s=20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work for free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the best things you can do when you first start freelancing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because let's face it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have no social proof&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No past work&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And no one knows you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can't expect someone to hire you if you have no experience&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why working for free is...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the best strategies you can use in the beginning&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a strategy I'm using (and used) and it works like wonders&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn more about it read this thread&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VladPasca5/status/1450801786261020674?s=20"&gt;https://twitter.com/VladPasca5/status/1450801786261020674?s=20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on the things that matter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most overlooked things when you're first starting out&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone is focusing on creating the perfect portfolio, or the perfect offer, or the perfect outreach script&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in reality, this won't get you more clients&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(at least in the beginning)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What will get you clients in the beginning is outreach&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why you need to create everything as fast as you can and start doing outreach as soon as possible&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will tha&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a portfolio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I said that focusing on building a perfect portfolio in the beginning is bad, you still need to have a portfolio&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because you need to have a place where you can show your past work and your testimonials&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you create a portfolio you can...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;just redirect all of your potential clients there&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where they can see your:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Past work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social proof&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they will be more likely to hire you after that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the SEO benefit is huge&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can literally get clients through SEO without doing anything&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join a private community of freelancers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing that helped me a lot in the beginning&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you join a community of freelancers you get access to people who are a lot more experienced with you and who can always help you out&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this will save you a lot of time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The price that you'll pay for that community is nothing compared to the time it saves you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The community I joined is Utopia and it quickly became my go-to resource&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in joining too, click the link below&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gumroad.com/a/830624883/vHMYE"&gt;https://gumroad.com/a/830624883/vHMYE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay consistent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might not see results in the first few months&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that is ok, especially if you're working for free&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your goal in the beginning is to get as much social proof as possible&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your goal is to get results for your clients you will win in the long term&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I hope found this useful and if you did please let me know. If you have any questions feel free to DM me on  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VladPasca5"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Python String Methods for Whitespace Removal </title>
      <author>Bala Priya C</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Nov 2021 07:44:33 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/balapriya/python-string-methods-for-whitespace-removal-57da</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/balapriya/python-string-methods-for-whitespace-removal-57da</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When working with Python strings, there are times when you'll need to remove unwanted whitespaces, tabs, and newline characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have to resize strings, or ensure consistency for further processing - such as processing text collected through forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Python's string methods for whitespace removal return strings with all unwanted whitespaces, and tabs removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📑&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: I'll use the term whitespaces going forward - whitespaces, tabs, and newlines have all been subsumed in this term 'whitespaces'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, you'll learn how you can remove leading, trailing, and both leading and trailing whitespaces using the built-in string methods, &lt;code&gt;lstrip()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;rstrip()&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;strip()&lt;/code&gt;, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-use-raw-lstrip-endraw-to-remove-leading-whitespaces-in-python-strings"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to Use &lt;code&gt;lstrip()&lt;/code&gt; to Remove Leading Whitespaces in Python Strings
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the &lt;code&gt;lstrip()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;.lstrip()&lt;/code&gt; returns a copy of the string with all leading whitespaces removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;lstrip()&lt;/code&gt; stands for left. So this method removes all whitespaces to the left of the first character in the string.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore it removes leading whitespaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;▶ Here's an example.&lt;br&gt;
Consider the string &lt;code&gt;"    Coding is hard, yet fun!\t"&lt;/code&gt;  - it has 4 leading whitespaces, and 1 trailing tab (&lt;code&gt;\t&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, call the &lt;code&gt;lstrip()&lt;/code&gt; method on this string. And store the returned string in the variable &lt;code&gt;l_str&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;long_str&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"    Coding is hard, yet fun!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;l_str&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;long_str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lstrip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's print out the lengths of the original string &lt;code&gt;long_str&lt;/code&gt;, and the returned string &lt;code&gt;l_str&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;long_str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;l_str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Output
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;29&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the lengths, the 4 leading whitespaces have been removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-use-raw-rstrip-endraw-to-remove-trailing-whitespaces-in-python-strings"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to Use &lt;code&gt;rstrip()&lt;/code&gt; to Remove Trailing Whitespaces in Python Strings
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's now look at the &lt;code&gt;rstrip()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;.rstrip()&lt;/code&gt; returns a copy of the string with all trailing whitespaces removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;rstrip()&lt;/code&gt; stands for right. So this method removes all whitespaces to the right of the last character in the string.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore it removes trailing whitespaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;▶ Let's use the same example string from the previous section. And call the &lt;code&gt;rstrip()&lt;/code&gt; method on this string, store the returned string in the variable &lt;code&gt;r_str&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;long_str&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"    Coding is hard, yet fun!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;r_str&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;long_str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;rstrip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;long_str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;r_str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Output
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;29&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;28&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the trailing tab &lt;code&gt;\t&lt;/code&gt; has been removed. And the returned string's length is one less than the original string, as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-use-raw-strip-endraw-to-remove-leading-and-trailing-whitespaces-in-python-strings"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to Use &lt;code&gt;strip()&lt;/code&gt; to Remove Leading and Trailing Whitespaces in Python Strings
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you know how to remove leading and trailing whitespaces using &lt;code&gt;lstrip()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;rstrip()&lt;/code&gt; respectively, in this section, you'll learn how &lt;code&gt;strip()&lt;/code&gt; method helps remove both leading and trailing whitespaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;.strip()&lt;/code&gt; returns a copy of the string with all leading and trailing whitespaces removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;▶ As with the earlier sections, let's call the &lt;code&gt;strip()&lt;/code&gt; method on the string &lt;code&gt;long_str&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;long_str&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"    Coding is hard, yet fun!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;s_str&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;long_str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;strip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;long_str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s_str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Output
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;29&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From the length of the returned string, you can see that both the 4 leading whitespaces, and the trailing &lt;code&gt;\t&lt;/code&gt; have been removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you found this short tutorial on string methods helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The table below summarizes what you've learned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Method&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;lstrip()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Returns a copy of the string with all leading whitespaces removed&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;rstrip()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Returns a copy of the string with all trailing whitespaces removed&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;strip()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Returns a copy of the string with all leading and trailing whitespaces removed&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy learning and coding!😄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Salesforce consultant should be able to explain how often you need updates. This will give you an idea of what to expect from them. It is important to note that you should choose a Salesforce consultant willing to commit to ongoing support. While the initial implementation period can last a long time, you should always have someone on-call to help with the ongoing maintenance. As long as you can communicate with them, you can trust them with your business's most sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When choosing a Salesforce partner, it is essential to know your business goals. Your business's objectives will determine the type of services you need and the features you need. If you're a customer-focused company, your consulting partner will identify your needs and then help you choose the right Salesforce edition to meet your needs. Once you've chosen your Salesforce partner, you'll be able to enjoy many benefits that your customers will appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Salesforce review center has over 1 million reviews of Salesforce consulting services. If you'd like to find a reliable partner, you can check out the company's profile in AppExchange. These profiles will give you details about the number of projects the consultant has completed and how many people have reviewed the services. If you're unsure about the right partner, you can always contact the review center to discuss your needs. A trusted and experienced consultant will make it easier for you to navigate the program and make it more effective for you to do your job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A professional Salesforce consulting team will not only offer you a customized solution for your business's needs, but they will also provide recommendations for compatible software for your business. As a result, using a CRM system will improve your company's performance and reduce operational costs. Additionally, a &lt;a href="https://salesforce.com"&gt;CRM platform&lt;/a&gt; can help you integrate your online and offline channels seamlessly. In addition to these advantages, it can also improve your business's mobile responsiveness and boost sales. These are all benefits of a Salesforce consultant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When hiring a Salesforce consulting firm, you must consider several factors. The firm's location is an essential consideration because the prices of these services are directly related to the consultant's expertise. Therefore, the rate of a Salesforce consulting company will depend on the location of the firm. The seniority of the team members is an essential factor that will determine the cost of the project. If you hire a company with a high level of experience, the rates will be lower than those of newcomers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Top 6 best android games 2021</title>
      <author>Slope Unblocked Games</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Nov 2021 07:32:13 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/slopegameonl/top-10-best-android-games-2021-1c75</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Android games have become a more feasible alternative to handheld console games. Every day, a large number of mobile games are added to the Google Play store. Smartphones are the most convenient way for kids and adults to play internet games. Here is top 10 best Android games to look forward to in 2021, thanks to Google Play's variety of multi-genre games that never cease to astound consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--oTiKuHeN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cwwnwwchhjp7bjcp80qk.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--oTiKuHeN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cwwnwwchhjp7bjcp80qk.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;League of Legends: Wild Rift&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;League of Legends: Wild Rift is now available in regional beta across Asia, with a worldwide release scheduled in early 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wild Rift is a mobile version of League of Legends' basic MOBA gameplay, including many of the same characters and game features. Overall, mobile matches are substantially shorter, with the typical game lasting around 15 minutes against the 45-minute bouts that might occur on a PC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of the great response to the beta version, Riot Games continues to make incremental tweaks based on beta input before the official global launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pokemon Unite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pokemon Unite is set to be published in early 2021 and will feature MOBA-style gameplay. In a MOBA-style arena, two teams of five players will compete for points by collecting wild Pokemon scattered throughout the map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might be a one-of-a-kind gameplay experience in the Pokemon universe, combining MOBA elements with the Pokemon universe. If you can't wait to try Pokemon Unite, you may play Pokemon-themed.io games like Pokemon Mega and Pokemon Tower Defense online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tencent will publish the game, which TiMi Studios will produce. This is the first time a Chinese gaming business has been allowed to work on a Pokemon game, despite Nintendo's indicated interest in partnering with a Chinese company to make Pokemon games as far back as 2004.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diablo III, developed by Blizzard Entertainment, is one of the most popular PC ARPG games, having sold over 12 million copies since its debut in 2012. Fans have long been demanding a sequel, but Blizzard has focused on releasing a mobile game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, rather than being a real plot sequel, Diablo Immortal will be set between Diablo 2 and Diablo 3. The gameplay will be highly similar to the Diablo series' loot-and-grind mechanics and include MMO features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Blizzard, Diablo Immortal is expected to be released in 2021, followed by Diablo 4 for PC in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dawn Awakening&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Tencent's Dawn Awakening is a long-awaited open-world zombie survival game developed by the same team behind PUBG Mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's based on the Unreal four-engine, and the studio believes it'll deliver a console-like gaming experience on mobile devices. Many players are also likely to use Android emulators to play on PC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supply looting, base building, and a dynamic weather system will play a big part in the game. The exact rules of the game are yet unknown. However, beta gameplay footage depicts a game that looks like PUBG Mobile but is set in a zombie-infested setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plants Vs Zombie 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early in 2020, EA and Popcap Games released a pre-alpha version of Plants vs. Zombies 3 with restricted downloads. They also did a limited soft launch in select areas. However, it is no longer available on the Google Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because EA and Popcap Games haven't said anything about the game being canceled, it's extremely probable that they're polishing it based on pre-alpha feedback and will rerelease it in 2021. It's unclear whether this is an official release or another round of beta testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Path of Exile Mobile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2013, Path of Exile has catered to a small community of hardcore loot-and-grinders, while Diablo 3 reigns dominant in the mainstream ARPG market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, two different Path of Exile releases may be released in 2021. Path of Exile Mobile will be the first, according to Grinding Gear Games, because the endgame Atlas mapping system in PoE works wonderfully on touchscreen devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second could be a real-life PC sequel called Path of Exile 2, which GGG has claimed will begin beta testing in late 2020 or early 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Faster! Optimizing React app to the bone</title>
      <author>Štěpán Granát</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Nov 2021 06:54:55 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/tolgee_i18n/faster-optimizing-react-app-to-the-bone-21kc</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/tolgee_i18n/faster-optimizing-react-app-to-the-bone-21kc</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Tolgee platform, we manage translations. So our most important view is a list of translations, every row contains key and related translations in different languages. As this view serves multiple purposes, we have quite a lot of requirements and fulfilling all of them required quite a bit of optimizations, which I'd like to share with you today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-are-we-dealing-with"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What are we dealing with
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mainly, a whole view is using infinite scrolling, where we automatically fetch additional data when user scrolls down. Every row needs to have some buttons, so he can edit, select or modify state of translations. We have search and filters, which should work swiftly when applied. Then we have resible columns, which allow user to change whole layout by mouse dragging. We also need to detect overflowing text vertically, which can't be done simply through css, but we need to "test render" it first and then see if it fits. And last but not least (as new features will surely come in the future), everything need to work with focus, so user can controll it through keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-identify-problems-generally"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to identify problems generally
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically always when your React application is slow it's due to too many components re-rendering or too often. React have very useful Developer Tools, where you can profile your App and then find out which components are taking most of the time to render.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I identified slow components, I needed to understand why exactly is rendering so slow.&lt;br&gt;
One might think that if we keep our components small, the amount of rendering should be managable, but as it turned out this was not the case. Main problem is that components often depend on one another (like parent and child or using same data) and when small change in your state causes a big chunk of your app to re-render, you might have to apply additional optimizations, which React doesn't make automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make sure that my optimizations are actually working I've brought my super old laptop to work, which I've considered the most reliable benchmark of improvement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#one-problem-at-a-time"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  One problem at a time
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will now try to ilustrate different situations on the example of our app and offer a way which we choosed as a solution. It is important to understand what exactly is happening, because optimizations are often tradeoffs - you exchange comfort (elegance/convenience/generality) for speed. So if you do incorrect optimizations, you might improve nothing and only ruin your code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#optimizing-state-management"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Optimizing state management
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we simply use Context API for our main state, we end up re-rendering almost entire view on every change. This issue is mostly visible when we use search field, as typing will become unbearably slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--09glPmyq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/051445jqbg09ql6g0n0j.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--09glPmyq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/051445jqbg09ql6g0n0j.gif" alt="Slow typing" width="640" height="302"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can solve this by using some state management tool (e.g. Redux, MobX, ...), or you can use context in a clever way, so you minimize re-rendering (check my previous &lt;a href="https://dev.to/tolgee_i18n/react-doesnt-need-state-management-tool-i-said-31l4"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#large-number-of-children-rerender"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Large number of children re-render
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clever state management still won't protect us completely against unnecessary re-renders. In some cases the fact the Component update causes all children re-render can be too expensive. You can avoid this by wrapping each child with &lt;code&gt;React.memo&lt;/code&gt; - React will then render child only when props change. However, make sure that you fully understand how it works in the &lt;a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactmemo"&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt;, and then check that it really helped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our case we wrap each row in the list with &lt;code&gt;React.memo&lt;/code&gt;. Because the row is relying mostly on fetched data, we can save quite a lot of unnecessary re-rendering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#infinite-scolling"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Infinite scolling
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our main problem now is that our page can have bascially infinite number of components. A way to solve this is to only render elements, that are currently visible to the user. It's better to use some third party solution for this, because it's quite complicated to do right. After some trial and error we ended up with library &lt;code&gt;react-list&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Libraries like these usually require you to specify size of the components upfront (as they need to calculate a full length of the scrollable area without actually rendering the content), which can be quite problematic - in our case row sizes are variable and so we can't really tell how big it will be untill we render it. &lt;code&gt;react-list&lt;/code&gt; is able to solve this by only asking you to estimate the size of rows and then when it actually renders the element, it updates the size automatically. This can lead to your scrollbar jumping (as a height of the container is changing while you are scrolling in it), but if your estimation is somehow decent, it is pretty minor issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice! So now we decreased an overall number of components displayed from infinity to "it depends on your screen size". However we have another problem ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SjsdeIou--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fu1p2sib6j2uuk58wjui.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SjsdeIou--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fu1p2sib6j2uuk58wjui.gif" alt="Slow scrolling" width="640" height="302"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#reducing-rows-complexity"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Reducing rows complexity
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our infinite scrolling optimization wasn't without tradeoff. It takes siginificant time to render each row and because user can scroll quite fast, it can lead to content not keeping up with scrolling. Problem that is related to this is our resizeble layout which is also very slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xc3BkLIF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8nbcf6qhxs0xqxub2kx8.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xc3BkLIF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8nbcf6qhxs0xqxub2kx8.gif" alt="Slow resizing" width="640" height="302"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is quite difficult problem, because only thing that you can do here is to reduce complexity of individual rows. In our case we've mostly solved it by clever usage of css &lt;code&gt;grid&lt;/code&gt;, which allowed us create complex layouts using only few html elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing was to prevent displaying unnecessary stuff on first render. All our buttons are hidden by default and only appear when you hover the given row. We were doing this only by css, which doesn't help React at all. So my solution was to hide the buttons for real (not render them) and show them only &lt;code&gt;onmouseover&lt;/code&gt;, which improved situation quite significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This solution brought a new problem, that you were not able to use focus with &lt;code&gt;tab&lt;/code&gt;, as buttons were not actually present. I've solved this by always rendering first and last button (but hiding them with css) and other buttons would render when focus is within the row itself or when mouseover - this way user won't recognize the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was quite scared when I realized that our Application is becoming very slow and at the end I've spend one full week with these optimizations, but after some trial and error I've understood weak points and was able to target them. Considering the complexity it works fine even on my super old university laptop and I've learned a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm now happy developer and I spend quite a lot of my working time just scrolling around in our App.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SItArf_B--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/y2f23t3aws9kliso4hda.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SItArf_B--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/y2f23t3aws9kliso4hda.gif" alt="Fast scrolling" width="640" height="326"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

      <title>🚀 A powerful drag and drop implementation in just 16 lines of JavaScript</title>
      <author>Siddharth</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Nov 2021 06:44:02 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/siddharthshyniben/a-powerful-drag-and-drop-implementation-in-just-16-lines-of-javascript-d5d</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/siddharthshyniben/a-powerful-drag-and-drop-implementation-in-just-16-lines-of-javascript-d5d</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Drag and drop is a very useful tool in applications as it can simplify a large part of the process for users. It's also a common task we delegate to other libraries which may bloat your app when you just need &lt;em&gt;a very simple implementation&lt;/em&gt; when you can use the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API"&gt;Drag and Drop Web API&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Today, I'll show you how you can do just that!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-we-are-making"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What we are making
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the basic implementation we are aiming to build:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/SiddharthShyniben/embed/OJjePGv?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was made in just 16 lines of JavaScript!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with a few more lines we can add a lot more bonus features! Here's a demo with some more features!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/SiddharthShyniben/embed/xxLNJxj?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Play around with it, you will see that we can&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drop elements only in certain places&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Style the element in which we are dropping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Style the original copy of the dragged element&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(With a little trickery) even style the dragged element!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this with just 30 lines of code!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It works on almost all desktop browsers with partial support all the way back to IE 6(!) which should be enough for this to work, but it doesn't work on some mobile browsers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the up-to-date CanIUse data here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--h5Rn_oW2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://caniuse.bitsofco.de/image/dragndrop.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--h5Rn_oW2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://caniuse.bitsofco.de/image/dragndrop.jpg" alt="Data on support for the drag and drop feature across the major browsers from caniuse.com" width="800" height="366"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dealing with libraries for this very basic functionality has been a pain for me, and to save you the trouble I thought I'd document the process here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#html-structure"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  HTML structure
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#places-to-drag-into"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Places to drag into
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need some drop targets to be able to drag something into them right? We can add these using regular divs:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'drop'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'drop'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'drop'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'drop'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I'll be referring to the places we can drop into as drop targets in this post&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can add as many of them wherever you like, as long as an element has the &lt;code&gt;drop&lt;/code&gt; class we &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; be able to drop into them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also add some basic styles for them to look nice.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;box-sizing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;border-box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;sans-serif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.drop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;220px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;45px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#2563EB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin-bottom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;3px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-element-to-drag"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The element to drag
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an element to be draggable, we need, well, an element! We can place the element in one of the drop targets we made before. This is how it should look like&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'drop'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'drag'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;draggable=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'true'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;ondragstart=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'event.dataTransfer.setData('&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;plain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;',&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;)'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        Drag me!
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'drop'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'drop'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'drop'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notice how we also set the &lt;code&gt;draggable&lt;/code&gt; attribute to true. Every draggable element needs to have the &lt;code&gt;draggable&lt;/code&gt; attribute set for it to be draggable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, not every element can be dragged even if the &lt;code&gt;draggable&lt;/code&gt; attribute is set. We need to explicitly say that the element is draggable by listening to the &lt;code&gt;dragstart&lt;/code&gt; event in the HTML. There we are setting &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; as we don't have any data to share and we are setting the data type &lt;code&gt;text/plain&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can (again) also add some basic styles for them to look nice.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;#drag&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;200px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;25px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;3px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;black&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;white&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;grid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;align-items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;justify-content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Note that as long as an element has the &lt;code&gt;draggable&lt;/code&gt; attribute set to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; and the drop targets have the &lt;code&gt;drop&lt;/code&gt; class, the below code should work everywhere&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-minimal-implementation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The minimal implementation
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our drag and drop to be functional, we just need 3 different event listeners. Everything else is a bonus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we need to store the element we are dragging. We can do this by listening to the &lt;code&gt;dragstart&lt;/code&gt; event.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dragged&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;dragstart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dragged&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whenever an element is dragged, this will store the dragged element in a variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we can listen to drop events so we can drop elements.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;drop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Prevent default behaviour (sometimes opening a link)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;preventDefault&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;drop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dragged&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;parentNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;removeChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dragged&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dragged&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whenever we drop an element, if the element is a drop target (has the &lt;code&gt;drop&lt;/code&gt; class) we will append the dragged element to the drop target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're almost done, but we need to do one more thing to make this work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default, dragging elements does nothing, so to prevent the default behavior we need to call &lt;code&gt;event.preventDefault&lt;/code&gt; whenever we drag over the drop target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is easy to achieve with a oneliner:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;dragover&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;preventDefault&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That's it! In 16 lines we have functional drag and drop!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/SiddharthShyniben/embed/OJjePGv?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a video of it in action:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xp-mspR8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1637759563871/Jbnu70TS1.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xp-mspR8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1637759563871/Jbnu70TS1.gif" alt="Minimal drag and drop" width="663" height="632"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#adding-more-features"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Adding more features
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if this drag and drop &lt;em&gt;works&lt;/em&gt;, it's not very nice. It doesn't seem very "natural". Luckily, in a few lines of code, we can make this drag and drop even better!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#styling-the-original-dragged-element"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Styling the original dragged element
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever we drag an element, the original copy of the element doesn't change its style. It would look better if we could add a different style to these dragged elements, like making them transparent to show that it is being dragged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is very easy to do. Just add the styles in the &lt;code&gt;dragstart&lt;/code&gt; event listener.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;dragstart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;opacity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// add more styles as you like...&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But we also need to reset the style once we finish dragging. We can do that by listening to &lt;code&gt;dragend&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addeventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;dragend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;opacity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#styling-the-drop-targets"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Styling the drop targets
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also style the drop target by listening to the &lt;code&gt;dragenter&lt;/code&gt; event:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;dragenter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;drop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;#2c41cc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once again, we need to reset the styles once we leave the element. We can do that by listening to &lt;code&gt;dragleave&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;dragleave&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;drop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We also need to reset the styles once we drop the event. We can edit the &lt;code&gt;drop&lt;/code&gt; event to achieve this.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;drop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;drop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#styling-the-dragged-copy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Styling the dragged copy
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a bit of trickery, we can style the dragged copy too! Maybe we can rotate the element a bit to make it a bit more natural.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can do this by styling the original copy and immediately undoing those styles in the &lt;code&gt;dragstart&lt;/code&gt; event so that the users don't see it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;dragstart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;rotate(-2deg)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now the dragged copy will appear to be rotated when we are dragging it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You now have a fully functioning drag and drop implementation!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/SiddharthShyniben/embed/xxLNJxj?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a video of it in action:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xqrFnCrf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1637760011123/xOQLondbk.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xqrFnCrf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1637760011123/xOQLondbk.gif" alt="Complete drag and drop.gif" width="663" height="632"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/SiddharthShyniben/cd35cf13929e93b4210ffae72b57f986"&gt;Here's a Gist with all the source code for reference&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took a task for which we very commonly delegate to libraries and implemented it ourselves, with surprisingly little code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this opens your eyes to how much you can do with just vanilla JS. You don't need libraries every time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever tried implementing drag and drop on your own? Share in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;
