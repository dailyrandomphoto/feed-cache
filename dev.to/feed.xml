      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many people have false starts with test-driven development (TDD). When I discuss it with people I feel many people have some misunderstandings around the method, in particular the motivations behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe if developers have a better understanding of why to use it, they’ll have a better chance of practicing TDD more effectively and get more value out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This posts explores the reasons for using TDD and offers some guidance as to how to practice it more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was invited to speak about this topic at the GoSG, a meet-up for the Go programming enthusiasts in Singapore. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VKs3rrSHF8&amp;amp;t=2714s"&gt;You can find the recording on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com"&gt;This post quotes Growing Object-Oriented Software Guided by Tests (GOOS)&lt;/a&gt; (written by Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce) extensively as it aligns very closely with how I was taught TDD. I strongly suggest grabbing a copy and giving it a read. Ignore that the examples are in Java, the main lessons from the book are broadly language-agnostic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re new to software development, there’s several knowledge hurdles you need to leap over. The one you’ll be judged on the most is your ability to use the tools in front of you to get stuff working and get it to the customers. How well you do this and how delightful the result can be referred to as &lt;strong&gt;external quality&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you get proficient at this, the main challenges facing mid-level and above are to do with &lt;strong&gt;internal quality&lt;/strong&gt;. This focuses on your ability to work on and design systems so that the cost of change is reasonable. This is important because if a system is useful, it will have to change over its lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When talking to non-technical folk about this, you can use an analogy of the quality of a factory, and its equipment. If parts of your machinery are unreliable or hard to deal with, the factory will begin to grind to a halt. This is also true of software. &lt;strong&gt;If internal quality declines, the ability to affect the external quality of the software will decline too&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of software developers out there who can bash the code out enough to make useful software. A problem in our industry is we’re often incentivised and praised by our ability to work through “tickets” quickly and trying to hit (often arbitrary) deadlines. Frequently though, the internal quality gets neglected, and we hear these stories over and over again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is the estimate for changing the system 3 weeks? It should be 3 days!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to spend a month re-writing the Foobar module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t stand to work on this legacy system again. Please let me move to a different project, or I’ll find somewhere else to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are fewer developers who can write software that can live for many years without painful re-writes and staggering maintenance costs. The reason simply is, it’s really hard. It requires effort and study. I’ve been writing software for over 15 years and I still find it hard and feel the need to keep studying and reflecting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are developers and stakeholders who have advanced skills in justifying reasons for not caring about internal quality. They’ll say things like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing that matters is working software&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about time to market?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All&lt;/em&gt; worthwhile systems have to be changed (see &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehman's_laws_of_software_evolution"&gt;Lehman’s laws of software evolution&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;strong&gt;“All that matters is working software” can’t be used as an excuse for poor internal quality today when you will have to change the external quality tomorrow.&lt;/strong&gt; People tend to under-estimate the costs of poor internal quality and &lt;em&gt;over-estimate&lt;/em&gt; the cost of keeping internal quality high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to be thinking about the design of your system because the problem you are solving is different to everyone else’s. Domain knowledge (or lack-of) has a giant impact on what designs are suitable, so no single blog post can tell you how to design &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; system. It’s your responsibility as an engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many developers work in environments which have a real fear around speed of delivery, and you can get tempted in to short-term promises of productivity. A new programming language! &lt;a href="https://dev.to/gypsydave5/why-you-shouldnt-use-a-web-framework-3g24"&gt;A shiny new framework&lt;/a&gt;. Even folder structures in the Go community seem to be endlessly discussed as some kind of silver-bullet to good software. Chasing these things is a distraction and is not equipping you to strengthen your skills at writing software with high internal quality, you’re just learning &lt;em&gt;another thing&lt;/em&gt; that will be unfashionable in a few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why I think TDD is such a valuable method. It gives you a structured way to confront and think about the internal quality of &lt;strong&gt;your&lt;/strong&gt; system. TDD is a skill which can work in any context, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/quii/status/1396731981698842625"&gt;even on Mars&lt;/a&gt;. It is an excellent tool for training yourself and your team to design better software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TDD can be seen as a developer frivolity that slows teams down. This is true when you are first learning it (like any skill) but with practice and training, you’ll find yourself working at a sustainable pace and consistently delivering value. &lt;strong&gt;High internal quality will facilitate improvements to external quality&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/adamluzsi"&gt;Adam Luzsi &lt;/a&gt;points out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… most people who start to learn TDD, are also in the process of learning software design implicitly through TDD. And this causes the feeling of "this slows me down".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High internal quality is not exclusive to practitioners of TDD but if you’re on the fence about TDD I hope this post encourages you to take another look. Maybe at least make you reflect on your own methods for writing great software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-tdd"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is TDD?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Test-driven development is conceptually simple to follow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a test for a small, desired behaviour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See it fail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write just enough code to make it pass&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refactor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to 1 for next increment of behaviour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, there appears to be many developers diverging a lot from what was described by Kent Beck and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This inconsistency makes discussing the merits of TDD difficult because every so often what someone believed to be a typical TDD process seemed to be following a TDD-like process but getting key parts of it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does this happen? I think tech in general suffers a problem of being extremely faddy and people not really understanding &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; they are adopting a particular framework or technique. &lt;strong&gt;If you don’t understand what TDD is for, you’re unlikely to practice it effectively.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#so-why-testdriven-development"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  So, why test-driven development?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the typical answers you’ll get:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prevent defects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good test coverage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confidence to refactor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rightly some will argue:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These benefits are not unique to writing tests first&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-write-tests-first"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why write tests &lt;strong&gt;first?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s worth exploring the why of TDD in detail as I believe it helps clarify &lt;strong&gt;how to use the method effectively&lt;/strong&gt;. Many people have false starts with TDD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GOOS picks up on this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve seen teams that write tests and code at about the same time where the code is a mess and the tests just raise the cost of maintenance. They’d made a start but hadn’t yet learned that the trick … to let the tests guide development.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#you-have-to-know-what-behaviour-youre-trying-to-build-to-write-a-test"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  You have to know what behaviour you’re trying to build to write a test
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers go too fast, diving in to code and letting their imaginations run wild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jocrossick"&gt;Jo Crossick on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I write tests first, it's because I know that I'm itching to write over-complicated, over-ambitious code that is destined to become a hot mess, and tests is the only thing that can hold me back from creating instant technical debt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lack of method to the design process can lead to software designed against loose, ill-defined requirements. This design can quickly become a drag on the team’s productivity. It can confuse developers, baking-in to your system assumptions that are untrue and behaviours that aren’t actually needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing a test first &lt;strong&gt;demands you precisely define, and focus on what you’re trying to achieve; this is a key part of the design process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing a test first means you have to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remove any ambiguity, meaning you have to &lt;strong&gt;really understand the behaviour you need&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cut down the scope to a small piece of useful functionality, &lt;strong&gt;liberating you from having to design the whole system&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than having to be somehow clever enough to know all the requirements the system would ever need and committing to a design, instead you design code for behaviour you have precisely defined. You design, for one thing at a time, and you do it properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#it-offers-a-fast-and-continuous-feedback-loop-on-your-design"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  It offers a fast and continuous feedback loop on your design
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing a test gives you a sense of the design of a particular unit &lt;strong&gt;at the beginning&lt;/strong&gt;. Many developers will dive in, creating types and abstractions for hours on end and only when they plug it all together and run their application do they begin to see the flaws in their design. &lt;strong&gt;Until code is executed and the behaviours observed, the design has had no &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; validation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With TDD you get feedback at the start and as you iterate through more behaviour you will keep getting guidance from your tests. There is no faster way of getting feedback on your design than by declaring what success looks like at the start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will have a sense of progress as you take small, validated steps toward your goal. If practiced well, you won’t end up in situations of having to throw hours or days worth of code away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst not being unique to &lt;strong&gt;test-first&lt;/strong&gt;, tests reflect your design back at you. If a test is difficult to read or write, it is telling you something. A key skill for practicing TDD well is to &lt;strong&gt;listen to your tests&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#it-gives-you-momentum-and-by-focusing-on-internal-quality-will-help-you-continue-to-change-your-software-cheaply"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  It gives you momentum and by focusing on internal quality will help you continue to change your software cheaply.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many developers “spin many plates”, darting from one part of the code to the other, changing different bits of code and in general working in a fairly chaotic way. This way of working makes life difficult and more prone to error and re-work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing a test first acts as a stabiliser&lt;/strong&gt;. This sets you a clear, short-term objective and lets you focus on doing one thing well, rather than worrying about competing concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The refactoring step improves your chances of maintaining good internal quality which is &lt;em&gt;essential&lt;/em&gt; for a system to be malleable. We’ve all worked on systems where the internal quality is terrible and how frustrating it is how difficult it can be to make a seemingly simple change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iterative nature of TDD means you keep working on achieving one small improvement at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#it-does-not-slow-you-down"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  It does not slow you down
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.geepawhill.org/2018/04/14/tdd-the-lump-of-coding-fallacy/"&gt;https://www.geepawhill.org/2018/04/14/tdd-the-lump-of-coding-fallacy/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GeePaw has an excellent video which dispels the idea that TDD slows you down. In fact, it's the opposite when you forget about the silly idea that software development's bottleneck is simply typing code. &lt;strong&gt;Thinking is the bottleneck&lt;/strong&gt;, we work in a knowledge-based field and TDD offers us a way to think with clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s true that when you first practice TDD you will go slower than before. In cases where maybe your design skills aren’t as strong as you think, TDD may feel frustrating, but you can use it as a tool to improve your ability to write modular code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a skill that has to be learned and practiced but with time you’ll find yourself working quicker, confidently and with more focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-qualities-required-to-make-code-unittestable-are-good-qualities-in-themselves"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The qualities required to make code unit-testable are good qualities in themselves
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GOOS:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…the effort of writing a test first also gives us rapid feedback about the quality of our design ideas—that making code accessible for testing often drives it towards being cleaner and more modular.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modular code is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to repurpose and re-use within different contexts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focused&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple to test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small, with clear responsibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to understand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many developers have a healthy skepticism to premature abstraction, but it can go too far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not good to have that &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; of code mixed up within a function featuring 100s of lines of code, with mixed up and complected concerns. Rich Hickey covers the topic of easiness vs simplicity in his incredible talk &lt;a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/"&gt;Simple Made Easy&lt;/a&gt;. Having all your code in one method is “easy”, but it is not simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systems built up of modular, &lt;em&gt;cohesive&lt;/em&gt; units are simpler to understand and easier to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#its-easier-to-write-good-tests-beforehand"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  It’s easier to write good tests beforehand
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing tests after the code is written is challenging to get right. You can end up with tests that may not fail when you want them to, have cryptic error messages or simply not have good coverage. You’ll also fall in to the trap of testing your design, rather than the behaviour (more on this later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing tests first and seeing them fail helps you validate their usefulness and helps you focus on testing from the consumer’s point of view, rather than the person who wrote it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#it-requires-you-to-constantly-refactor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  It requires you to constantly refactor
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key, but often skipped step by novices is the refactoring step. It is far easier and more sustainable to do frequent, small refactors around the code you’re actually working on throughout the day, rather than leaving it for “a refactoring/technical-debt sprint”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ill-factored code makes the system harder to re-design. Often the &lt;em&gt;act&lt;/em&gt; of refactoring reveals designs. As you consolidate code and DRY things up you start to “see” abstractions that can simplify matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#digression-refactoring-sprints-are-an-absurd-idea-and-point-to-some-real-team-disfunction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Digression: Refactoring sprints are an absurd idea and point to some real team disfunction
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want the benefits of increased internal quality &lt;strong&gt;now&lt;/strong&gt;, not in 3 weeks time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone knows they are hard to do and frequently fail to give the pay-off you’d hope for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s your job to maintain internal quality because &lt;strong&gt;that’s what helps you deliver external quality at a reasonable cost&lt;/strong&gt;. Don’t ask for permission to do your job.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#%C2%A0how-to-use-tdd"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
   How to use TDD
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#work-iteratively-in-small-positive-steps"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Work iteratively, in small positive steps
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working on a single, small, well-defined thing is simple, and you’re more likely to succeed. You’ll get fast feedback on whether you’re going in the right direction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working on many, large, loosely defined things at once is difficult, and you’re more likely to make mistakes. The feedback loop is slow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When practicing TDD you should always be thinking about how to reach the vague end-state with specific, achievable steps. If you’re writing a unit test that you know will take hours of effort to make it pass, you need to rethink your approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be challenging to break work down into small steps, and it will also challenge your design skills but working this way means you are more likely to succeed, and you’ll reduce waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#when-tdd-feels-right"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  When TDD feels right
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constant, small progress throughout the day. Never feels slow, feels deliberate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frequent commits to source control per hour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work feels “safe”, less chaotic than maybe you’re used to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mistakes are rarely large. Happy to revert changes if you realise you’ve gone down a wrong path.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#writing-the-test-first"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Writing the test first
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a difference between knowing to write a test first and doing it in a way that helps you design your software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GOOS:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We want each test to be as clear as possible an expression of the behaviour to be performed by the system or object. While writing the test, we ignore the fact that the test won’t run, or even compile, and just concentrate on its text”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than worrying about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; the code will work at this point, &lt;strong&gt;concentrate on the behaviour, particularly from the user’s point of view&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s essential you block out implementation detail from your head at this point in the process because you’re just trying to nail down exactly &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; you want to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;what and the how are two separate design activities&lt;/strong&gt; which are too often mixed up, which makes coherent decision-making more difficult than it needs to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on being precise and limited in scope&lt;/strong&gt;, this will help you uncover assumptions and help you keep focused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TDD is an iterative approach to development&lt;/strong&gt;. When you are writing your tests you should be mindful of how to keep the work moving with fast feedback loops and small positive steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#start-from-the-top-down-for-new-features"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Start from the top down for new features
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TDD is focused on letting you design for the behaviour you precisely need, iteratively. When starting on a new area you need to identify a key, important behaviour and then aggressively cut scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there you want to take a “top down” approach, starting with an acceptance test (AT) that exercises the behaviour from the outside. This will act as a north-star for your efforts. All you should be focused on is making that test pass. This test will likely be failing for a while whilst you develop enough code to make it pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--t2n2TnRS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/pxTaYu4.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--t2n2TnRS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/pxTaYu4.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have your AT set up you can then break into the TDD process to drive out enough units to make the AT pass. The trick is to not worry too much about design at this point, just get enough code to make the AT pass because at this point you’re still learning and exploring the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking this first step is often bigger than you think, setting up web-servers, routing, configuration e.t.c, which is why keeping the scope of the work small is important. We want to make that first positive step on our blank canvas, have it backed by a passing AT so that we can then continue to iterate quickly and safely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7vRauYFe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/t5y5opw.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7vRauYFe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/t5y5opw.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you develop, listen to your tests, and they should give you signals to help you push your design in a better direction but again, anchored to the behaviour rather than our imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, your first “unit” that does the hard work to make the AT pass will grow too big to be comfortable, even for this small amount of behaviour. This is when you can start thinking about how to break the problem down and introduce new collaborators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Zo8WInbW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/UYqd7Cq.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Zo8WInbW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/UYqd7Cq.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where test-doubles are very useful because most of the complexity that lives internally within software doesn’t usually reside in implementation detail, but “between” the units and how they interact with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;/*
The design "outside the braces" is what often has 
the biggest impact on internal quality
*/

func NewStockCheckHandler(
    stockChecker StockChecker, 
    productStore ProductStore,
) http.Handler {

/* 
implementation detail inside the braces is usually 
low thrills and simple to test
*/

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can use test-doubles to explore the interactions between our collaborators with a much tighter feedback loop than if we tried to design and develop units isolated and then integrate them later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For further iterations we may not need to write a new AT, we can simply add new behaviours to our existing units at a faster pace than the first one. We’ve made our first step, and we’re confident that we’re not developing them blindly because the units are integrated with the rest of the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#on-tdding-a-design"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  On “TDD-ing a design”
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too often people assert that TDD is only compatible with a “bottom-up” approach where you imagine a bunch of abstractions up-front and then you “TDD them”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is called “TDD-ing a design”. You’re not using TDD as a design method, merely a way of writing tests around some code. This often results in classes or functions being overly developed in isolation for extended periods and then only when you try to integrate them into the system and use them you realise the design is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the point where people declare TDD to be a poor design tool when in practice, they already had a design in their head and just added a very long feedback loop to it, exhaustively testing code and various edge-cases before &lt;em&gt;using it in their actual system&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that TDD demands we start with a test for a desired &lt;em&gt;behaviour,&lt;/em&gt; not a &lt;em&gt;design&lt;/em&gt;. This is very much “top down” development. When done correctly you stop “over-designing” and you write and design the code you actually need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By TDD-ing a design you can fall into the trap of tests being tightly coupled to implementation rather than behaviour. This becomes extremely problematic when you want to change your implementation detail and your tests will become a burden. &lt;a href="https://quii.dev/The_Tests_Talk"&gt;I talk about this in detail in “The Tests Talk”.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#listen-to-your-tests"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Listen to your tests
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you follow the TDD process well you should end up with modular, loosely coupled, cohesive units within your system. This journey is rarely smooth. As requirements and knowledge changes your design will have to evolve with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tests can offer you a &lt;em&gt;focused lens&lt;/em&gt; into areas in your system where you can view the impact of your design isolated, which makes it far easier to appraise. &lt;strong&gt;Tests reflect your design back at you&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some common test smells to look out for. Commit them to memory, and you’ll be able to raise some interesting questions about your design to answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#high-number-of-testdoubles-mocks-complicated-setup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  High number of test-doubles (mocks), complicated setup
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is telling you that the unit under test has to collaborate with many things, this pain in your test world will be multiplied in all the cases you want to use this unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pain can sometimes feel hidden in the “real” usages but comes apparent when you start to change things and feel the pain of the tight and inappropriate coupling. You should be asking yourself why this unit has to collaborate with so many other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It points to leaky abstractions which could be remedied by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at the test doubles. Are you having to mock out lots of methods? Perhaps you can consolidate this interaction into another more cohesive unit

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe the unit itself has too many, unrelated behaviours. See if you can come up with a more cohesive design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#unclear-intent"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Unclear intent
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does your test &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; explain the code’s behaviour and why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GOOS:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A test called testBidAccepted() tells us what it does, but not what it’s for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the test is unclear it could mean the responsibilities of the unit being tested is unclear and warrants a redesign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#wide-scope"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Wide scope
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This points to a lack of focus. Perhaps you need to break the problem down in to smaller parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#value-the-quality-of-your-tests"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Value the quality of your tests
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start being more attentive about the quality of your test code. This will result in you writing tests that are cheaper to maintain and will challenge you to write more focused, modular code resulting a better designed system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing high-quality tests is cheaper than maintaining poorly written ones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a high-performing team where it must respond to client needs quickly and cheaply, good tests will enable them to have a productive experience. The opposite is also true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write the tests you want to see&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest, most generic feedback I give to my colleagues is asking them to explain their tests out-loud. Often it’s harder than they imagine, even when the tests appear terse; and then an interesting conversation about the design almost always follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflect on the tests you have now. Do they express the intent of the behaviour well? Do they describe the &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; clearly? If not, what would it take? Is it a simple refactoring of your tests or does it require some redesign?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#be-attentive-when-you-watch-the-test-fail"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Be attentive when you watch the test fail
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be sure it fails the way you expect and that it fails with a clear message. If you skip this step you may be glossing over design decisions, or perhaps you don’t understand the requirements clearly enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually making the test fails “nicely” is a multi-step process, but it’s important to go through the steps until you get a satisfactory failure message due to your code not exhibiting the failure you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#view-being-in-the-red-as-something-to-get-out-of-as-soon-as-possible"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  View being in “the red” as something to get out of as soon as possible
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should be running your unit tests extremely frequently, which is why it’s important they run quickly and don’t depend on slow things like the network or file-system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If at any point your tests are failing (so you’re in the red), you should be thinking about the shortest path to get back to “green”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often the safest way to do this is to revert your changes. By working in small increments this should never feel like a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is forbidden to refactor or redesign code in the red state because your feedback loop as to whether the changes are valid is broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#commit-your-work-frequently"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Commit your work frequently
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be able to use your tests to help you guide your design they need to be green, but it’s inevitable that sometimes you’ll go down the wrong path and want to get back to safety. It’s therefore critical that you practice good source control practices and commit your work frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually commit my work once I’ve made the test pass and that means if I get into a bad state during refactoring I can easily get back to working software again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much of applying TDD is working in small, safe steps, so your mind is freer to think about the design of your system rather than juggling multiple concerns at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#refactor-aggressively-when-in-the-green"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Refactor aggressively when in the green
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the time your system should be in a state when you can refactor freely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ill-factored code is problematic because it becomes hard to understand, which makes it harder to re-design. The process of refactoring in general will reveal improvements in the design for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read Martin Fowler’s refactoring book and get in to the habit of applying common refactors. A lot of code I observe is not well-factored, but the good news is it’s a relatively easy skill to learn and once you’re proficient takes a matter of seconds or minutes to perform; in particular with help from your IDE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#wrapping-up"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Wrapping up
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t practice TDD, what is your method for designing software? You do you! Can you describe your method to someone else, so they can follow a similar approach? It’s healthy to retrospect on how you work, to see if there are ways to improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter your design method, internal quality is essential for the productivity of your team. So many systems suffer from poor productivity and high costs because some developers and teams will neglect internal quality. It’s a false-economy to ignore internal quality and the pace at which you will be able to affect the external quality of the system will decrease quickly if you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is of course possible to have software with high internal quality without practicing TDD, but I am not especially clever and want an easy life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I design up front:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s often wrong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have to think about too many things at once&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I design for things I don’t need&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TDD offers a methodical, incremental way of designing code which feels like a simpler, more evidence-based way of creating useful, malleable software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stick to the simple TDD process, listen to your tests and practice. This should result in you designing software, verified against concrete desired behaviours; rather than your imagination.   &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Short Polling vs Long Polling</title>
      <author>Bibek</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 28 May 2021 14:28:12 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/bibekkakati/short-polling-vs-long-polling-2fme</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/bibekkakati/short-polling-vs-long-polling-2fme</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone👋&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before proceeding, I am assuming, you are aware of the request-response architecture of a basic web application. To build a real-time application like a chat application we can't use the basic request-response architecture, but we can use it with a &lt;code&gt;polling&lt;/code&gt; mechanism to achieve the real-time behaviour. Apart from the polling mechanism we also have &lt;code&gt;SSE(server-side event)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;WebSocket&lt;/code&gt; to achieve real-time behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, I am going to discuss two types of polling techniques i.e, &lt;code&gt;long polling&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;short polling&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we need to know, what is &lt;code&gt;polling&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#polling"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Polling
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polling is a technique in which the client sends a request to the server asking for data in an interval of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response from the server can be empty or any kind of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#short-polling"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Short Polling
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Short Polling&lt;/code&gt; is a technique in which the client sends a request to the server asking for data at fixed delays after getting a response from the previously sent request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Client&lt;/strong&gt; sends a request to the &lt;strong&gt;Server&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Server&lt;/strong&gt; responds with an empty response or data, if available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Client&lt;/strong&gt; will wait for the specified delay after receiving the response and continues the same request-response process again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This technique is very simple and doesn't consume server resources, but event notifications are not so instant and there will be some delay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#example"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Example
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A client sends a request to the server asking for data, but the data is not available at that time and the server responds with an empty response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The client will wait for 5 seconds before sending the next request. That means if, in that interval of time (5 seconds), any data is available the client will not be notified about this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The client will be able to get the data when it sends the next request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this technique is not so instant, and there will some delay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#long-polling"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Long Polling
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Long Polling&lt;/code&gt; is a technique in which the client sends a request to the server asking for data, but the server doesn't respond instantly if no data is available, rather it waits for a specific amount of time. If in that interval of time, any event happens or data become available, the server will respond with that data and in case of no events or data, the server will respond with an empty response after the specified timeout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This technique is more complex and does consume server resources, but it can notify the client without any delay so it can give a better real-time experience.&lt;/p&gt;

      <author>fischgeek</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 28 May 2021 14:25:47 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/fischgeek/dotnetdates-4ok1</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/fischgeek/dotnetdates-4ok1</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I made a little diddy I wanted to share with you all. It's nothing too grand or impressive. I just really like how it turned out and even more happy with the cleanliness of the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a simple form to play around with date formats in .NET. Here's the &lt;a href="https://github.com/fischgeek/DotNetDates"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and a screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dLbI4_bS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/10i3ea3bopl660s0x0cu.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dLbI4_bS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/10i3ea3bopl660s0x0cu.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was all written with F# (minus the C# Forms project bit). What is neat though is I only laid out the basic locations of where I wanted things to go using FlowLayoutPanels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4R1g3XUA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bik38ht2aekvynhavwox.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4R1g3XUA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bik38ht2aekvynhavwox.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then passed those to my F# to handle the rest.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;System.Windows.Forms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;DotNetDates.FSharp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;DotNetDates&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;partial&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Form1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Form&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Form1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nf"&gt;InitializeComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="kt"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;FormBuilder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flpFormatMethods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flpFormatSpecifiers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flpCustomFormats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flpCreateYourOwn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flpCreateYourOwnResult&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I'm curious to read what you think and thanks for checking it out!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What's New in Codesphere Version 1.11.2</title>
      <author>Saji Wang</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 28 May 2021 14:17:08 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/codesphere/what-s-new-in-codesphere-version-1-11-2-29d1</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/codesphere/what-s-new-in-codesphere-version-1-11-2-29d1</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest Codesphere updates!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#whats-new"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What's New?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#features"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Features
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;App Monitoring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code Search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added Python support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting today, Codesphere has a new interface to &lt;strong&gt;monitor your app&lt;/strong&gt;! The new feature will allow you to make sure that your app is running as expected, and let you know if you're under or over-estimating your computing needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're also happy to announce that you can now find a &lt;strong&gt;search bar&lt;/strong&gt; above your file tree, which gives you the ability to search through your codebase. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, we’ve added &lt;strong&gt;python support&lt;/strong&gt; as we understand that more and more developers are building their web apps in python-based frameworks like Django and Flask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a better idea of all our new feature releases, take a look at our new video on our &lt;a href="https://link.codesphere.com/I"&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Codesphere, we’ve been hard at work bringing you the next generation cloud platform so that you can spend less time configuring and more time doing what you do best: Actually Coding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is a feature we haven’t released yet that you’d like to see, comment down below! Otherwise, stay tuned for future releases!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, thanks for using Codesphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy coding!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  HTTP Cookies
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTTP cookies are known as a web cookie, Internet cookies, browser cookies. in the cookie, we can store a small piece of data that server send to your browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cookies are useful for Auth cookie tokens, to store in small text files, user preferences, color themes, game scores for many things you can use HTTP cookies. Its very easy to create cookies and delete cookies with JavaScript, PHP, NodeJS &amp;amp; Python etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cookies, we have many options like Expires, Domain, Path, Secure, Name they are used when we create a cookie or read a cookie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.Expire: we can use it to set the date the cookie will expire.&lt;br&gt;
2.Secure: a browser only use HTTP. &lt;br&gt;
3.Domain: The domain name of your site.&lt;br&gt;
4.Path: The path to the directory or web page that set the cookie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;

  How to set cookies with JS?
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For NodeJS, you need to require HTTP in your code and directly use cookies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pulumi - IaC in your favorite programming language!</title>
      <author>Techworld with Nana</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 28 May 2021 14:13:04 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/techworld_with_nana/pulumi-iac-in-your-favorite-programming-language-3i1m</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/techworld_with_nana/pulumi-iac-in-your-favorite-programming-language-3i1m</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy7NrYWoggjztwSskGu59O38gL5v0LjUT"&gt;DevOps tool of the month&lt;/a&gt; is a series, where each month I introduce one new useful DevOps tool in 2021 🙌🏼&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For May I chose: &lt;a href="https://www.pulumi.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pulumi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 🎉 - a modern Infrastructure as Code Tool for Developers.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-youtube-vijeidcsr3q-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vIjeiDcsR3Q"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-pulumi-and-how-its-different-from-other-iac-tools"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Pulumi and how it's different from other IaC tools 💡
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When writing IaC scripts using other tools, you usually have to use a DSL (like HCL in case of Terraform) of that tool or YAML or JSON which is a format that many tools use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem with YAML or JSON:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
It's easy to read and easy to define resources you want to create and that is great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if we need to add some logic in there, like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;conditionals, "create this EC2 instance, if xyz"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;or use loops, like "I want to create 20 EC2 Instances with the same configuration"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;or what about re-using logic? Like, "all 20 instances with this shared config, plus some specific configs"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It gets pretty complex in such formats. So all these logical operations, loops, reusing blocks of code is a natural part of any programming language, right? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So writing the same infrastructure as code logic in a programming language would obviously make writing more complex code easier and cleaner. And that's exactly what Pulumi did. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pulumi allows you to write infrastructure as code in a programming language&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now which programming language is that? 🤔 Well, you can actually choose whichever language you want to use Pulumi. You can write it in Node.js, Python, .net etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--w26iiwiq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ryr4w2aho4xr83hvkxo1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--w26iiwiq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ryr4w2aho4xr83hvkxo1.png" alt="Pulumi - choose favorite language"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So instead of having to learn a new syntax or DSL or a new language, you can use the language you are most proficient in and use it for writing infrastructure as code. 👍&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#main-benefits-of-using-a-programming-language-of-your-choice"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Main Benefits of using a Programming Language of your choice 🤩
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Use the same Programming Tools you know for Infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you are coding in Python for example, you probably have the most fitting IDE for it, like PyCharm, you have installed all the plugins for that languages, you have configured linters that tell you immediately if you have an error in the code or warning in your code quality. You know all the main libraries you can use in your code etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you know the whole eco-system of that language. And that means you can &lt;strong&gt;use&lt;/strong&gt; all that same eco-system and your &lt;strong&gt;expertise for now writing infrastructure as code&lt;/strong&gt;. And this can make your work much more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_mXZjkna--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bd3jaiwrxbi8macvelsf.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_mXZjkna--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bd3jaiwrxbi8macvelsf.png" alt="Use Programming Expertise for Infrastructure"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Treat Infrastructure as Code as Application Code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Another thing that we see emerging and becoming a standard is &lt;strong&gt;treating our infrastructure as code exactly the same way as our application code&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zQ9zfNdq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r962ers9e2jt6cfwn4c8.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zQ9zfNdq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r962ers9e2jt6cfwn4c8.png" alt="One Pipeline for Everyone"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That includes e.g. testing the code. Having unit tests, integration tests etc. So with YAML and JSON format or DSL, like HCL that Terraform uses, it's pretty difficult to write tests for these scripts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Pulumi obviously you have the advantage of simply writing tests for you IaC as for your application code, using the same test libraries, same language, same editor etc. 🙌🏼&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-pulumi-works-in-practice"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How Pulumi works in Practice 👩🏻‍💻
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the video to see how Pulumi works in practice. I will show you how to write a simple Pulumi project to first create an S3 bucket in an AWS account and then a more realistic example of provisioning an EKS cluster:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-comlink"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Comlink
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comlink makes WebWorkers enjoyable. Comlink is a tiny library (1.1kB), that removes the mental barrier of thinking about postMessage and hides the fact that you are working with workers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag-github-readme-tag"&gt;

&lt;div id="readme" class="md"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
Comlink&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comlink makes &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API" rel="nofollow"&gt;WebWorkers&lt;/a&gt; enjoyable. Comlink is a &lt;strong&gt;tiny library (1.1kB)&lt;/strong&gt;, that removes the mental barrier of thinking about &lt;code&gt;postMessage&lt;/code&gt; and hides the fact that you are working with workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a more abstract level it is an RPC implementation for &lt;code&gt;postMessage&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy" rel="nofollow"&gt;ES6 Proxies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="snippet-clipboard-content position-relative"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ npm install --save comlink
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On mobile phones, and especially on low-end mobile phones, it is important to keep the main thread as idle as possible so it can respond to user interactions quickly and provide a jank-free experience. &lt;strong&gt;The UI thread ought to be for UI work only&lt;/strong&gt;. WebWorkers are a web API that allow you to run code in a separate thread. To communicate with another thread, WebWorkers offer the &lt;code&gt;postMessage&lt;/code&gt; API. You can send JavaScript objects…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before getting started, &lt;a href="https://www.notion.com/my-integrations" rel="nofollow"&gt;create an integration&lt;/a&gt; and find the token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization" rel="nofollow"&gt;→ Learn more about authorization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Import and initialize a client using an &lt;strong&gt;integration token&lt;/strong&gt; or an OAuth &lt;strong&gt;access token&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-js position-relative js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; Client &lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;"@notionhq/client"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;// Initializing a client&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-s1"&gt;notion&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-v"&gt;Client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="pl-s1"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;NOTION_TOKEN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make a request to any Notion API endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the complete list of endpoints in the &lt;a href="https://developers.notion.com/reference" rel="nofollow"&gt;API reference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-s1"&gt;listUsersResponse&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-s1"&gt;notion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;users&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each method returns a &lt;code&gt;Promise&lt;/code&gt; which resolves the response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-js position-relative js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-s1"&gt;listUsersResponse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;// {&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;//   results: [&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capacitor is a cross-platform API and code execution layer that makes it easy to call Native SDKs from web code and to write custom native plugins that your app may need. Additionally, Capacitor provides first-class Progressive Web App support so you can write one app and deploy it to the app stores &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the mobile web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capacitor comes with a Plugin API for building native plugins. Plugins can be written inside Capacitor apps or packaged into an npm dependency for community use. Plugin authors are encouraged to use Swift to develop plugins in iOS and Kotlin (or Java) in Android.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Tailwind CSS plugin&lt;/strong&gt;
DaisyUI is a Tailwind CSS plugin. Install it, add it to your &lt;code&gt;tailwind.config.js&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Component classes&lt;/strong&gt;
Adds component classes to Tailwind. Classes like &lt;code&gt;btn&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;card&lt;/code&gt;,… So you will end up with a cleaner HTML.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Semantic color names&lt;/strong&gt;
Adds color names like &lt;code&gt;primary&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;secondary&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;accent&lt;/code&gt;,….&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Customizable&lt;/strong&gt;
You can customize the design of components with Tailwind utility classes and CSS variables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Themeable&lt;/strong&gt;
Add multiple themes and customize colors. You can even set a theme for a specific section of your page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;RTL supported&lt;/strong&gt;
Enable &lt;code&gt;rtl&lt;/code&gt; config for right to left layouts.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use your preferred package manager:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="snippet-clipboard-content position-relative"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install notistack
yarn add notistack
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
How to use&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:&lt;/strong&gt; Wrap your app inside a &lt;code&gt;SnackbarProvider&lt;/code&gt; component: (see &lt;a href="https://iamhosseindhv.com/notistack/api" rel="nofollow"&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; for a full list of available props)
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; If you're using material-ui &lt;code&gt;ThemeProvider&lt;/code&gt;, make sure &lt;code&gt;SnackbarProvider&lt;/code&gt; is a child of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-js position-relative js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-v"&gt;SnackbarProvider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;'notistack'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-ent"&gt;SnackbarProvider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;maxSnack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-ent"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-ent"&gt;SnackbarProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2:&lt;/strong&gt; Export any component that needs to send notification using &lt;code&gt;withSnackbar&lt;/code&gt;. By doing this, you'll have access to…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="gh-btn-container"&gt;&lt;a class="gh-btn" href="https://github.com/iamhosseindhv/notistack"&gt;View on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
Inspiration&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wanted a drag and drop library that just works? That doesn't just depend on bloated frameworks, that has great support? That actually understands where to place the elements when they are dropped? That doesn't need you to do a zillion things to get it to work? Well, so did I!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
Features&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Super easy to set up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No bloated dependencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Figures out sort order&lt;/strong&gt; on its own&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A shadow where the item would be dropped offers &lt;strong&gt;visual feedback&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Touch events!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seamlessly handles clicks &lt;em&gt;without any configuration&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
Install&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
SimpleBar does only one thing: replace the browser's default scrollbar with a custom CSS-styled one without losing performances&lt;br&gt;
Unlike some popular plugins, SimpleBar doesn't mimic scroll with Javascript, causing janks and strange scrolling behaviours&lt;br&gt;
You keep the awesomeness of native scrolling...with a custom scrollbar&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SimpleBar &lt;strong&gt;does NOT implement a custom scroll behaviour&lt;/strong&gt;. It keeps the &lt;strong&gt;native&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;overflow: auto&lt;/code&gt; scroll and &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; replace the scrollbar visual appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
Design it as you want&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SimpleBar uses pure CSS to style the scrollbar. You can easily customize it as you want! Or even have multiple style on the same page...or just keep the default style ("Mac OS" scrollbar style).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
Lightweight and performant&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only 6kb minified. SimpleBar doesn't use Javascript to handle scrolling. You keep the performances/behaviours of the native scroll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
Supported everywhere&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SimpleBar has been tested on the following browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, IE11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to use SimpleBar…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;htmx allows you to access  &lt;a href="https://htmx.org/docs#ajax" rel="nofollow"&gt;AJAX&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://htmx.org/docs#css_transitions" rel="nofollow"&gt;CSS Transitions&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://htmx.org/docs#websockets" rel="nofollow"&gt;WebSockets&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://htmx.org/docs#sse" rel="nofollow"&gt;Server Sent Events&lt;/a&gt;
directly in HTML, using &lt;a href="https://htmx.org/reference#attributes" rel="nofollow"&gt;attributes&lt;/a&gt;, so you can build
&lt;a href="https://htmx.org/examples" rel="nofollow"&gt;modern user interfaces&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS" rel="nofollow"&gt;simplicity&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;power&lt;/a&gt; of hypertext&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;htmx is small (&lt;a href="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org/dist/" rel="nofollow"&gt;~10k min.gz'd&lt;/a&gt;)

&lt;a href="https://htmx.org/extensions" rel="nofollow"&gt;extendable&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp;
IE11 compatible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
motivation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why should only &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;form&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; be able to make HTTP requests?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why should only &lt;code&gt;click&lt;/code&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;code&gt;submit&lt;/code&gt; events trigger them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why should only GET &amp;amp; POST be available?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why should you only be able to replace the &lt;em&gt;entire&lt;/em&gt; screen?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By removing these arbitrary constraints htmx completes HTML as a
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext" rel="nofollow"&gt;hypertext&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
quick start&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-text-html-basic position-relative js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;  &lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Load from unpkg --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-ent"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;="&lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.4.0&lt;/span&gt;" &lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-ent"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- have a button POST a click via AJAX --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-ent"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;hx-post&lt;/span&gt;="&lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;/clicked&lt;/span&gt;" &lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;hx-swap&lt;/span&gt;="&lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;outerHTML&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    Click Me
  &lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-ent"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt; ( &amp;gt;=14.*)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell position-relative js-code-highlight"&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;//main.js&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-s1"&gt;createApp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;'vue'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-v"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;'./App.vue'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-v"&gt;VuesticPlugin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;'vuestic-ui'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;…
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="gh-btn-container"&gt;&lt;a class="gh-btn" href="https://github.com/epicmaxco/vuestic-ui"&gt;View on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Introduction to Promises in JavaScript.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I promise that you will have a good understanding of promises by the end of the article 😁.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-a-promise"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is a Promise
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A promise in javascript is just like a promise we make in our lives. It refers to an event that will occur in the future.&lt;br&gt;
Promises in javascript are used to handle asynchronous operations. Promises have three possible states -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pending (Initial State)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fulfilled (Successful)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rejected (Failed)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cmHD6qIB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gokowel8p73wuh407x87.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cmHD6qIB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gokowel8p73wuh407x87.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we make a promise, its state will be pending till either it is fulfilled or rejected. If fulfilled, its value will be the value it resolves with, and if it encounters any error, its value will be the value it rejects with (the error object).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, when we make API requests to the server, it immediately returns a promise with &lt;em&gt;pending&lt;/em&gt; state. If the API call is successful, the state of promise changes from &lt;strong&gt;pending&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;fulfilled&lt;/strong&gt;, and if the API request fails, then its state changes from &lt;strong&gt;pending&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;rejected&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promiseExample&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;condition&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;condition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Resolve with Any type of data (objects, arrays, strings, etc...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Error description.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So, we can create a promise by using the &lt;code&gt;new Promise()&lt;/code&gt; constructor. It takes a function as an argument. This function takes two callback functions, &lt;code&gt;resolve&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;reject&lt;/code&gt;. Whenever you want to fulfill the promise, you can call the &lt;code&gt;resolve&lt;/code&gt; callback function and pass the value to it. To reject a promise, call the &lt;code&gt;reject&lt;/code&gt; callback, providing some error message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#using-the-promise"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Using the Promise
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can use the above promise creation example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#then"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  .then()
&lt;/h4&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promiseExample&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;condition&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;condition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Promise Fulfilled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Promise Rejected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;promiseExample&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Promise Fulfilled.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So, the &lt;code&gt;.then()&lt;/code&gt; method takes a callback function that executes whenever the promise resolves (or is fulfilled). The callback itself takes a parameter to store the actual result returned from the promise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;code&gt;.then&lt;/code&gt; also takes a second parameter, a callback function, to handle errors, but there's a better way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#catch"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  .catch()
&lt;/h4&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;promiseExample&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Promise Rejected.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;.catch()&lt;/code&gt; method also takes a callback that executes whenever the promise rejects (or fails). This callback takes an error parameter to catch the error information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#chaining-of-promises"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Chaining of Promises
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose we have to perform multiple asynchronous tasks. In that case, we use promise chaining.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Resolve promise after 1 sec&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promiseExample&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;data of 1st Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;promiseExample&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 1st .then()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dataOfFirstPromise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dataOfFirstPromise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// data of 1st Promise&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// simulating API call which resolves after 1 sec.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;data of 2nd Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 2nd .then()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dataOfSecondPromise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dataOfSecondPromise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// data of 2nd Promise&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Few things to note here - &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;.then()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.catch()&lt;/code&gt; methods always returns a promise so that we can again use &lt;code&gt;.then()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.catch()&lt;/code&gt; on them and chain the promises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the above example, we use two &lt;code&gt;.then()&lt;/code&gt; methods. So, to consume the result of the first &lt;code&gt;.then()&lt;/code&gt; method, we always need to return that value from it. In this case, we &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; a promise from the first &lt;code&gt;.then()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use &lt;code&gt;.catch()&lt;/code&gt; to catch the error if it occurs in any of the promises. This is the main reason we use &lt;code&gt;.catch()&lt;/code&gt; instead of the second parameter of &lt;code&gt;.then()&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;.catch()&lt;/code&gt; method always catches the error either if it occurs in promise or the &lt;code&gt;.then()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above example, we first create a promise which resolves after 1 second. After that, we call &lt;code&gt;.then&lt;/code&gt; on the promise and get the result of the first promise in parameter &lt;code&gt;dataOfFirstPromise&lt;/code&gt;. Now, if we want to fire another API request only after the 1st promise resolves, we can do that here. So we simulate API request with 2nd promise that resolves after 1 second, and we can get the result of 2nd promise in the 2nd &lt;code&gt;.then()&lt;/code&gt; method. You can chain as many &lt;code&gt;.then() 's and&lt;/code&gt;.catch() 's as you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is all about Promise chaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, this was a brief introduction to promises. Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Quasar Brand Refresh and New Partnership</title>
      <author>Razvan Stoenescu</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 28 May 2021 13:35:39 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/quasar/quasar-brand-refresh-and-new-partnership-ao1</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/quasar/quasar-brand-refresh-and-new-partnership-ao1</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of our journey to improve Quasar with each passing day, &lt;strong&gt;we're proud to announce a new partnership with &lt;a href="https://dreamonkey.com/"&gt;Dreamonkey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (who is also an important sponsor of our framework).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Dreamonkey Team will be helping us with the next steps in the evolution of Quasar&lt;/strong&gt; and in particular refreshing its brand and supporting content, which in turn will help everyone better understand what Quasar is, how it works, and how it can benefit you and the company you work for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting everyone to this understanding is not an easy task, as Quasar is not the everyday, run-of-the-mill Vue framework that you often come across. Nope. Quasar not only entails an extensive set of performance-oriented components and directives (the Quasar UI library). It also supplies a massive build architecture (with the Quasar CLI), which will get you and your ideas up and running and building apps in record time. The CLI starts with an awesome development experience and ends with deployment builds for practically any platform (i.e. SPA/SSR - PWA/SSR - Hybrid Mobile with Cordova or Capacitor - Desktop with Electron - and even BEX - Browser Extensions). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We've had this (successful) approach for a few years and we can ensure that all of the parts work together flawlessly and with incredible performance, yet final builds with all of the best practices in modern web development built-in and with the smallest possible package footprint&lt;/strong&gt;. All of our efforts with the CLI allows you to focus on the functionality of your products, instead of the often complex marriage and compatibility of the underlying technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quasar has partnered with Dreamonkey in our endeavor to better express why Quasar is one of the best alternatives to frontend application development out there&lt;/strong&gt;, along with expressing what our core values and principles are. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the great cooperation we have with Dreamonkey, we also have a progressive rollout schedule in place. So stay tuned for lots of exciting new things in the coming weeks. We'll start with an improved logo and brand guide and work our way up to significant improvements to the Quasar docs website, which will help developers learn to use ALL of Quasar's exceptional value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read more about how Dreamonkey designed the new logo and more brand-related insights by reading their &lt;a href="https://dreamonkey.com/en/blog/the-new-official-quasar-logo"&gt;press release article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We have more exciting announcements to make for this quarter&lt;/strong&gt;. Along with the brand updates, we have some interesting times ahead for Quasar and we'd love to take you all with us on our incredible journey to make Quasar the best frontend application framework ever. ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;br&gt;
Razvan Stoenescu, creator and team lead of Quasar Framework&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>5 CSS tricks to improve your project (or just have fun trying) </title>
      <author>Jamie Swift</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 28 May 2021 13:07:21 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/jamieswift90/5-simple-css-tricks-to-improve-your-project-or-just-have-fun-trying-nec</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/jamieswift90/5-simple-css-tricks-to-improve-your-project-or-just-have-fun-trying-nec</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Looking for inspiration on how to add a twist to your project design? Take a look at those 5 CSS techniques and have fun experimenting with some bold ideas! &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#table-of-contents"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Table of Contents
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#backround-clip"&gt;Bring back the 90’s with the background-clip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#clip-path"&gt;Crazy shapes with clip-path&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#selection"&gt;It’s all about the details - change text selection color&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#filter"&gt;Add filters to your images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="#supports"&gt;Check the browser support&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#bring-back-the-90s-with-the-backgroundclip"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Bring back the 90’s with the background-clip &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered how to apply a gradient or a texture to the text in CSS? The good news is you can easily achieve that with the &lt;code&gt;background-clip&lt;/code&gt; property!&lt;br&gt;
First, we need to apply the background color to our &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, then use the value &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; for the &lt;code&gt;background-clip&lt;/code&gt; property and set the text color to transparent.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h1 class="wordart"&amp;gt;The background is clipped to this text&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;h1 { 
     background-color: #ff1493;
     background-image: linear-gradient(319deg, #ff1493 0%, #0000ff 37%, #ff8c00 100%);
}
.wordart {
     -webkit-background-clip: text;
     color: transparent;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And voilà, the 90’ style WordArt is ready!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--a6NWR6zg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6033cf9dce54c65d97d57571/60b0d4be55ffef5042a0f68e_WordArt.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--a6NWR6zg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6033cf9dce54c65d97d57571/60b0d4be55ffef5042a0f68e_WordArt.png" alt="background-clip example"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#crazy-shapes-with-clippath"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Crazy shapes with clip-path &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like to experiment with your designs, you might want to try the &lt;code&gt;clip-path&lt;/code&gt; property. Clip-path creates a clipping region that sets what part of an element should be shown. Anything outside the clip-path (shape’s boundary) won’t be visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--biwwLXkR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6033cf9dce54c65d97d57571/60b0d4beb88c74e7f354074a_Polygon.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--biwwLXkR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6033cf9dce54c65d97d57571/60b0d4beb88c74e7f354074a_Polygon.png" alt="cliped image example"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create this simple polygon I applied &lt;code&gt;.clipped&lt;/code&gt; class on the image and used this path:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;.clipped {
      clip-path: polygon(50% 0, 100% 50%, 50% 100%, 0 50%);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How does it work? Well, the set of two values before a comma are X (horizontal axis) and Y (vertical axis) coordinates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s consider our initial rectangular image. The path (starting from upper right corner where X =0 and Y = 0) would look like this:  &lt;code&gt;(0 0, 100% 0, 100% 100%, 0 100%)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1KQCiDfL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6033cf9dce54c65d97d57571/60b0d4c9d8c5da9d98c7eb07_IMG_4378.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1KQCiDfL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6033cf9dce54c65d97d57571/60b0d4c9d8c5da9d98c7eb07_IMG_4378.jpeg" alt="rectangulatr image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now coming back to our simple polygon - the initial coordinates start exactly in the middle of the X-axis, so that’s why the first pair is X50% and Y0. From there we want to draw a line to the next point which is in the middle of the Y-axis, so what we get is X100% and Y50%. The next line goes from that point to X50% and Y100%, and so on. It can be difficult to wrap your head around it at first, so the best way is to try it yourself and experiment a little! &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#its-all-about-the-details-change-text-selection-color"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  It’s all about the details - change text selection color &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a simple one, but it can add that extra touch to your design. To change the color of the selected text use &lt;code&gt;::selection&lt;/code&gt; pseudo element that will override the browser settings and apply the color you choose.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;::selection {
      background: black;
      color: white;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SxwQ8bt2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6033cf9dce54c65d97d57571/60b0d4bcc9692d855994e650_Selected%2520Text.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SxwQ8bt2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6033cf9dce54c65d97d57571/60b0d4bcc9692d855994e650_Selected%2520Text.png" alt="Selected text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#add-filters-to-your-images"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Add filters to your images &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt; CSS property you can add graphical effects like blur or color shift to an element, for example an image or a background. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below you can see 4 images. First image is the original with no filters applied. The second one is the same pic with the blur effect on it, then goes sepia effect and saturate effect on the last one. Pretty cool, huh?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;.blur {
  filter: blur(5px);
  }

.sepia {
  filter: sepia(75%);
 }

.saturate {
  filter: saturate(10%);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--S2Nn0Lkg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6033cf9dce54c65d97d57571/60b0d4c4e8a72928f1879813_Images%2520with%2520filter%2520on.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--S2Nn0Lkg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6033cf9dce54c65d97d57571/60b0d4c4e8a72928f1879813_Images%2520with%2520filter%2520on.png" alt="Examples of images with filer on"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#check-the-browser-support"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Check the browser support &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s finish off with a handy CSS-rule &lt;code&gt;@supports&lt;/code&gt; that allows you to adjust your declarations for CSS properties depending on browser support. State your condition in the parenthesis - the code will be rendered only if the condition is true. If the browser doesn’t understand a given CSS property the code won’t be generated. You can use &lt;code&gt;@supports not&lt;/code&gt; to provide an alternative CSS (just make sure that the browser supports @supports!)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@supports (display: grid) {
  div {
    display: grid;
  }
}
@supports not (display: grid) {
  div {
    float: left;
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>API requests in React (using fetch)</title>
      <author>Joseph Lynn</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 28 May 2021 13:07:03 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/joelynn/api-requests-in-react-using-fetch-1epl</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/joelynn/api-requests-in-react-using-fetch-1epl</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Often times you will find yourself needing to pull data into your React app. In this tutorial, we will be using the fetch API - a browser API that lets you make network requests. With this API you can send and retrieve data from your own backend or third party API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can checkout the &lt;a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/fetchapi-react-nnfu6"&gt;code sandbox&lt;/a&gt; to see the code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#fetch-api-structure"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Fetch API structure
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use the fetch API for a get request, follow this structure:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/search/pages/results/?andtext=florid&amp;amp;format=json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-add-useeffect-hook"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Add useEffect hook
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's put this into a useEffect hook:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./styles.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/search/pages/results/?andtext=florid&amp;amp;format=json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// make sure to add the empty dependency array, or you will end &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// up in an infinite loop&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-create-simple-state"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Create simple state
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to create 2 pieces of state. One to hold the data we get back from the request and one to toggle the loading state:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// we will use this state to set the data we get back from the &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;newsPapers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setNewsPapers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([]);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// it's good practice to have a loading state - this will help &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// if we want to display a loader component or disable a button &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// to stop users from repeatedly clicking and possibly breaking the application&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isLoading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setIsLoading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-refine-the-fetch-get-request"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Refine the fetch get request
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are missing a couple elements here. We are not handling an error and we need to change the loading state:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./styles.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// we will use this state to set the data we get back from the &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// fetch request&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;newsPapers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setNewsPapers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([]);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// it's good practice to have a loading state - this will help &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// if we want to disable a button to stop users from repeatedly &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// clicking and possibly breaking the application&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isLoading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setIsLoading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// set the loading state to true - since this is a promise, we &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// know this will resolve sometime in the future&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setIsLoading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// to start - use fetch with a url argument&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/search/pages/results/?andtext=florid&amp;amp;format=json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// resolve with a .then() and use the .json() method to &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// extract the JSON body content from the response - &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// otherwise you will just get the HTTP response&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// now the data is in json format, we can use it. Just log &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// the data to see if you get the correct response&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// make sure to catch any error that occurs (just console &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// logging in this case)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// we can use the .finally() handler to set loading to false&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// finally returns a promise, and is called in both cases &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// of fulfilled (successful) or rejected (error)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;finally&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setIsLoading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Fetch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We should see the data coming back from the fetch request. &lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AyUQg7mp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/s3sqmmwaqryisrothv92.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AyUQg7mp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/s3sqmmwaqryisrothv92.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-set-the-data-in-state"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Set the data in state
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's set the data into the newsPapers state:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;      &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// if there is data&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// use the data returned to set the newsPapers state &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setNewsPapers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The data will be set in state now. &lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--otc5uQ_q--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/w0enjrfzsgdfmf2qzhh6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--otc5uQ_q--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/w0enjrfzsgdfmf2qzhh6.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-use-the-data-in-jsx"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Use the data in JSX
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common error is when you try to print out the data &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;There are {newsPapers.items.length} newspapers&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. This will return &lt;code&gt;Cannot read property 'length' of undefined&lt;/code&gt;. Why is that? It breaks because we are trying to render out data that doesn't exist yet. Remember, that fetch is asynchronous, so when we first try to log the data in the JSX, it doesn't exist yet. We can fix this with conditional rendering or using the logical &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; operator:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// logical &amp;amp;&amp;amp; operator &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Fetch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* render newsPapers.items.length only if newsPapers.items exists */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;There&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;newsPapers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;newsPapers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;newspapers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// conditional rendering &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Fetch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* render newsPapers.items.length only if newsPapers.items exists */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;There&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;newsPapers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;newsPapers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;newspapers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You should have a number appear now with no errors. &lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DTrNf5jh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3yuui3k21oml8bepx6ni.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DTrNf5jh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3yuui3k21oml8bepx6ni.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#final-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Final code
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final code with a very simple loader.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./styles.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// we will use this state to set the data we get back from the fetch request&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;newsPapers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setNewsPapers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([]);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// it's good practice to have a loading state - this will help if we want to disable a button to stop users from repeatedly clicking and possibly breaking the application&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isLoading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setIsLoading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// set the loading state to true - since this is a promise, we know this will resolve sometime in the future&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

      <title>Bootstrap 5 Search</title>
      <author>MD Bootstrap</author>

      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-the-bootstrap-search"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is the Bootstrap Search?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The search box is an UI element prepared for creating search engines. Its most important element is search input, but it can also contain icons or buttons. It is also adjusted to be used in various other components such as navbar, dropdown, table, select, sidenav and many more.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installation
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#manual-installation-zip-package"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Manual installation (zip package)
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To take advantage of  our Bootstrap images component and use them in your project, you first need to install the &lt;a href="https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/getting-started/installation/#section-manual-installation"&gt;MDB 5 Free package&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#mdb-cli"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  MDB CLI
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch our &lt;a href="https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/getting-started/quick-start/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quick Start Tutorial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to discover and use the full potential of MDB 5 and MDB CLI&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#npm"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  NPM
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prerequisites"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Prerequisites
&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before starting the project make sure to install &lt;a href="https://nodejs.org/en/"&gt;Node LTS (12.x.x recommended)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installation
&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To install MDB UI KIT in your project easily type the following command in the terminal:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight console"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="go"&gt;npm i mdb-ui-kit 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h6&gt;
  &lt;a href="#importing-js-modules"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Importing JS modules
&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can import the entire library or just individual modules:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight console"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;import * as mdb from 'mdb-ui-kit';&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;// lib
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;import { Input } from 'mdb-ui-kit';&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;// module 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h6&gt;
  &lt;a href="#importing-css-file"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Importing CSS file
&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To import MDB stylesheet please use the following syntax:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight console"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;@import '~mdb-ui-kit/css/mdb.min.css';&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h6&gt;
  &lt;a href="#importing-scss-modules"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Importing SCSS modules
&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also import individual SCSS modules. To do it properly, we recommend to copy them from the node_modules/mdb-ui-kit/src/scss location directly to your project and import in the same way as CSS files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;
  &lt;a href="#webpack-integration"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Webpack integration
&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can significantly speed up the process of creating a new project based on Webpack using our &lt;a href="https://github.com/mdbootstrap/mdb-webpack-starter"&gt;Starter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cdn"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  CDN
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installation via CDN is one of the easiest methods of integrating MDB UI KIT with your project. Just copy the latest compiled JS script tag and CSS link tag from &lt;a href="https://cdnjs.com/libraries/mdb-ui-kit"&gt;cdnjs&lt;/a&gt; to the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't forget to add also Font Awesome and Roboto font if you need it. Here's an example code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;
  &lt;a href="#css"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  CSS
&lt;/h6&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;Font&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;Awesome&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;link&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.1/css/all.min.css"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;rel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;"stylesheet"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;Fonts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;link&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,700&amp;amp;display=swap"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;rel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;"stylesheet"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;MDB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;link&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mdb-ui-kit/3.3.0/mdb.min.css"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;rel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;"stylesheet"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h6&gt;
  &lt;a href="#js"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  JS
&lt;/h6&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;text/javascript&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mdb-ui-kit/3.3.0/mdb.min.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
