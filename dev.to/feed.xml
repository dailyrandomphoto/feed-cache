      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello 👋 I'm 0xaf013c4543a5fc7810e6c7a9. If this looks weird to you I will suggest you to get used to that because that gonna be our new identity, not in this world 🗺 though, beyond this Universe!!!...Yep, you've guessed it right 👉. On METAVERSE (BTW by metaverse i didn't only mean meta's metaverse though but all meatverse, you know what I'm saying 😷)!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I will talk about a Metaverse which is initiated by Decentrology team called Hyperverse. And to disappoint you, this metaverse is not like Facebook's metaverse or Sandbox gaming metaverse. This metaverse is not for general public. This metaverse for the developers who can use the modular contracts to deploy any web3 dapp. I know I'm throwing a lot at you, I'll explain all gradually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, first thing first. First we should know why Web 2 have explosive growth of applications. It's because of APIs. APIs made web 2 very developer friendly to developers. e.g. if you want to add payment getaway in your app, it is unlikely for you to do that from scratch by figuring out the logic. What you will do is you will search for API that fulfill you requirements and paste that one/two lines of code and BOUNCE! That is main stream web 2 development now. Also APIs don't compromise security. So, it's very simple for investors to access APIs a very secure 🔐 way. And it's also easy for developers to build because all tools are free. That is the power of composability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let's see what is going on with web 3. For starters I think 🤔 web 3 is full of frictions. Because smart contract developers are very short supply. The reason behind this is, it requires very high skills to become a successful Smart-Contact developer. And code libraries are broken most of the time ⌚. Because everything is evolving so fast. So, most of the smart contract developers end up developing a large smart contract with various features in it and everything is developed from scratch. Theses types of smart contracts are call Monolithic Smart-Contact (n.b. this termilogy is used by co-founder of Decentrology). Theses large Monolithic Smart-Contacts are very insecure because large codes has more opportunities for bugs. Another huge problem of Smart-Contact is discoverability. Because only identity of a smart contract have is cryptographic hash aka address which defines it's existence on blockchain. So. if you don't have the address of a smart contract that are you looking for, it's most likely that you will never find it from ocean of transaction hash on blockchain because  you can't Google it, unless it's very popular and has been shared on web 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these causes problems for production. So, Decentrology team proposed a solution that leveraging the skills of advanced developer to create a hub/marketplace of modules of Smart-Contacts. Unlike the monolithic smart-contracts, the modular smart-contract will be very simple and primitive that will do one thing very well. Modular smart-contracts will have characteristics of discoverability through manifest metadata on both on-chain and off-chain. So that anybody can find the smart-contract that they need and use it on their system/product. But now question is how you can test the smart-contract is legit or not? Yes there are auditors whose are very experienced advanced smart-contract testers. They will test the smart-contracts. But auditing a smart-contact is very very expensive. So, Decentrology also have solution for that too. They came up 👆 with a model of community of Auditors. The auditors will audit that contract and if they felt that the contact is legitimate then the auditors will stake their tokens as a signed of confidence. This acts as insurance layer for open source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let's see what's Hyperverse is doing all together. It's introducing APTs in Web 3 as Smart Modules. Each smart contract acts as smart module building 🏛 block. So, developers simply have to wired up different blocks in a very intelligent manar. This way any web 2 developer with no/little knowledge of web 3 infrastructure can develop a DApp. This infrastructure unleash the composability from web 2 to web 3. And this is Hyperverse. In a nutshell Hyperverse is a open source decentralize marketplace of composable smart contracts and it is blockchain agnostic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if this is open 🔓 source platform then who will do the management. For this Hyperverse has DAO (Decentralize Autonomous Organization) committee where everyone can participate according to their ability. Experience developer will contribute to hyperverse developing different kinds of modules. In that way they will earn whoever will use their's module. Auditor will verify the modules that have been developed by other developer. They will also earn by staking their token for customer whom they may work for. Hyperverse is in early stage there will be more rules and regulations as the community grows big. The co-founder of Decentrology Nike, have a vision to migrate 10 milion developer from web 2 to web 3. On hypereverse web 3 developers can earn passive income and web 2 developer can create dapp without knowing any complex  architecture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay turn. Next I will run down down their develop modules and also implement my own module. Until then keep the Hype alive. And I'm providing some link 🔗 so that you can research more on hyperverse.&lt;br&gt;

      <title>The Data Stack Journey: Lessons from Architecting Stacks at Heroku and Mattermost</title>
      <author>RudderStack</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 06:35:42 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/rudderstack/the-data-stack-journey-lessons-from-architecting-stacks-at-heroku-and-mattermost-2p4o</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/rudderstack/the-data-stack-journey-lessons-from-architecting-stacks-at-heroku-and-mattermost-2p4o</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our current world is defined by information overload. From your watch tracking your health to your washing machine notifying you when your clothes are done and your phone tracking everything, our personal lives are constantly emitting streams of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's no different for businesses. Many businesses collect the types of product data mentioned above, of course, but that's only one kind of data. Tracking sales leads, marketing journeys and customer experiences is now standard, to name just a few forms of business data. The amount of data produced by your business is immense --- if harnessed properly, it can also be immensely valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, we argue that companies that can leverage this data at scale, are able to understand their businesses better and iterate more quickly. This unique competitive advantage helps them ultimately win in the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, your efforts at implementing the tools and processes required to create value from data aren't static. As your business grows in size and complexity, you iterate to adapt to demands from customers and the market. This changes how you create value from data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We call this process "The Data Stack Journey." This post is meant to guide you in making good foundational decisions that will give you short-term benefit, but reduce or eliminate the all-too-common growing pains that happen as your business and data grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will cover company stages, the core components of the customer data stack, and then dig into Alex's recommendations on which components to use at which stage based on his experience building data stack at companies like Heroku and Mattermost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-data-stack-journey"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Data Stack Journey
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moment your business first provisions a database to store data, you've taken your first step on the Data Stack Journey. Understanding where you are on your journey can help you choose the right data tools for your business. This toolkit will enable you to leverage your data for its maximum impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the Data Stack Journey is the evolution of your data, data tools and processes over time as your business and data grow and change. By choosing the right tools and technologies at the appropriate steps of your Journey, you will be able to maximize the value that you're able to extract from your data while also controlling your spending on tools and resources. Perhaps most importantly, you can make wise decisions early that pay dividends as you grow, helping you avoid migration/integration work and the need for re-architecting for scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#company-stages"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Company Stages
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start by looking at the stages businesses generally go through as they grow, from a small startup to an international enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As companies evolve, so do their data and data technology needs. With each stage of growth comes new challenges and we'll specifically call out targeted advice for each stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Steps&lt;/strong&gt;: You have a small number of customers that you maintain high-touch relationships with. The founders are wearing all the hats and most back-office processes are being done manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seed&lt;/strong&gt;: Your product has gained traction and you're no longer able to personally message every customer. Your business has started to generate revenue and you are quickly iterating the product. This is generally where Seed and Series A stage VC companies are. Most traditional departments, such as Sales, Marketing, etc., are staffed by small (1-3) teams of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growth&lt;/strong&gt;: You've found product-market fit and are aggressively growing your market share. You have thousands (or even more) of customers (the number also depends on the business model). Annual revenue is now in the millions. Your organization is starting to feel growing pains and needs to scale and mature. This is around where most Series B and C companies find themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mature&lt;/strong&gt;: Your business is considered a big player in its market and is considered one of the de-facto choices in your segment. Product iteration tends to be more deliberate and calculated. Optimizing any business metric by even a handful of percentage points could yield millions of dollars of cost savings or revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Grandma has Heard of Them&lt;/strong&gt;: Your business deals with actual "Big Data." We're talking FAANG-level here, where data sizes are in terms of Petabytes. You're building some of your own internal tools to deal with the scale of your data because there aren't off-the-shelf solutions for all of your data needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#data-stack-components"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Data Stack Components
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we've established the high-level stages of companies as they go through the Data Stack Journey, let's take a look at the core components of the data stack. The customer data stack &lt;a href="https://rudderstack.com/blog/the-complete-customer-data-stack/"&gt;is a comprehensive, complex system&lt;/a&gt;, so for this post, we've trimmed the list down the core components at the foundation of the stack that every company needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data warehouse&lt;/strong&gt;: the "center" of the stack, where all of your data is unified and accessible (to teams, tools, apps, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data transformation&lt;/strong&gt;: processing and transformation to ensure your data is usable for downstream functions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data visualization&lt;/strong&gt;: translates data into a usable interface for humans for all kinds of purposes, primarily analytical&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Event stream&lt;/strong&gt;: user behavior data from your websites and apps&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ETL/ELT (tabular)&lt;/strong&gt;: table data from your cloud apps&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reverse-ETL&lt;/strong&gt;: sending data from your warehouse to apps and other destinations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data governance&lt;/strong&gt;: keeping your data clean &amp;amp; compliant across the entire stack&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#data-stack-components-by-stage"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Data Stack Components by Stage
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the rubber meets the road for companies --- deciding which components to use at which stage. (This analysis comes from Alex's experience building and re-building data stacks at various stages at companies like Heroku and Mattermost.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#data-warehouse"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Data Warehouse
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Step and Seed&lt;/strong&gt;: You most likely can just query your production database, though I would recommend using a read replica/follower. I would say you can run dbt against your production database but I'd be very careful and might just skip dbt altogether until you can get a database for analytics only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a while, you should be able to get away with using a Postgres database as your data warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growth and larger&lt;/strong&gt;: Once you get to a certain size, you'll most likely be looking for a proper data warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top three players at the moment are Google's BigQuery, Amazon Redshift, and Snowflake. I personally put Snowflake and BigQuery as 1a and 1b.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  BigQuery has capabilities for streaming data into your warehouse very quickly (e.g. a handful of seconds to get certain sources of data queryable).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  I find Snowflake to be the easiest to use, with a more conventional database permission system. Also being able to control the amount of compute power by controlling the size of your "Virtual Warehouse" makes it easy to run your big beefy jobs in a decent runtime. It also has interesting features like Snowpipe for pulling data into the warehouse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With both BigQuery and Snowflake, you need to keep an eye on costs as you're generally paying for how many compute resources you are consuming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Redshift is great but is more like a traditional database system to run. The benefit to Redshift is that you're just paying a flat amount regardless of how much you do with it. You have to spend more time on database administration tasks, however, such as optimizing column encodings, sort keys, and distribution keys. Also, your compute power isn't separate from your storage. So if you just need more storage, you have to add more nodes to your cluster, even if you don't necessarily want to pay for more compute power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#data-transformation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Data Transformation
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one and only &lt;a href="https://www.getdbt.com/"&gt;dbt&lt;/a&gt;. This the one tool I'd recommend for companies of &lt;em&gt;any size&lt;/em&gt;. It provides a framework for transforming the data as part of your ELT process. With dbt, you define your raw data sources and build models in SQL-like templates and then build models that reference other models. Because you've now defined a hierarchy of models, dbt can now build your models appropriately based on the graph of models you've built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dbt will then automatically generate a docs site that allows you to visualize the lineage graph of your models and raw data sources. This can really help with onboarding new analysts and data engineers by giving them an easy way to explore how the data is modeled and its lineage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.getdbt.com/signup/"&gt;Dbt Cloud&lt;/a&gt; is a $50/mo/developer user with unlimited "view-only" users. You can also run dbt yourself through a tool like Airflow. In most cases, I'd start with dbt Cloud since the operational burden of running Airflow yourself could be more than it's worth, especially if you're just using it to run dbt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#data-visualization"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Data Visualization
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For First Step and Seed, I'd recommend &lt;a href="https://www.metabase.com/"&gt;Metabase&lt;/a&gt;. This provides data visualization that won't break the bank. For future scalability and maintainability, I'd recommend leveraging dbt to build models that can answer most questions with simple SQL queries. By putting most of the complexity in your dbt models, you ensure that users can't get themselves into trouble by incorrectly writing SQL. This also allows you to have more portability if you choose to move to a different visualization platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pricing for Metabase can be as low as $100/mo if you use their cloud service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Growth and larger, I would recommend &lt;a href="https://looker.com/"&gt;Looker&lt;/a&gt;. The only reason I wouldn't recommend it for the smaller company stages is that the cost is much higher than alternatives such as Metabase. With Looker, you define your data model in &lt;a href="https://docs.looker.com/data-modeling/learning-lookml/what-is-lookml/"&gt;LookML&lt;/a&gt;, which Looker then uses to provide a drag-and-drop interface for end-users that enables them to build their own visualizations without needing to write SQL. This lets your analytics team scale by not getting bogged down answering one-off questions from end-users or having to build every chart or graph that your users need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#event-stream"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Event Stream
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are really only two choices here --- Segment and RudderStack. They are both affordable in the First Step and Seed Stages, but &lt;a href="https://rudderstack.com/?utm_content=inline-mention/"&gt;RudderStack&lt;/a&gt; scales much better through the Growth, Mature, and Enterprise phases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Segment&lt;/strong&gt;: Segment is a mature product with a heavy lean towards marketing and now revenue operations users. While Segment will sync your data to your data warehouse, a lot of features are restricted to only use data that is in Segment itself. This means it's difficult to unlock the real power of your data. Also, with MTU-based pricing, you can be forced into situations where you're trying to determine if implementing new telemetry is worth the cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RudderStack&lt;/strong&gt;: RudderStack doesn't store any data (they enable you to build a CDP on your own warehouse) and their event stream capabilities are as good or better than Segment. Also, they offer Cloud Extract (ELT) and Warehouse Actions (reverse-ETL), meaning you don't have to manage your event stream separately from your other pipelines. Lastly, because they are open source, there's no vendor lock-in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#data-governance"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Data Governance
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is closely related to the transformations component we covered above, so we don't need to go into a ton of detail. Ultimately, you need to bake data governance into the stack from the beginning and dbt/Looker are the tools for the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Steps and Seed&lt;/strong&gt;: With dbt, you can hide the complexity of transforming raw data into usable models and also ensure that internal users are only looking at data from the vetted dbt models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growth and larger&lt;/strong&gt;: With the combination of dbt and Looker, you can maintain good data governance. Looker gives you the platform to let you unify the definitions of business metrics so that everyone is playing off the same sheet of music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#etlelt-tabular"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ETL/ELT (Tabular)
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ETL/ELT solutions for getting tabular data from your cloud tools to your warehouse are becoming commoditized and that functionality is now ubiquitous among data stacks. There are various options and some up-and-comers to keep an eye out for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pipelinewise&lt;/strong&gt;: An open-source framework for running Singer.io taps and targets. It's relatively easy to run yourself and can get you started with ETL. Recommended for First Steps and Seed (but you can use it as just an additional tool since it's pretty straightforward to use).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stitchdata&lt;/strong&gt;: A SaaS product that also runs Singer.io taps and targets. The UX is relatively straightforward, though there are some rough edges and you can't use cron style scheduling unless you purchase their enterprise plan. The pricing is based purely on the number of rows synced and generally is not very expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FiveTran&lt;/strong&gt;: This is the premium product in this space with a polished UX, but also comes with a higher cost. They also have a pricing plan based on "monthly active rows" which can make it a little more challenging to calculate. Recommended for Growth or larger companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RudderStack Cloud Extract&lt;/strong&gt;: With Cloud Extract, you can pull data out of sources and into your warehouse. Because it's integrated with the rest of the RudderStack product, it is easier to manage without having tons of different tools you have to log into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Airbyte&lt;/strong&gt;: This is a newcomer to the space and is open source. They are looking to move away from Singer.io formats and are also looking to integrate better with dbt. Keep an eye on this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#reverseetl"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Reverse-ETL
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enriching data in your business systems from your data warehouse is becoming increasingly important. The key is to ensure that each business system is getting populated with accurate data. This also allows for the various teams in your company to work with the technologies they are familiar with without having to jump between a bunch of different systems. For instance, enriching lead information in your CRM with product usage data can help your sales reps engage with customers better and lead to more conversions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reverse-ETL can also be instrumental in helping to automate and make business processes more efficient. There are a lot of competitors in this space and the dust hasn't yet settled on which is the premier solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Census&lt;/strong&gt;: As of this writing, Census is one of the more mature products in this space. Don't underestimate how much a good UX helps to drive adoption within an organization. The default pricing model is per connector without charging extra per volume. If your organization syncs a ton of data to one destination, this could be the solution for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hightouch&lt;/strong&gt;: This product is developing quickly. One interesting feature is their &lt;a href="https://docs.hightouch.io/hightouch-with-dbt/git-sync-for-dbt/"&gt;Git sync for dbt&lt;/a&gt; which gives you "configuration-as-code" which will help with scalability and maintainability. Their pricing is based on the volume of &lt;em&gt;unique&lt;/em&gt; records synced to any number of destinations. This could be the solution for you if you're looking to sync a relatively smaller number of records to a lot of different destinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polytomic&lt;/strong&gt;: This product is a new entrant into the space and they have a couple of interesting twists. One is that they don't write to the data source that they're pulling data from, which means you can hook it up to a read-only replica without issue. Also, they can join together data from a variety of sources, including Google Sheets, and push the combined data to a variety of sources. If you're in the early stages of your Data Stack Journey this is definitely worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RudderStack Warehouse Actions&lt;/strong&gt;: With RudderStack's warehouse-first architecture, it dovetails nicely into using your Warehouse to send data to other sources. This feature is still developing but looks promising and keeps you from having "Yet Another Tool" if you have relatively straightforward reverse-ETL needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#only-you-can-prevent-a-messy-stack"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Only You Can Prevent a Messy Stack
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a great time to be a data engineer architecting a customer data stack. The tools available allow you to build from the data layer up with your warehouse as the center, giving you, ultimately, flexibility and scalability. Perhaps the best news is that there are tools like dbt and RudderStack that will scale with you from your first steps through becoming an enterprise company, drastically simplifying your work on the stack and giving you the ability to focus on your product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, though, tools are only the conduit: the best companies make data itself a first-class citizen in the organization and invest time upfront in data modeling, transformations, and governance to ensure that no matter which tools are used, data stays clean and usable through every stage of growth.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Advent of Code 2021 Python Solution: Day 9</title>
      <author>Viper</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 06:34:20 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/qviper/advent-of-code-2021-python-solution-day-9-4amm</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/qviper/advent-of-code-2021-python-solution-day-9-4amm</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;First part was not much harder to crack but it still took plenty of time. But second part was tricky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#part-1"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Part 1
&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Part 2
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I had to use some sort of Searching algorithm like DFS or BFS but I found a solution on StackOverflow using NumPy.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;scipy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ndimage&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;num_label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ndimage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bincount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ravel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;top3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;sorted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;reverse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)[:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;prod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;top3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Identity Resolution is More Valuable When it’s on Your Warehouse</title>
      <author>RudderStack</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/rudderstack/identity-resolution-is-more-valuable-when-its-on-your-warehouse-40pe</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Identity resolution lets you combine unique identifiers across your digital touchpoints to identify users in real-time. With it, you can create a unified, omnichannel view of your customers. By leveraging an identity graph - a database that houses these identifiers - you can identify and connect details related to different aspects of your customers' journeys and stitch them all together in one customer profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#rudderstack-builds-your-identity-graph-on-your-data-warehouse-other-customer-data-tools-dont"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  RudderStack Builds Your Identity Graph on Your Data Warehouse. Other Customer Data Tools Don't.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many customer data tools offer identity resolution, they build and store these identity graphs in their CDP tool infrastructure. To the user, building the identity graph is opaque, and the data that composes the identity graph is unknown. RudderStack doesn't do any of that black-box magic, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of RudderStack's most prominent features is its warehouse-first architecture. RudderStack treats your data warehouse as a first-class citizen. So you can send all your cross-platform data to your warehouse in real-time. More importantly, RudderStack lets you build important data structures - like your identity graph - in your data warehouse. This means you can leverage all the cross-platform customer data residing in your warehouse to stitch together comprehensive user profiles using the identity graph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-businesses-use-identity-resolution"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How Businesses use Identity Resolution
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we jump into the advantages of performing identity resolution on your warehoused customer data, let's take a quick look at how companies leverage identity resolution in traditional CDP tools - ones that store your identity graph on their infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#crossdevice-identity-stitching"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cross-Device Identity Stitching
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a user may use one browser on a particular device for all their work-related activities, they may use another device or browser for their personal tasks. User behavior differs between devices, browsers, and even the time of day. Your sites and applications generate data that you can use to derive valuable, detailed insights such as what users are more likely to do in their free time, what their search history looks like on their tablet, and so much more. Combining all of this information lets businesses get a complete picture of who the consumer is on more than one device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By connecting different unique identifiers across platforms and devices in real-time, businesses can enable efficient targeting and personalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#realtime-identification-of-users-in-downstream-tools"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Real-Time Identification of Users in Downstream Tools
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses often collect event data from multiple, disparate digital properties and stream that data to downstream tools. Identity resolution allows them to link together all the user IDs and the anonymous IDs - IDs assigned to a user before they login or if they don't log in - across digital properties for a given user. This process involves combining a user's device ID, offline ID, cookie information, etc., into a single anonymous identifier, allowing brands to identify unique users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By leveraging the identity graph residing in a data warehouse, you can easily identify, aggregate, and unify customer profiles from various data silos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#building-and-activating-segmented-audiences-inside-the-cdp"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Building and Activating Segmented Audiences Inside the CDP
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identity resolution lets marketers de-duplicate unique users and also monitor their entire customer journey across all digital touchpoints. It also allows them to build behavior-based cohorts depending on the customer's product interaction between user sessions and devices, as well as various real-time traits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use these audiences for various downstream activation use-cases, such as analytics, spend optimization, targeted marketing, personalized messaging, cutting-edge customer support, and delivering unique customer experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#additional-benefits-of-building-your-identity-graph-on-your-data-warehouse"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Additional Benefits of Building Your Identity Graph on Your Data Warehouse
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you build your identity graph on a data warehouse, you get all the advantages of traditional identity resolution plus more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#easier-more-scalable-crossdevice-identity-stitching"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Easier, More Scalable Cross-Device Identity Stitching
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In modern, digital businesses, the graph used for cross-device identity stitching can be quite large - consisting of tens or even hundreds of millions of nodes. This number keeps scaling rapidly as you gather more data across different touchpoints. In such a scenario, storing the identity graph on your data warehouse - and not on the CDP infrastructure - makes a lot of sense. Cloud data warehouses are infinitely scalable, and data storage is cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RudderStack lets you achieve efficient and seamless identity mapping in your data warehouse. It does this by storing the graph on the warehouse as a table, associating a virtual ID with all the device IDs (user or anonymous ID), and mapping the association between them. It builds the identity graph for all of your event data and updates it continuously as new event data comes into your warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Enrichment of Your Identity Graph with Data from Non-Event Tools
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from your customer event data, your warehouse also stores data from different non-event tools like CRM and customer support platforms, email marketing and advertising tools, analytics platforms, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An identity graph built on your warehouse can leverage all of this data to stitch together a more comprehensive, enriched user profile, giving you a more accurate and real-time view of your customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An enriched identity graph built on your warehouse also lets you build more effective user cohorts by bringing together information from various event and non-event tools - all in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating a Unified Customer Profile
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your data warehouse is the single source of truth for your customers, it only makes sense to have your identity graph built on top of this warehoused data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With RudderStack, you can build a customer identity graph that leverages your enriched warehoused data in real-time to provide a single, unified view of all your customers. It links identifiers such as device IDs, cookies, email addresses, IP addresses, etc., to a known or anonymous profile while following the required privacy-compliant methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can then leverage this rich identity graph to enable identity resolution and get a complete, 360-degree view of your customers. You can also use the identity graph to implement other use-cases such as lead scoring, creating custom cohorts and audience segments for your personalization use cases, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to Aaron Pretto Vopni, there is a still consensus on whether medicinal mushrooms are an acceptable and legal form of treatment of ADHD. Medicinal mushrooms are when the harvested mushrooms are converted into medicines for treating diseases or illnesses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Know with Aaron Pretto Vopni, what is ADHD &amp;amp; medical mushrooms, and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://getjoys.net/health/medicinal-mushrooms-adhd"&gt;how medicinal mushrooms can treat people suffering from ADHD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Hello Devs, if you want to become a React developer or just want to learn React.js to complete frontend tasks and looking for the best websites to learn React in 2022 then you have come to the right place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier, I have shared the &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/08/top-5-react-js-and-redux-courses-to-learn-online.html"&gt;best React.js courses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.java67.com/2020/03/top-5-books-to-learn-reactjs-for-beginners.html"&gt;books&lt;/a&gt;, and a complete &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/10/the-2018-react-developer-roadmap.html"&gt;React.js Developer RoadMap&lt;/a&gt;, and today, I am going to share the best websites and online platforms to learn React JS in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://reactjs.org/"&gt;React.js&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most popular front-end development libraries and it's used heavily by all kinds of companies, both big and small, both startups and investment banks etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a lot of demand for React.js developers as there are not many developers who understand React and create React components and React.js based applications.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just looked at the React jobs on Indeed and more than 30K React.js jobs are available. I bet the actual number is a lot more than that and that's why &lt;a href="https://javinpaul.medium.com/top-5-courses-to-learn-react-js-in-2019-best-of-lot-fa02cd96cdf0"&gt;learning React.js&lt;/a&gt; can be a game-changer for your career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't know,  React.js is a &lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/10-javascript-frameworks-and-libraries-to-learn-in-2020-best-of-lot-5f61f86c60b4"&gt;JavaScript library&lt;/a&gt; and open-source created by the Facebook development team used for building the UI or user interface for the front-end website and make the interaction with your website so simple such as a single page application a mobile application, and dynamic components like the search bar is a component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the front-end pages actually contain many files such as &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/05/top-5-html-5-and-css-3-courses-for-web-developers.html"&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/09/top-5-css-cascading-style-sheet-courses-for-beginners.html"&gt;CSS&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/06/top-10-courses-to-learn-javascript-in.html"&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; and maybe more than that but with React you can combine all of that work in one file and making the website load much speedy and also instead of rendering the whole page when you click on some component you actually render that component only so that makes it more powerful in terms of visual and losing speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this small introductory about React.js, and now that you have some basic understanding of what is this library and what makes it useful compared to the other libraries and by complete reading the article, let's jump into the best websites and online platforms to learn React.js in 2022 from scratch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;btw, if you are in hurry the just join Acadmind and Maximillian Scwarzmuller's &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Freact-the-complete-guide-incl-redux%2F"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;React --- The Complete Guide&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; course on Udemy and you won't regret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Freact-the-complete-guide-incl-redux%2F"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ltAUfXla--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://process.fs.teachablecdn.com/ADNupMnWyR7kCWRvm76Laz/resize%3Dwidth:705/https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/zRE6jb1GS0eMC8zAD9Fe" alt="best sites and courses to learn Reactjs" width="705" height="397"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="#10-best-platforms-to-learn-reactjs-online-in-2022"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  10 Best Platforms to Learn React.js Online in 2022
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the best places to learn React.js in 2022 I have handpicked these online React.js resources with a couple of React and JavaScript experts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have purposefully chosen as few resources as possible, mainly to avoid confusion, but still with some options. I have also tried to include both free and paid React.js resources for better learning options. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just in case if you have any other useful React websites which teach React development then feel free to suggest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-react-official-website"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. &lt;a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html"&gt;React (Official Website)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always learning any kind of programming language or framework from the official documentation is a good idea since it was written by the professional who has created or developed that technology so it covers every aspect and almost no mistake in their tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start by installing the environment like adding the react to your website and start your very first Hello World example then rendering elements and components and much more advanced techniques such as optimizing the performance building your own Hooks and much more you will explore inside the documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--e9cRAWuB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://reactjs.org/static/9381f09e609723a8bb6e4ba1a7713b46/90cbd/thinking-in-react-components.png" alt="best website to learn React.js in 2022" width="605" height="391"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-udemy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourses%2Fsearch%2F%3Fq%3Dreact%26src%3Dsac%26kw%3DReact"&gt;Udemy&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the best platforms that I suggest people take a look at and learn from their thousands of free online courses in different industries from marketing to business and technology and various &lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/7-best-programming-language-you-can-learn-to-boost-your-salary-3d3790b1e6a6"&gt;programming languages&lt;/a&gt; and React is one of them and there are more than three thousand courses only for this topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you search Udemy you will find a lot of free React js courses but not all of them are good, some of them are very short and some of them are not up-to-date, but there are still many &lt;em&gt;free React courses&lt;/em&gt; that are worth joining like the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Freact-tutorial%2F"&gt;React JS Frontend Web Development for Beginners&lt;/a&gt; which is an up-to-date React course and intended to teach you the basics of Hooks and working with API and some other small features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, when it comes to picking the best React course, I highly recommend to checkout &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Freact-the-complete-guide-incl-redux%2F"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;React --- The Complete Guide&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Maximillian Scwarzmuller. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Freact-tutorial%2F"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tc-Wz1_z--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jSjG6avrD6g/X3vN6wt6LkI/AAAAAAAAjsA/DoOFO40rHPIU23D2lGA4iwISJXFcKllaQCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h264/undraw_react_y7wq.png" alt="Top 5 Websites to Learn React JS in 2022" width="400" height="264"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This React.js course is not free but one of the biggest courses intended to help you build an amazing and useful React application such as single page application and learning advanced Redux routing deploying the app and more.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-coursera"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=40328&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fsearch%3Fquery%3DReact%26"&gt;Coursera&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coursera is another great platform that offers online courses, specialization, online degrees, and professional courses created by the top tech companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft etc, and top universities around the world as well as organizations in different industries such as data science and programming, and React.js.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with the best course for React called &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=40328&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Flearn%2Ffront-end-react"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Front-End Web Development with React&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and will teach you its component and JSX then move to some advanced concepts such as React routing and designing a single page application and the flow architecture and Redux creating client-server communication and how to use the REST API and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course or should I say a collection of courses because it's a Coursera specialization is offered by the University of Hong Kong. Like other Coursera courses, you can audit the course for free, which means you can watch them but you won't get access to certificates and assessments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want a certificate then you can either enroll in the specialization or join the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=40328&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fcourseraplus"&gt;Coursera Plus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a subscription plan from Coursera which gives unlimited access to more than 3000+ Coursera resources including Professional certification from Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=40328&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Flearn%2Ffront-end-react"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8CIluFtr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-h7nryHwhfkA/X3vQcMdJQBI/AAAAAAAAjsY/pXLgKrQD8EsEAnWaG-Lltf3XrmJnG5BYQCLcBGAsYHQ/w395-h220/Front-End%252BWeb%252BDevelopment%252Bwith%252BReact%252BCoursera%252Bbest%252Bcourse.png" alt="Best Coursera course to learn React.js" width="395" height="219"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-freecodecamp"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. &lt;a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/search/?query=react"&gt;freeCodeCamp&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;freeCodeCamp is a non-profits organization that has more than six thousand tutorials about technology and programming on their websites and YouTube channels and their graduates have got a good job after graduating and taking the courses offered by them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many good resources to learn React.js on freeCodeCamp and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgwI22y_eFA"&gt;Build an Online Store&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best projects that you can see to learn how to use React and other technology combining them to create a useful project and deploy it in amazon web service AWS and adding some features such as strip payment to be a complete store created from scratch in one video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-react-courses-for-web-developers.html"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--D91LSDnW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-41HPKw2Rrt8/X3vR4XqMItI/AAAAAAAAjs0/FiYvwF9too8UzueqhVyfRqUAJZTIMjY9wCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h225/Build%252Ban%252BOnline%252BStore%252BReact%252BAWS%252Band%252BStripe%252BCourse%252BFreeCodecamp.png" alt="best free react courses for beginners" width="400" height="225"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-alterclass"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. &lt;a href="https://www.alterclass.io/courses/react?ref=5ef9b5f324fba57c45713ca0"&gt;AlterClass&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another good website to learn Reactjs online. It has one of the best paid online React courses which covers everything you need to know to become a React expert but you may not know that it also has a free module where you can learn React Fundamentals for FREE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.alterclass.io/courses/react?ref=5ef9b5f324fba57c45713ca0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;React Fundamentals course&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Alterclass is completely FREE and good enough to learn the basics of React.js frameworks like props, state management, and JSX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course is taught by Greg D'Angelo, a senior software engineer and mentor specializing in teaching React, &lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/my-favorite-free-tutorials-and-courses-to-learn-javascript-8f4d0a71faf2"&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;, and much more. He has been working with React, Node, and MongoDB for the last few years to build large-scale production applications in a wide range of industries&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.alterclass.io/courses/react?ref=5ef9b5f324fba57c45713ca0"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cxjQIFKO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5RJKIsdBkHA/X3vP5t5fHNI/AAAAAAAAjsQ/rAQ0YzgONaI306XB2Lq4VLpNgXYT90gowCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h225/React%252BFundamentals%252Bcourse%252Bby%252BAlterClass%252BFREE.png" alt="best free website and online course to learn React.js" width="400" height="225"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-pluralsight"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. &lt;a href="https://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1193463/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Flearn"&gt;Pluralsight&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pluralsight is another e-Learning website or platform that has thousands of classes created by professional instructor since this website restrict anybody from teaching if he does not have the skills that he offers to people and one of the courses out there is React.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to learning to React on Pluralsight, &lt;a href="https://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1193463/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Fcourses%2Freact-redux-react-router-es6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building Applications with React and Redux&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the best course intended to be for intermediate people who have some basic understanding of JavaScript and React to build React applications using modern technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you are not intermediate and you want to learn the basics then you should see this &lt;a href="https://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1193463/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Fcourses%2Freact-big-picture"&gt;React: The Big Picture&lt;/a&gt; course targeted the beginner who is just starting their career in React.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, you would need a &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1193463/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Flearn"&gt;Pluralsight membership&lt;/a&gt; to join this React course which costs around $29 per month or $299 per year (14% discount). I highly recommend this subscription to all programmers as it provides instant access to more than 7000+ online courses to learn any tech skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are run 40% off sale every quarter where you can get their annual membership for just $149 per year, which is like $12 per month.  Alternatively, you can also use their &lt;a href="https://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1193463/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Flearn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10-day-free-trial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to watch this React course for FREE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1193463/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Flearn"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SXF9KP4g--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7QFNem19hj4/X3vRQoZYLlI/AAAAAAAAjss/HN7Sp0DhpT4hHkvtAQvB2V6spiFJ6moFwCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h225/Screenshot_2020-08-15%252BBuilding%252BApplications%252Bwith%252BReact%252Band%252BFlux%252BPluralsight%2525282%252529.png" alt="best platforms to learn React.js for Beginners" width="400" height="225"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="#7-learn-react-for-free-updated-on-scrimba"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  7. &lt;a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact"&gt;Learn React for free (updated) on Scrimba&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#10-codecademy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  10. &lt;a href="https://bit.ly/codecademyhome"&gt;Codecademy&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another website where I go to learn new skills and in the past I have learned Java, Linux command line, Python, and JavaScript in this interactive website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is similar to freeCodecamp but much more smooth and well designed. Their bite size lesson and interactive practice and feedback help you to quickly learn React.js. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also have a free React course called &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pntrs.com/t/TUJGR0lLR0JHRklJSkhCR0ZISk1N?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.codecademy.com%2Flearn%2Freact-101"&gt;learn React&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; which will teach you essential React’s concepts like JSX, class and function components, props, state, lifecycle methods, and hooks for free. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll be able to combine these ideas in React’s modular programming style. They also have a another course on Redux called &lt;a href="https://www.pjatr.com/t/TUJGR0lLR0JHRklJSkhCR0ZISk1N?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.codecademy.com%2Flearn%2Flearn-redux"&gt;Learn Redux&lt;/a&gt; as well some projects which you can build to learn React better, my favorite one is Random Color Picker&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said, CodeCademy ahs both free and paid React.js courses, Learn React is free but if you need certification then you need to join &lt;a href="https://bit.ly/codecademypro"&gt;CodeCademy Pro&lt;/a&gt; which gives access to all of their courses and projects. It cost around $15.99 per month and provides access to all the CodeCademy premium content, courses, quizzes, and projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pntrs.com/t/TUJGR0lLR0JHRklJSkhCR0ZISk1N?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.codecademy.com%2Flearn%2Freact-101"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JOHMbIDG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/content/images/2021/09/What-is-React-.png" alt="Best places to learn React.js for free" width="880" height="370"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;That's all about the &lt;strong&gt;10 Best websites to learn React.js in 2022.&lt;/strong&gt; You can join any of these websites and online course platforms to learn Reactjs from scratch. If you want to learn React for free then I suggest learning from their official websites and freecodecamp, and joining these &lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/top-10-free-courses-to-learn-react-js-c14edbd3b35f"&gt;free React.js courses&lt;/a&gt; from Udemy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React.js helps you to create a good user interface for you websites or mobile apps because they gave them a competitive advantage and make the digital interaction for users more easy and simple and that will acquire them more clients and profits and that can be possible with a JavaScript library called React.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What's new in React 18?
</title>
      <author>ashikarose</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 05:54:22 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/ashikarose/whats-new-in-react-18-3908</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/ashikarose/whats-new-in-react-18-3908</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;React's latest version was recently released, featuring a number of out-of-the-box changes as well as a new concurrent rendering opt-in method. The new version emphasizes a progressive adoption strategy, which means you may upgrade to React 18 with no or minor code modifications. That's quite a feat. Isn't that so?&lt;br&gt;
But, before we get into the new features, there's something you should be aware of: the React 18 Working Group (WG). The purpose of this group, which was introduced for the first time in React development, is to prepare the ecosystem for the gradual and smooth adoption of the future version by leveraging existing applications and frameworks. The talks are open to the public on &lt;a href="%E2%80%9Dhttps://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/112%22" rel="nofollow"&gt;Github Discussions&lt;/a&gt;, and all material is available at the aforementioned website. The most remarkable aspect of this new version is that it makes us feel like we're a part of the research process for future new features. As you've probably noticed, React 18 has a lot to offer, so let's jump right in and have some fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install React 18 by following these steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;npm install react@alpha&lt;br&gt;
And ReactDOM,&lt;br&gt;
npm install react-dom@alpha&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What's New in React 18?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1.The new root API:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We normally add the React App to a Root level DOM level like this. This has been deprecated and replaced by the "Legacy Root API."&lt;br&gt;
import React from 'react';&lt;br&gt;
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';&lt;br&gt;
const container = document.getElementById('root') &lt;br&gt;
ReactDOM.render(, container);&lt;br&gt;
Instead, a new Root API is introduced in React18, which looks like this :&lt;br&gt;
import React from 'react';&lt;br&gt;
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';&lt;br&gt;
import App from 'App'&lt;br&gt;
const container = document.getEleementById('root')&lt;br&gt;
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(container)&lt;br&gt;
root.render()&lt;br&gt;
To ensure a smooth transition from React 17(or older) to React 18, &lt;a href="%E2%80%9Dhttps://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/4%22" rel="nofollow"&gt;React 18&lt;/a&gt; will ship with both the Legacy Root API and the New Root API.&lt;br&gt;
**2.startTransition API:&lt;br&gt;
**This is a new API introduced with this release that aids in maintaining the current webpage's responsiveness while also allowing for massive non-blocking UI modifications.&lt;br&gt;
When a user begins typing in a search box, one key use case for startTransition could be. The input value must be updated quickly, whereas the search results may be delayed for a few moments (as expected by the user).&lt;br&gt;
This API allows you to distinguish between immediate and delayed updates. Transition Updates are the delayed updates (i.e. the transition from one UI display to another).&lt;br&gt;
We call props/functions like this for urgent updates like typing, hovering, and clicking:&lt;br&gt;
setText(input)&lt;br&gt;
We can wrap it in a &lt;a href="%E2%80%9Dhttps://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/41%E2%80%9D" rel="nofollow"&gt; startTransition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 API for non-urgent or large UI updates as:&lt;br&gt;
startTransition(() =&amp;gt; {&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;setText(input);&lt;br&gt;
});&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;3.Strict Effects will be added to Strict Mode:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
React18 will ship  along with Strict Effects Mode now. Just like Strict Mode, this would be for development builds and improved DX.&lt;br&gt;
When a component is wrapped in Strict Effects, React ensures that side-effects are "intentionally" run twice to detect unexpected behavior/patterns, which is typically a pain point when working with useEffect mounting and cleaning procedures.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4.Suspense List:&lt;br&gt;
**Another concurrent React 18 feature that "orchestrates" the appearance of heavy data fetched components on the screen.&lt;br&gt;
A  takes in revealOrder prop with values forward, backward or together&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
  }&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  }&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
In this case, the card component will be revealed from the front (until the data is fetched, will fall back to LoadingSpinner Component). backwards reveals Cards in reverse order, while the combined prop renders everything "together."&lt;br&gt;
**5.SSR improvements:&lt;br&gt;
**The architecture of Server-Side Rendering has been overhauled in this release, with improvements to the first loading screen time. SSR had to load the complete page in the simple version (before React 17) before it could begin hydrating the page.&lt;br&gt;
This changes in React18, now we can break React components into smaller chunks using .&lt;br&gt;
This is now called selective hydration.Wrapping a component now will begin hydrating the very specific component once the code has been loaded and it does not block the rest of the page, assuming we have 4 - 5 separate components on the screen. This method allows more critical parts/components of the page to become interactive first (even if the connection is extremely poor), while other components continue to hydrate and provide a nice user experience.&lt;br&gt;
Here, the  component won't be resolved until the data is fetched, till then the component will fall back to .&lt;br&gt;
We can use  for several components fetching data at different times keeping important components interactive.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
  }&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
**6.useDefferedValue:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
useDefferedValue takes a state value and a millisecond timeout, then returns a "deferred version" of that value. This value is delayed by the timeout seconds specified.&lt;br&gt;
const deferredValue = useDeferredValue(value, { timeoutMs: 3000 });&lt;br&gt;
This could be a scenario when a text input field would be useful.The text input would be immediately rendered to the screen however the  text props takes in a useDeferredValue and returns a defferedText which lags by 3 seconds. As a result, the Card Lists component is delayed while the text field remains responsive to users.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Because the application and library authors may have a smooth transition and not any breaking changes, React18 has focused on concurrent capabilities rather than a full-fledged concurrent mode (which has been heavily advertised since React16).&lt;br&gt;
Because React18 is still in alpha and not ready for production, APIs may change until it reaches a stable release before the end of the year (expected). This brings us to the end of our React18 post.We are quite excited, as a leading &lt;a href="https://www.cronj.com/react/react-development-agency" rel="nofollow"&gt;react agency&lt;/a&gt;, and we know you are as well! So, folks, stay tuned to learn about the latest developments.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Create a Balance Reminder with Vonage Account API and Google Apps</title>
      <author>Ravgeet Dhillon</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 05:06:28 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/ravgeetdhillon/create-a-balance-reminder-with-vonage-account-api-and-google-apps-1pl5</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/ravgeetdhillon/create-a-balance-reminder-with-vonage-account-api-and-google-apps-1pl5</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Being a freelancer, I have helped a couple of local businesses in India implement Vonage products. Recently, one of my clients asked if they can get a reminder email when the Vonage balance is below a specified limit as they don't want to hamper their operations because of insufficient balance. Almost all of my clients use Google Workspace, so I decided to create an integration of Vonage and Google Apps Script to create this workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Apps Script allows us to manage all of Google apps using one platform in the cloud. The best part is that the authentication is baked into the platforms and many businesses in the market use Google Workspace – formerly known as G-Suite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, you'll learn how to create custom notifications when your Vonage Account balance is below a specified limit. The post is aimed at those Vonage developers who want to manage their client base effectively by sending them reminders about the Vonage Account balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read the full blog on &lt;a href="https://learn.vonage.com/blog/2021/06/08/create-a-balance-reminder-with-vonage-account-api-and-google-apps/"&gt;Vonage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading 💜&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Build a SaaS Application and Fix Vulnerabilities Using MobSF</title>
      <author>Farhan Hasin Chowdhury</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 04:30:47 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/fhsinchy/build-a-saas-application-and-fix-vulnerabilities-using-mobsf-223j</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/fhsinchy/build-a-saas-application-and-fix-vulnerabilities-using-mobsf-223j</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The post-pandemic world has seen an exponential rise in mobile security threats, especially with the exploitation of SaaS vulnerabilities through &lt;a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2021/12/07/cve-2021-44515/"&gt;zero-day attacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 2007, Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone in front of the world with three sentences. They were "Widescreen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone, a breakthrough internet communication device" and for a long time, that's what smartphones were. A fancy device that used to serve as a mobile phone, a music player, a handheld gaming device, and an internet browser. Even the cameras were quite bad back then. So, getting hacked wasn't a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, 2021 presents a different picture. Mobile phones have become one of the most important devices that we carry around. And so does their protection from rising cyber attacks. In case of a security breach, you can lose a lot of stuff and the saddest part is that breaches are not that uncommon anymore. As per &lt;a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/2021/04/12/check-points-mobile-security-report-2021-almost-every-organization-experienced-a-mobile-related-attack-in-2020/"&gt;Checkpoint&lt;/a&gt;, 46% of organizations in the US suffer from mobile security threats in 2020. Moreover, four out of ten global smartphone users are vulnerable to some or other kind of security threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read the entire write-up on &lt;a href="https://aviyel.com/post/1489/build-a-saas-application-and-fix-vulnerabilities-using-mobsf"&gt;Aviyel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Typing Effect with JS</title>
      <author>Jatin Sharma</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 04:26:24 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/j471n/typing-effect-with-js-34b8</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/j471n/typing-effect-with-js-34b8</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As you may have already seen some website which has some kind of typing animation. It looks cool right but what if I tell you it is very easy to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have already made an article about how you can make this type of effect with CSS but today we will build something different than that. In this effect, you can give multiple strings and it will display one by one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, let's visualize what I am talking about - &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#preview"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Preview
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6q6iGbVl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/0vwGdE4.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6q6iGbVl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/0vwGdE4.gif" alt="preview" width="582" height="99"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make this work we need to use a library called &lt;a href="https://mattboldt.github.io/typed.js/"&gt;typed.js&lt;/a&gt; So firstly add the following script to your project.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/typed.js@2.0.12"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now let's look at the rest of code, how this is cooking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#html"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  HTML
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Hi, I am &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"title"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;HTML is very simple we just need to use only one element in order to make this work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#js"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  JS
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;strings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Jatin Sharma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;React Developer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Python Developer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;typeSpeed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;40&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;backSpeed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;40&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;loop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;typed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Typed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/j471n/embed/qBPdXdm?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://codepen.io/j471n/pen/qBPdXdm"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8AKOF1Df--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://imgur.com/MNtTdVp.png" alt="codepen" width="300" height="76"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
