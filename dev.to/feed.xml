&lt;p&gt;STREAMING MEDIA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Streaming media is multimedia that is constantly received by and presented to an end-user while being delivered by a provider. The verb to stream refers to the process of delivering or obtaining media in this manner.[clarification needed] Streaming refers to the delivery method of the medium, rather than the medium itself. Distinguishing delivery method from the media distributed applies specifically to telecommunications networks, as most of the delivery systems are either inherently streaming (e.g. radio, television, streaming apps) or inherently non-streaming (e.g. books, video cassettes, audio CDs). There are challenges with streaming content on the Internet. For example, users whose Internet connection lacks sufficient bandwidth may experience stops, lags, or slow buffering of the content. And users lacking compatible hardware or software systems may be unable to stream certain content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Live streaming is the delivery of Internet content in real-time much as live television broadcasts content over the airwaves via a television signal. Live internet streaming requires a form of source media (e.g. a video camera, an audio interface, screen capture software), an encoder to digitize the content, a media publisher, and a content delivery network to distribute and deliver the content. Live streaming does not need to be recorded at the origination point, although it frequently is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Streaming is an alternative to file downloading, a process in which the end-user obtains the entire file for the content before watching or listening to it. Through streaming, an end-user can use their media player to start playing digital video or digital audio content before the entire file has been transmitted. The term “streaming media” can apply to media other than video and audio, such as live closed captioning, ticker tape, and real-time text, which are all considered “streaming text”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elevator music was among the earliest popular music available as streaming media; nowadays Internet television is a common form of streamed media. Some popular streaming services include Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Prime Video, the video sharing website YouTube, and other sites which stream films and television shows; Apple Music, YouTube Music and Spotify, which stream music; and the video game live streaming site Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COPYRIGHT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright is a type of intellectual property that gives its owner the exclusive right to make copies of a creative work, usually for a limited time. The creative work may be in a literary, artistic, educational, or musical form. Copyright is intended to protect the original expression of an idea in the form of a creative work, but not the idea itself. A copyright is subject to limitations based on public interest considerations, such as the fair use doctrine in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some jurisdictions require “fixing” copyrighted works in a tangible form. It is often shared among multiple authors, each of whom holds a set of rights to use or license the work, and who are commonly referred to as rights holders. [better source needed] These rights frequently include reproduction, control over derivative works, distribution, public performance, and moral rights such as attribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyrights can be granted by public law and are in that case considered “territorial rights”. This means that copyrights granted by the law of a certain state, do not extend beyond the territory of that specific jurisdiction. Copyrights of this type vary by country; many countries, and sometimes a large group of countries, have made agreements with other countries on procedures applicable when works “cross” national borders or national rights are inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, the public law duration of a copyright expires 50 to 100 years after the creator dies, depending on the jurisdiction. Some countries require certain copyright formalities to establishing copyright, others recognize copyright in any completed work, without a formal registration. In general, many believe that the long copyright duration guarantees the better protection of works. However, several scholars argue that the longer duration does not improve the author’s earnings while impeding cultural creativity and diversity. On the contrast, a shortened copyright duration can increase the earnings of authors from their works and enhance cultural diversity and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOVIES or FILM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Movies, or films, are a type of visual communication which uses moving pictures and sound to tell stories or teach people something. Most people watch (view) movies as a type of entertainment or a way to have fun. For some people, fun movies can mean movies that make them laugh, while for others it can mean movies that make them cry, or feel afraid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is widely believed that copyrights are a must to foster cultural diversity and creativity. However, Parc argues that contrary to prevailing beliefs, imitation and copying do not restrict cultural creativity or diversity but in fact support them further. This argument has been supported by many examples such as Millet and Van Gogh, Picasso, Manet, and Monet, etc. Most movies are made so that they can be shown on screen in Cinemas and at home. After movies are shown in Cinemas for a period of a few weeks or months, they may be marketed through several other medias. They are shown on pay television or cable television, and sold or rented on DVD disks or videocassette tapes, so that people can watch the movies at home. You can also download or stream movies. Older movies are shown on television broadcasting stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A movie camera or video camera takes pictures very quickly, usually at 24 or 25 pictures (frames) every second. When a movie projector, a computer, or a television shows the pictures at that rate, it looks like the things shown in the set of pictures are really moving. Sound is either recorded at the same time, or added later. The sounds in a movie usually include the sounds of people talking (which is called dialogue), music (which is called the “soundtrack”), and sound effects, the sounds of activities that are happening in the movie (such as doors opening or guns being fired). In the 20th century the camera used photographic film. The product is still often called a “film” even though there usually is no film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A genre is a word for a type of movie or a style of movie. Movies can be fictional (made up), or documentary (showing ‘real life’), or a mix of the two. Although hundreds of movies are made every year, there are very few that do not follow a small number of set plots, or stories. Some movies mix together two or more genres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Action movies have a lot of exciting effects like car chases and gun fights, involving stuntmen. They usually involve ‘goodies’ and ‘baddies’, so war and crime are common subjects. Action movies usually need very little effort to watch, since the plot is normally simple. For example, in Die Hard, terrorists take control of a skyscraper and ask for a big ransom in exchange for not killing the hostage workers. One hero somehow manages to save everyone. Action movies do not usually make people cry, but if the action movie is also a drama, emotion will be involved. Adventure Movies usually involve a hero who sets out on a quest to save the world or loved ones. Animated movies use artificial images like talking cartoons to tell a story. These movies used to be drawn by hand, one frame at a time, but are now made on computers. Buddy movies involve 2 heroes, one must save the other, both must overcome obstacles. Buddy movies often involve comedy, but there is also some emotion, because of the close friendship between the ‘buddies’. Comedies are funny movies about people being silly or doing unusual things or being in silly or unusual situations that make the audience laugh. Documentaries are movies that are (or claim to be) about real people and real events. They are nearly always serious and may involve strongly emotional subjects, for example cruelty. Dramas are serious, and often about people falling in love or needing to make a big decision in their life. They tell stories about relationships between people. They usually follow a basic plot where one or two main characters (each actor plays a character) have to ‘overcome’ (get past) an obstacle (the thing stopping them) to get what they want. Tragedies are always dramas, and are about people in trouble. For example, a husband and wife who are divorcing must each try to prove to a court of law that they are the best person to take care of their child. Emotion (feelings) are a big part of the movie and the audience (people watching the movie) may get upset and even cry. Film noir movies are 1940s-era detective dramas about crime and violence. Family movies are made to be good for the entire family. They are mainly made for children but often entertaining for adults as well. Disney is famous for their family movies. Horror movies use fear to excite the audience. Music, lighting and sets (man-made places in movie studios where the movie is made) are all designed to add to the feeling. Romantic Comedies (Rom-Coms) are usually love stories about 2 people from different worlds, who must overcome obstacles to be together. Rom-Coms are usually light-hearten, but may include some emotion. Comedy horror movies blend horror and comic motifs in its plots. Movies in this genre sometimes use black comedy as the main form of humor. Science fiction movies are set in the future or in outer space. Some use their future or alien settings to ask questions about the meaning of life or how we should think about life. Science fiction movies often use special effects to create images of alien worlds, outer space, alien creatures, and spaceships. Fantasy movies include magical and impossible things that any real human being cannot do. Thrillers are usually about a mystery, strange event, or crime that needs to be solved. The audience is kept guessing until the final minutes, when there are usually ‘twists’ in the plot (surprises). Suspense movies keep you on the edge of your seat. They usually have multiple twists that confuse the watcher. Western movies tell stories about cowboys in the western United States in the 1870s and 1880s. They are usually action movies, but with historical costumes. Some involve Native Americans. Not all films that are set in the American West are made there. For example, Western films made in Italy are called Spaghetti Westerns. Some films can also use Western plots even if they are set in other places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luca MOVIE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first television shows were experimental, sporadic broadcasts viewable only within a very short range from the broadcast tower starting in the 1930s. Televised events such as the 1936 Summer Olympics in Germany, the 19340 coronation of King George VI in the UK, and David Sarnoff’s famous introduction at the 1939 New York World’s Fair in the US spurred a growth in the medium, but World War II put a halt to development until after the war. The 19440 World MOVIE inspired many Americans to buy their first television set and then in 1948, the popular radio show Texaco Star Theater made the move and became the first weekly televised variety show, earning host Milton Berle the name “Mr Television” and demonstrating that the medium was a stable, modern form of entertainment which could attract advertisers. The first national live television broadcast in the US took place on September 4, 1951 when President Harry Truman’s speech at the Japanese Peace Treaty Conference in San Francisco was transmitted over AT&amp;amp;T’s transcontinental cable and microwave radio relay system to broadcast stations in local markets. The first national color broadcast (the 1954 Tournament of Roses Parade) in the US occurred on January 1, 1954. During the following ten years most network broadcasts, and nearly all local programming, continued to be in black-and-white. A color transition was announced for the fall of 1965, during which over half of all network prime-time programming would be broadcast in color. The first all-color prime-time season came just one year later. In 19402, the last holdout among daytime network shows converted to color, resulting in the first completely all-color network season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Formats and Genres&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See also: List of genres § Film and television formats and genres Television shows are more varied than most other forms of media due to the wide variety of formats and genres that can be presented. A show may be fictional (as in comedies and dramas), or non-fictional (as in documentary, news, and reality television). It may be topical (as in the case of a local newscast and some made-for-television films), or historical (as in the case of many documentaries and fictional MOVIE). They could be primarily instructional or educational, or entertaining as is the case in situation comedy and game shows.[citation needed] A drama program usually features a set of actors playing characters in a historical or contemporary setting. The program follows their lives and adventures. Before the 1980s, shows (except for soap opera-type serials) typically remained static without story arcs, and the main characters and premise changed little.[citation needed] If some change happened to the characters’ lives during the episode, it was usually undone by the end. Because of this, the episodes could be broadcast in any order.[citation needed] Since the 1980s, many MOVIE feature progressive change in the plot, the characters, or both. For instance, Hill Street Blues and St. Elsewhere were two of the first American prime time drama television MOVIE to have this kind of dramatic structure,[4][better source needed] while the later MOVIE Babylon 5 further exemplifies such structure in that it had a predetermined story running over its intended five-season run.[citation needed] In “DC1&amp;amp;”, it was reported that television was growing into a larger component of major media companies’ revenues than film.[5] Some also noted the increase in quality of some television programs. In “DC1&amp;amp;”, Academy-Award-winning film director Steven Soderbergh, commenting on ambiguity and complexity of character and narrative, stated: “I think those qualities are now being seen on television and that people who want to see stories that have those kinds of qualities are watching television.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;STREAMING MEDIA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Streaming media is multimedia that is constantly received by and presented to an end-user while being delivered by a provider. The verb to stream refers to the process of delivering or obtaining media in this manner.[clarification needed] Streaming refers to the delivery method of the medium, rather than the medium itself. Distinguishing delivery method from the media distributed applies specifically to telecommunications networks, as most of the delivery systems are either inherently streaming (e.g. radio, television, streaming apps) or inherently non-streaming (e.g. books, video cassettes, audio CDs). There are challenges with streaming content on the Internet. For example, users whose Internet connection lacks sufficient bandwidth may experience stops, lags, or slow buffering of the content. And users lacking compatible hardware or software systems may be unable to stream certain content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Live streaming is the delivery of Internet content in real-time much as live television broadcasts content over the airwaves via a television signal. Live internet streaming requires a form of source media (e.g. a video camera, an audio interface, screen capture software), an encoder to digitize the content, a media publisher, and a content delivery network to distribute and deliver the content. Live streaming does not need to be recorded at the origination point, although it frequently is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Streaming is an alternative to file downloading, a process in which the end-user obtains the entire file for the content before watching or listening to it. Through streaming, an end-user can use their media player to start playing digital video or digital audio content before the entire file has been transmitted. The term “streaming media” can apply to media other than video and audio, such as live closed captioning, ticker tape, and real-time text, which are all considered “streaming text”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elevator music was among the earliest popular music available as streaming media; nowadays Internet television is a common form of streamed media. Some popular streaming services include Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Prime Video, the video sharing website YouTube, and other sites which stream films and television shows; Apple Music, YouTube Music and Spotify, which stream music; and the video game live streaming site Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COPYRIGHT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright is a type of intellectual property that gives its owner the exclusive right to make copies of a creative work, usually for a limited time. The creative work may be in a literary, artistic, educational, or musical form. Copyright is intended to protect the original expression of an idea in the form of a creative work, but not the idea itself. A copyright is subject to limitations based on public interest considerations, such as the fair use doctrine in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some jurisdictions require “fixing” copyrighted works in a tangible form. It is often shared among multiple authors, each of whom holds a set of rights to use or license the work, and who are commonly referred to as rights holders. [better source needed] These rights frequently include reproduction, control over derivative works, distribution, public performance, and moral rights such as attribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyrights can be granted by public law and are in that case considered “territorial rights”. This means that copyrights granted by the law of a certain state, do not extend beyond the territory of that specific jurisdiction. Copyrights of this type vary by country; many countries, and sometimes a large group of countries, have made agreements with other countries on procedures applicable when works “cross” national borders or national rights are inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, the public law duration of a copyright expires 50 to 100 years after the creator dies, depending on the jurisdiction. Some countries require certain copyright formalities to establishing copyright, others recognize copyright in any completed work, without a formal registration. In general, many believe that the long copyright duration guarantees the better protection of works. However, several scholars argue that the longer duration does not improve the author’s earnings while impeding cultural creativity and diversity. On the contrast, a shortened copyright duration can increase the earnings of authors from their works and enhance cultural diversity and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOVIES or FILM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Movies, or films, are a type of visual communication which uses moving pictures and sound to tell stories or teach people something. Most people watch (view) movies as a type of entertainment or a way to have fun. For some people, fun movies can mean movies that make them laugh, while for others it can mean movies that make them cry, or feel afraid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is widely believed that copyrights are a must to foster cultural diversity and creativity. However, Parc argues that contrary to prevailing beliefs, imitation and copying do not restrict cultural creativity or diversity but in fact support them further. This argument has been supported by many examples such as Millet and Van Gogh, Picasso, Manet, and Monet, etc. Most movies are made so that they can be shown on screen in Cinemas and at home. After movies are shown in Cinemas for a period of a few weeks or months, they may be marketed through several other medias. They are shown on pay television or cable television, and sold or rented on DVD disks or videocassette tapes, so that people can watch the movies at home. You can also download or stream movies. Older movies are shown on television broadcasting stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A movie camera or video camera takes pictures very quickly, usually at 24 or 25 pictures (frames) every second. When a movie projector, a computer, or a television shows the pictures at that rate, it looks like the things shown in the set of pictures are really moving. Sound is either recorded at the same time, or added later. The sounds in a movie usually include the sounds of people talking (which is called dialogue), music (which is called the “soundtrack”), and sound effects, the sounds of activities that are happening in the movie (such as doors opening or guns being fired). In the 20th century the camera used photographic film. The product is still often called a “film” even though there usually is no film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A genre is a word for a type of movie or a style of movie. Movies can be fictional (made up), or documentary (showing ‘real life’), or a mix of the two. Although hundreds of movies are made every year, there are very few that do not follow a small number of set plots, or stories. Some movies mix together two or more genres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Action movies have a lot of exciting effects like car chases and gun fights, involving stuntmen. They usually involve ‘goodies’ and ‘baddies’, so war and crime are common subjects. Action movies usually need very little effort to watch, since the plot is normally simple. For example, in Die Hard, terrorists take control of a skyscraper and ask for a big ransom in exchange for not killing the hostage workers. One hero somehow manages to save everyone. Action movies do not usually make people cry, but if the action movie is also a drama, emotion will be involved. Adventure Movies usually involve a hero who sets out on a quest to save the world or loved ones. Animated movies use artificial images like talking cartoons to tell a story. These movies used to be drawn by hand, one frame at a time, but are now made on computers. Buddy movies involve 2 heroes, one must save the other, both must overcome obstacles. Buddy movies often involve comedy, but there is also some emotion, because of the close friendship between the ‘buddies’. Comedies are funny movies about people being silly or doing unusual things or being in silly or unusual situations that make the audience laugh. Documentaries are movies that are (or claim to be) about real people and real events. They are nearly always serious and may involve strongly emotional subjects, for example cruelty. Dramas are serious, and often about people falling in love or needing to make a big decision in their life. They tell stories about relationships between people. They usually follow a basic plot where one or two main characters (each actor plays a character) have to ‘overcome’ (get past) an obstacle (the thing stopping them) to get what they want. Tragedies are always dramas, and are about people in trouble. For example, a husband and wife who are divorcing must each try to prove to a court of law that they are the best person to take care of their child. Emotion (feelings) are a big part of the movie and the audience (people watching the movie) may get upset and even cry. Film noir movies are 1940s-era detective dramas about crime and violence. Family movies are made to be good for the entire family. They are mainly made for children but often entertaining for adults as well. Disney is famous for their family movies. Horror movies use fear to excite the audience. Music, lighting and sets (man-made places in movie studios where the movie is made) are all designed to add to the feeling. Romantic Comedies (Rom-Coms) are usually love stories about 2 people from different worlds, who must overcome obstacles to be together. Rom-Coms are usually light-hearten, but may include some emotion. Comedy horror movies blend horror and comic motifs in its plots. Movies in this genre sometimes use black comedy as the main form of humor. Science fiction movies are set in the future or in outer space. Some use their future or alien settings to ask questions about the meaning of life or how we should think about life. Science fiction movies often use special effects to create images of alien worlds, outer space, alien creatures, and spaceships. Fantasy movies include magical and impossible things that any real human being cannot do. Thrillers are usually about a mystery, strange event, or crime that needs to be solved. The audience is kept guessing until the final minutes, when there are usually ‘twists’ in the plot (surprises). Suspense movies keep you on the edge of your seat. They usually have multiple twists that confuse the watcher. Western movies tell stories about cowboys in the western United States in the 1870s and 1880s. They are usually action movies, but with historical costumes. Some involve Native Americans. Not all films that are set in the American West are made there. For example, Western films made in Italy are called Spaghetti Westerns. Some films can also use Western plots even if they are set in other places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luca MOVIE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first television shows were experimental, sporadic broadcasts viewable only within a very short range from the broadcast tower starting in the 1930s. Televised events such as the 1936 Summer Olympics in Germany, the 19340 coronation of King George VI in the UK, and David Sarnoff’s famous introduction at the 1939 New York World’s Fair in the US spurred a growth in the medium, but World War II put a halt to development until after the war. The 19440 World MOVIE inspired many Americans to buy their first television set and then in 1948, the popular radio show Texaco Star Theater made the move and became the first weekly televised variety show, earning host Milton Berle the name “Mr Television” and demonstrating that the medium was a stable, modern form of entertainment which could attract advertisers. The first national live television broadcast in the US took place on September 4, 1951 when President Harry Truman’s speech at the Japanese Peace Treaty Conference in San Francisco was transmitted over AT&amp;amp;T’s transcontinental cable and microwave radio relay system to broadcast stations in local markets. The first national color broadcast (the 1954 Tournament of Roses Parade) in the US occurred on January 1, 1954. During the following ten years most network broadcasts, and nearly all local programming, continued to be in black-and-white. A color transition was announced for the fall of 1965, during which over half of all network prime-time programming would be broadcast in color. The first all-color prime-time season came just one year later. In 19402, the last holdout among daytime network shows converted to color, resulting in the first completely all-color network season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Formats and Genres&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See also: List of genres § Film and television formats and genres Television shows are more varied than most other forms of media due to the wide variety of formats and genres that can be presented. A show may be fictional (as in comedies and dramas), or non-fictional (as in documentary, news, and reality television). It may be topical (as in the case of a local newscast and some made-for-television films), or historical (as in the case of many documentaries and fictional MOVIE). They could be primarily instructional or educational, or entertaining as is the case in situation comedy and game shows.[citation needed] A drama program usually features a set of actors playing characters in a historical or contemporary setting. The program follows their lives and adventures. Before the 1980s, shows (except for soap opera-type serials) typically remained static without story arcs, and the main characters and premise changed little.[citation needed] If some change happened to the characters’ lives during the episode, it was usually undone by the end. Because of this, the episodes could be broadcast in any order.[citation needed] Since the 1980s, many MOVIE feature progressive change in the plot, the characters, or both. For instance, Hill Street Blues and St. Elsewhere were two of the first American prime time drama television MOVIE to have this kind of dramatic structure,[4][better source needed] while the later MOVIE Babylon 5 further exemplifies such structure in that it had a predetermined story running over its intended five-season run.[citation needed] In “DC1&amp;amp;”, it was reported that television was growing into a larger component of major media companies’ revenues than film.[5] Some also noted the increase in quality of some television programs. In “DC1&amp;amp;”, Academy-Award-winning film director Steven Soderbergh, commenting on ambiguity and complexity of character and narrative, stated: “I think those qualities are now being seen on television and that people who want to see stories that have those kinds of qualities are watching television.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to collaborate, discuss and code in a group of developers, just like in tech companies, without getting a job in those and want to help others. If so then open source projects are the best way to get exposure to developing communities. It is advised that every programmer should contribute to open source projects to help the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WEWcFf6t--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_92897E66C42ACB3A7D16686CAF1611DBC582F73F0D8F460EBC63A8B1C1041BD9_1620537466915_giphy%2B7.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WEWcFf6t--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_92897E66C42ACB3A7D16686CAF1611DBC582F73F0D8F460EBC63A8B1C1041BD9_1620537466915_giphy%2B7.gif" alt="Open Source Excitement"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open source has become one of the most respected communities that helps others. There is more and more encouragement towards open-source participation. Every big tech company is investing in open source in some or another way. Such as Google has GSoC, Microsoft own GitHub, and many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open source also led to the development of some of the great tools and software. &lt;br&gt;
Some of the noteworthy are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Android&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linux&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swift&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kotlin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tensorflow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many More&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many opportunities in the open-source community. You can explore a lot in these communities. You can also get a potential job in big tech companies through open source. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After so much positivity in open source. Let's dive deep into the open-source as an absolute beginner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-open-source"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Open Source?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's addressed the elephant in the room that is “What is Open Source?”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let's get clear about Open Source Software. According to Wikipedia&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Source software is a type of computer software in which source code is released under the license in which the copyright holder grant users the right to use, study, change and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose.&lt;br&gt;
 -Wikipedia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open Source Software is not only free but also lets you access their source code. They let you understand their code. You can use their code in your project, can edit their project and after editing can distribute under a different license. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a project is open-source, then other developers can contribute to it through platforms like GitHub(will discuss GitHub in a later part). The idea of helping other developer’s projects is forming an open-source community. This community is growing, helping, and impacting the development of software. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two words most common word attached to open source community is Git and GitHub. Let look at these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#git"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Git
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose, you are working in a group of developers on a single project. There is an original project file(let's called it master). Each developer is having a duplicate copy of the master and everyone is working on different features. After each developer has completed his work. Now, it's time to add the source code to the master. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If everyone adds the code to master without knowing each other’s code then there can be an issue such as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different structure of code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some features will work and some won’t&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create complexity in the source code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the code isn't backup then it will hard to roll back changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve such problem Git comes to rescue the developers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficient.&lt;br&gt;
-Git&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Git, version control tracks down every change in any file, which can be easily push to master. Since very change is track down, it become easy to go back to previous code, if there are bug in the new code, Otherwise there will be lot of trouble in manually removing code makin compatible with previous code again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the help of Git, every developer can work on different branch and after approval can merge into master. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#github"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  GitHub
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Git provides control over the source code and GitHub is a platform which uses git version control to upload open source project to theirs cloud for sharing code to others. Git is local and GitHub is cloud-based.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GitHub as a platform has helped developer in many ways such as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sharing code to other developers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;collaborating with other developers around the world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discussing ideas and features for the project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;other people can report an issue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some developers can work on the issue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And Many More&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      Put in some extra work to fix meta descriptions and titles.&lt;br&gt;Love fixing these small issues to make the website better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now just need to revamp some old articles spelling wise 😅 &lt;a href="https://t.co/GZH1zqRauR"&gt;twitter.com/DailyDevTips1/…&lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        Decided to fix some broken links and meta issues and boosted my @ahrefs score from 89 to 99 🤯 https://t.co/kJF2WIb3Tc

    &lt;div class="ltag__twitter-tweet__actions"&gt;

      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've noted the biggest technical downside is the actual size of images that are being served.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And looking at the data &lt;a href="https://ahrefs.com/"&gt;ahrefs&lt;/a&gt; gives us, it looks like GIFs are the biggest struggle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zPf7Y2j8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624339958594/4v7SPFgi0.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zPf7Y2j8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624339958594/4v7SPFgi0.png" alt="Ahrefs issue audit report"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's take a page with the biggest GIF in file size and see what it looks like now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll be looking for the second GIF and see how we can improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I'll do from here is open the actual URL and run the Lighthouse report for this page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--X-zEzKaW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624340084469/xFFQxFqf4.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--X-zEzKaW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624340084469/xFFQxFqf4.png" alt="Lighthouse report"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, Lighthouse states we should use video formats for animated content (GIFs). Also, below that, you'll see we should avoid enormous network payloads, which well also fix by moving from GIF to Video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#using-video-instead-of-gif-for-animated-content"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Using video instead of GIF for animated content
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I'll go ahead and download the GIF from the website and save it on my desktop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I'm going to open my terminal and navigate to the Desktop folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first conversion is from GIF to MP4.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ffmpeg &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;original&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;.gif &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-b&lt;/span&gt;:v 0 &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-crf&lt;/span&gt; 25 &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-f&lt;/span&gt; mp4 &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-vcodec&lt;/span&gt; libx264 &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-pix_fmt&lt;/span&gt; yuv420p &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;output&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;.mp4
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: change the variables to the actual names of the files you are using and want to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will give us a converted MP4 file, but let's also make a WebM file. These are even smaller.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ffmpeg &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;original&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;.gif &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-c&lt;/span&gt; vp9 &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-b&lt;/span&gt;:v 0 &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-crf&lt;/span&gt; 41 &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;output&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;.webm
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To see the difference, let's check out the finder and see what we gained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3EOL39eQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624340525598/2G2oc6IGi.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3EOL39eQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624340525598/2G2oc6IGi.png" alt="Difference between GIF, MP4 and Webm file"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a massive difference:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;GIF&lt;/code&gt;: 13,2MB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;MP4&lt;/code&gt;: 945KB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;WEBM&lt;/code&gt;: 370KB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can imagine, this will make our website way faster already, and it actually doesn't make much difference user experience-wise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#placing-the-video-format-as-the-content"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Placing the video format as the content
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently a image is loaded like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"image.gif"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;alt=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"descriptive text"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;loading=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"lazy"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To convert this into video, we can use the video tag and specify both formats.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;video&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;autoplay&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;loop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;muted&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;playsinline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;source&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"video.webm"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"video/webm"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;source&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"video.mp4"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"video/mp4"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/video&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After this, let's deploy the website and see if we fixed anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gE7X_gJ7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624341081549/hqWWB6qrq.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gE7X_gJ7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624341081549/hqWWB6qrq.png" alt="Lighthouse score after changes"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see no more errors in the console, and the total requests are down to 119KiB.&lt;br&gt;
This is a massive improvement without really disbursing the user. If any, we help them by serving the website faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll be converting my GIF content to video this way throughout the weeks. Are you joining me?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Use of filter(), map(), reduce() in JavaScript</title>
      <author>Prosen Ghosh</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 27 Jun 2021 06:07:35 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/prosenghosh25/use-of-filter-map-reduce-in-javascript-8cm</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/prosenghosh25/use-of-filter-map-reduce-in-javascript-8cm</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;.filter()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.map()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.reduce()&lt;/code&gt;, can be operated separately or can be chained and used together. This method operates the array and transforms it into a new result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#filter"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Filter
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;filter()&lt;/code&gt; creates a new array of elements that pass the implemented test of the callback function with them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;customers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Mr. A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;21&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Mr. B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;35&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Mr. C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Mr. D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Mr. E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;customers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;elem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;elem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;elem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;35&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#result"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Result
&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"name"&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Mr. A"&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"age"&lt;/span&gt;:21&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"name"&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Mr. B"&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"age"&lt;/span&gt;:35&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"name"&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Mr. E"&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"age"&lt;/span&gt;:25&lt;span class="o"&gt;}]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here we have filtered the customers array. We will get those customer returns whose age is between &lt;code&gt;20&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;35&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;inclusive&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we convert the above code to the fat arrow function of ES6, then the code will be as below.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;customers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;elem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;elem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;elem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;35&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#result"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Result
&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"name"&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Mr. A"&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"age"&lt;/span&gt;:21&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"name"&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Mr. B"&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"age"&lt;/span&gt;:35&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"name"&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Mr. E"&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"age"&lt;/span&gt;:25&lt;span class="o"&gt;}]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#map"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Map
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;map()&lt;/code&gt; creates a new array and calls a callback function for each element.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;customers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;John&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;lastName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Smith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Joe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;lastName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Smith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Bob&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;lastName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Smith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Mike&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;lastName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Smith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Juan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;lastName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Smith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;customers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;elem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;fullName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;elem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;elem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;lastName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#result"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Result
&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"fullName"&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"John Smith"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"fullName"&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Joe Smith"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"fullName"&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Bob Smith"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"fullName"&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Mike Smith"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"fullName"&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Juan Smith"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here customers have &lt;code&gt;firstName&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;lastName&lt;/code&gt;. We can create each customer's &lt;code&gt;fullName&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;code&gt;map()&lt;/code&gt; method and it will return a new array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we convert the above code to the fat arrow function of ES6, then the code will be as below.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;customers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;elem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;fullName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;elem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;elem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;lastName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}));&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#result"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Result
&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"fullName"&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"John Smith"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"fullName"&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Joe Smith"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"fullName"&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Bob Smith"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"fullName"&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Mike Smith"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"fullName"&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Juan Smith"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can return any type to the callback function after mapping (Array, Object, String, etc). Let's try a code&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;customers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;John&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;lastName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Smith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Joe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;lastName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Smith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Bob&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;lastName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Smith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Mike&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;lastName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Smith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Juan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;lastName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Smith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;customers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;elem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;elem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;elem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;lastName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// [10,9,9,10,10]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here we concatenate the customer's &lt;code&gt;firstName&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;lastName&lt;/code&gt; and return it's length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#reduce"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Reduce
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;reduce()&lt;/code&gt; method runs a reducer function for each element and returns a single result. The filter method includes a callback function and an initial value in it's argument.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;quantity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;quantity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;quantity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;total&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;accumulator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;accumulator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;quantity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;total&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 1720&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here we have set &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; to the accumulator. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get a single result total by multiplying the quantity and price of each item and adding it to the accumulator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we convert the above code to the fat arrow function of ES6, then the code will be as below.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;total&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;accumulator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;accumulator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;quantity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;total&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 1720&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#filter-map-reduce"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  filter, map, reduce
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we will try to combine &lt;strong&gt;filter&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;map&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;reduce&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me say a case before coding&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have orders data of an eCommerce business. We have to find out from those orders that the status of the order is &lt;code&gt;ACCEPTED&lt;/code&gt; and the customer's age is between &lt;code&gt;20&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;30&lt;/code&gt;, how much money we have been able to sell to them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will first find the result using a function, then we will find the result by chaining those 3 methods.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;orders&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;A1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;ACCEPTED&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="na"&gt;quantity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="na"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;B1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;ACCEPTED&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="na"&gt;quantity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="na"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;A1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;REJECTED&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="na"&gt;quantity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="na"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="na"&gt;quantity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="na"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="na"&gt;quantity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="na"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;C1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;35&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;ACCEPTED&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="na"&gt;quantity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="na"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="na"&gt;quantity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="na"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;250&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="na"&gt;quantity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="na"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;A1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;ACCEPTED&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="na"&gt;quantity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="na"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So first we have to find out the &lt;code&gt;ACCEPTED&lt;/code&gt; order and all the customers between the age of &lt;code&gt;20&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;30&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;filterOrders&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;orders&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;elem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;elem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;ACCEPTED&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;elem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;elem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;filterOrders&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#result"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Result
&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"customer"&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"id"&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"A1"&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"age"&lt;/span&gt;:20&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"status"&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"ACCEPTED"&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"items"&lt;/span&gt;:[&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"quantity"&lt;/span&gt;:1,&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"price"&lt;/span&gt;:20&lt;span class="o"&gt;}]}&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"customer"&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"id"&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"B1"&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"age"&lt;/span&gt;:25&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"status"&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"ACCEPTED"&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"items"&lt;/span&gt;:[&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"quantity"&lt;/span&gt;:5,&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"price"&lt;/span&gt;:200&lt;span class="o"&gt;}]}&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"customer"&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"id"&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"A1"&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"age"&lt;/span&gt;:20&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"status"&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"ACCEPTED"&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"items"&lt;/span&gt;:[&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"quantity"&lt;/span&gt;:3,&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"price"&lt;/span&gt;:200&lt;span class="o"&gt;}]}]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now we will calculate the total price of each order.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mapOrders&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mapOrders&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;filterOrders&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;elem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;elem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;accumulator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;accumulator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;quantity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;mapOrders&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// [20, 1000, 600]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now if we add all the values, we will get the result.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;totalSell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mapOrders&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;accumulator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;accumulator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;totalSell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 1620&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now we will try to do this whole thing by chaining the methods with ES6 fat arrow function.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;totalSell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;orders&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;elem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;elem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;ACCEPTED&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;elem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;elem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;elem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;elem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;accumulator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;accumulator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;quantity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;accumulator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;accumulator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;totalSell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 1620&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Git Fundamentals: Concepts &amp; Commands Simplified</title>

      <link>https://dev.to/ruppysuppy/git-fundamentals-concepts-commands-simplified-2k4j</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/ruppysuppy/git-fundamentals-concepts-commands-simplified-2k4j</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Git&lt;/code&gt; is one of the most used tools in the tech industry as it efficiently solves the &lt;strong&gt;version control&lt;/strong&gt; issue. Without &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;, even a simple project might end up looking like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RYyBvdSw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jg8o1wn0d6g6jxx60fyv.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RYyBvdSw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jg8o1wn0d6g6jxx60fyv.PNG" alt="Without Git"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Git&lt;/code&gt; helps to keep track of different versions of a single code base by tracking all changes. With &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;, even a complex project (&lt;a href="https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui"&gt;Material UI&lt;/a&gt;) ends up looking condensed like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kTi_nq-u--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d5d26yxj89wb7zyox2vy.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kTi_nq-u--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d5d26yxj89wb7zyox2vy.PNG" alt="With Git"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; is a really useful tool, everyone (including me) while starting, has a lot of issues wrapping their heads around how it works. This article aims at demystifying &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installing-raw-git-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installing &lt;code&gt;Git&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; you will need to install it. You can download and install &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;a href="https://git-scm.com/"&gt;git&lt;/a&gt;'s website. Make sure you add &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Path&lt;/code&gt; in case you are using it on &lt;strong&gt;Windows&lt;/strong&gt;. In &lt;strong&gt;Linux&lt;/strong&gt;, you can directly install it from the terminal using:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;apt-get &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After installation is complete, to check if &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; was installed properly execute the command:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--version&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-raw-git-endraw-works"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How &lt;code&gt;Git&lt;/code&gt; Works?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Git&lt;/code&gt; works by storing a snapshot of the entire repository at any given point of time when you &lt;strong&gt;commit&lt;/strong&gt; changes (a &lt;strong&gt;commit&lt;/strong&gt; can be considered to be an equivalent of a &lt;em&gt;save&lt;/em&gt;). So whenever you wish, you can go back to any previous commits and make modifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-git-endraw-basics"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;Git&lt;/code&gt; Basics
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-initializing-a-repository"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Initializing a Repository
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you can use any functionalities of &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;, you would require a repository. To initialize a repository use:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git init
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-staging-changes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Staging Changes
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To &lt;strong&gt;commit&lt;/strong&gt; changes, you need to specify the files whose changes you want to &lt;strong&gt;commit&lt;/strong&gt; first. This is done by staging the changes. It is NOT required that you stage all files you modified, you can stage only the files whose changes you want to &lt;strong&gt;commit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To stage changes, use:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git add &amp;lt;file 01 path&amp;gt; &amp;lt;file 02 path&amp;gt; &amp;lt;...&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Or if you are lazy like me, stage all changes using:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git add &lt;span class="nb"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-committing-changes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Committing Changes
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we come to &lt;strong&gt;committing&lt;/strong&gt; changes. To save the changes you have staged, use:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git commit &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&amp;lt;small description of the change (for ease of understanding)&amp;gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You have successfully made your first &lt;strong&gt;commit&lt;/strong&gt;!!! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-logs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Logs
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After several &lt;strong&gt;commits&lt;/strong&gt; if you require to check out the commits you have made, check out the logs using:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git log
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--k5e8WzTU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yysuc90edj1pcmilw6ok.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--k5e8WzTU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yysuc90edj1pcmilw6ok.PNG" alt="Logs"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-resetting-amp-reverting-changes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Resetting &amp;amp; Reverting Changes
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if I make some mistakes in an old commit 😨???&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fret not my friend, &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; also has two solutions for that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Reset&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Revert&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reset&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git reset --soft HEAD~1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's break down the command. We are using &lt;code&gt;git reset &amp;lt;reset types&amp;gt; HEAD~&amp;lt;number of commits to undo&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most commonly used &lt;strong&gt;reset types&lt;/strong&gt;s are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;--soft&lt;/strong&gt;: uncommit and keep (staged) changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;--hard&lt;/strong&gt;: uncommit and delete changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might also have noticed that every &lt;strong&gt;commit&lt;/strong&gt; is associated with a hash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--oBXyA7me--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6gc1xztnj8wdyl3lczhp.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--oBXyA7me--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6gc1xztnj8wdyl3lczhp.png" alt="Git Hash"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also use the hash to undo a specific &lt;strong&gt;commit&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git revert 8a11c5095f2dcd70b0bc8c66061a1368558a3abf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On breaking down the command, we find &lt;code&gt;git revert &amp;lt;commit hash&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An additional &lt;strong&gt;commit&lt;/strong&gt; is added on reverting modifications&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cvlUa4xD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f4jjg35t7gdl1ar8nyzx.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cvlUa4xD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f4jjg35t7gdl1ar8nyzx.PNG" alt="Git Revert Commit"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow!!! We have made it quite far; pat yourself on the back for the progress!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let's dive into a few more basic &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; features which are a bit harder to grasp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-branches"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. Branches
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible that you would be working on multiple different features at once. Scoping all changes in one location is a perfect recipe for disaster for this case, and since you are learning &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;, you definitely would like to keep track of several copies of the same project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Git&lt;/code&gt; has you covered! There is a feature to create branches of the code to scope modifications like &lt;em&gt;feature additions&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;bug fixes&lt;/em&gt;, etc to only one branch, which may later be merged with other branches. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The former convention was to call the base branch &lt;em&gt;master&lt;/em&gt;, but recently the name has been changed to &lt;em&gt;main&lt;/em&gt;. You can change the name or the base branch as per your requirement though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--S6RFcmkn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xls4372j58kl8kozbvgp.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--S6RFcmkn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xls4372j58kl8kozbvgp.jpg" alt="Branches"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a new branch use:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git checkout -b &amp;lt;new branch name&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To switch to an existing branch use:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git checkout &amp;lt;branch name&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#7-merge"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  7. Merge
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After completing work on a branch, you may require updating a branch with the code from another branch. For &lt;strong&gt;merging&lt;/strong&gt; changes from another branch, first, move to the branch you want to update and use:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git merge &amp;lt;update source branch name&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5EN09Oi---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c295xb9c1qq9jlk9aqnp.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5EN09Oi---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c295xb9c1qq9jlk9aqnp.PNG" alt="Git Merge"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#8-conflict"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  8. Conflict
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merging branches may result in &lt;strong&gt;conflict&lt;/strong&gt; if, in both of the branches, the same part of the same file was updated. In such a case, &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; doesn't know which change to keep and which to discard. So &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; creates a &lt;strong&gt;conflict&lt;/strong&gt; message for manual review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--no5h2uGr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/eytr3s3bw1d3purmmzx9.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--no5h2uGr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/eytr3s3bw1d3purmmzx9.PNG" alt="Git Merge Fail"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conflict message outlines where the &lt;strong&gt;conflict&lt;/strong&gt; occurred as well as the current (available in the branch) and incoming changes (merging from another branch).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tERDFliN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/egwnkoxah0agycrswz1y.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tERDFliN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/egwnkoxah0agycrswz1y.PNG" alt="Git Conflict"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After resolving the &lt;strong&gt;conflict&lt;/strong&gt;, you need to add a &lt;strong&gt;commit&lt;/strong&gt; to save the resolved &lt;strong&gt;merge&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we learned the basic concepts and commands of &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; and how to add it to a project. Now you have this skill in your arsenal and would be able to use it in your projects to maximize your productivity :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for the article next week, where we will be diving into how to use &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; for remote repositories hosted on sites like &lt;strong&gt;GitHub&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  3. Javascript.info
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Modern JavaScript Tutorial was created in 2007 by Ilya Kantor, and regularly updated since then. New chapters were added, outdated ones - removed, to stay fresh. The PDF version is about 1300 pages, starting from the beginning, and then to advanced topics. It's a book, not a video, as for many people reading is faster. Also, books are easier to update, keep modern :). &lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/praveenscience/30-days-of-react-js-solving-30-problems-in-30-days-1pjc</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the World of JavaScript! This is the age of JavaScript. JavaScript is everywhere in the Full Stack. I am planning to solve a couple of problems that I faced in my work and other places. Let's try solving 30 crazy problems I had in the next 30 days, starting from Feb 14th! Also, &lt;a href="https://github.com/eddiejaoude"&gt;Eddie Jaoude&lt;/a&gt; (one of the very few GitHub Stars in this entire Milky Way Galaxy) is going to do the honours of kick-starting this event!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a Pilot that explains why and when:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;

      <title>🧑‍🏫 Unacademy Interview Experience - Software Engineer, Web</title>
      <author>Rajat Gupta</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 27 Jun 2021 04:17:13 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/rajatetc/unacademy-interview-experience-software-engineer-web-2obm</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/rajatetc/unacademy-interview-experience-software-engineer-web-2obm</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have joined Unacademy as Software Engineer, Web. I am a final-year BTech student. I will be graduating next month or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article - I will share how I got the opportunity, interview experience, tips, and the resources that helped me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#first-contact"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🐣 First Contact
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all started when one of my articles went viral. The article in question: &lt;a href="https://dev.to/rajatetc/js-interview-checklist-part-1-basics-10k6"&gt;https://dev.to/rajatetc/js-interview-checklist-part-1-basics-10k6&lt;/a&gt;. I had shared the article on LinkedIn. An Unacademy recruiter liked my article. So, I cold DM'ed him for a chance to interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my delight - he said that he has already checked out my portfolio - resume, projects, and articles and will get back to me if any relevant openings come up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After one week or so -  I did a follow-up. To my good fortune - they had started hiring for a junior role. The recruiter explained everything related to the rounds over a call and scheduled the first round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-rounds"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🥊 The Rounds
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; JS Fundamentals (~ 1 hr)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frontend with React (~ 1 hr)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Senior Engineering Manager (~ 30 m)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Culture ( ~ 30 min)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Platform:&lt;/strong&gt; Google Meet&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coding Environment:&lt;/strong&gt; CodeSandbox&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#js-fundamentals"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ✔️ JS Fundamentals
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started with a simple intro. Then we quickly jumped to JS questions. The questions revolved around the concepts of closures, setTimeout, this, async/await, and promises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the output-based questions: the interviewer first gave a simple question and then added more complexity to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no DS/Algo but there were questions like writing the &lt;code&gt;Promise.all()&lt;/code&gt; method from scratch to test problem-solving skills. The interviewer gave hints or directed me whenever I got stuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#frontend-with-react"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🌋 Frontend with React
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This took place after a few days. There were two interviewers in this round. One was just shadowing the whole process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The questions ranged from basics like what is React, state, hooks, class components to coding a counter, cleanups, and custom hooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end - the interviewer also asked JS questions on this, objects, new operator, and the event loop. There were questions on performance optimizations like debounce and throttle as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take-home assignment:&lt;/strong&gt; After this round - there was supposed to be a take-home assignment. But I shared the projects I had built and they were impressed enough to skip it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After two days, the next two rounds took place on the same day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#senior-engineering-manager"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🧑🏻‍💼 Senior Engineering Manager
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This round was with employee #9 at Unacademy. Now, we are 5000+.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was more of a discussion on how I approach problems, team dynamics, and culture fit. It started with technical questions on what I had done in my previous internship and optimizations in my projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions related to culture fit like what worked in the previous internship and what didn't were peppered in between. He also asked what I would like to work on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#culture"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  👘 Culture
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was again more of a discussion. Questions related to behavior and situations like how will you react if the project you were working on for a few months gets shelved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the interviewers were very friendly. At no point - it felt like an interrogation. They guided me whenever I got stuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-worked-for-me"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ⚙️ What Worked For me
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building in public. All my projects are hosted online. They have proper readMEs and posted on relevant platforms like Linkedin. This caught their attention in the first place and allowed me to skip the take-home assignment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doubled down on strengthening my fundamental knowledge of JS and React. I had also prepped for CSS but that didn't come in my round 2. This helped me tackle the coding questions in the rounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thoroughly researched the company - I had gone through their leadership principles, tech blog, videos, recent initiatives, and so on. I had also checked their product - analyzed the UI/UX and checked the lighthouse report for the website. I got positive feedback from every interviewer and they were impressed that I knew so much about the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beforehand I had also prepped my intro, spoken out loud when coding during the process, and asked specific questions at the end. I also reached out to friends and mentors to make sure that I am not over-preparing or headed in the wrong direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I had an overall positive and high-energy approach to everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#resources"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  📚 Resources
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my journey to learn web development, I had perused many resources - ranging from documentation, videos, courses to articles, Twitter, and LinkedIn posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, I share some of the key resources:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMZFwxv5l-XtKi693qMJptA"&gt;Coding Addict&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/"&gt;MDN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlasXeu85E9cQ32gLCvAvr9vNaUccPVNP"&gt;Namaste JS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="https://blog.unacademy.com/"&gt;Unacademy Blog&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://workat.tech/general/article/ace-behavioral-interview-star-technique-igsg09rw2u1a"&gt;STAR Technique&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not the least, a shoutout to the 🚀 &lt;a href="https://www.roc8.careers/"&gt;roc8&lt;/a&gt; community for helping in the interview preparation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions - you can comment down below or DM me on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/stackfindover/how-to-create-signature-pad-in-html-signature-pad-javascript-3866</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hello guys, today I am going to show you how to create a signature pad using HTML CSS &amp;amp; JavaScript, in this video, I will create a JavaScript signature pad using the signature pad JavaScript library.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#javascript-signature-pad-step-by-step"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  JavaScript signature pad step by step
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-1-creating-a-new-project"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 1 — Creating a New Project
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this step, we need to create a new project folder and files(index.html, style.css) for creating an awesome responsive website footer. In the next step, you will start creating the structure of the webpage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You may like these also:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.stackfindover.com/how-to-integrate-webcam-using-javascript/"&gt;How to Integrate Webcam using JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-2-setting-up-the-basic-structure"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 2 — Setting Up the basic structure
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this step, we will add the HTML code to create the basic structure of the project.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;html&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;lang=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"en"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;charset=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"UTF-8"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;http-equiv=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"X-UA-Compatible"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"IE=edge"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"viewport"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;How to create signature pad in html&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;rel=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"stylesheet"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"style.css"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is the base structure of most web pages that use HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the following code inside the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"flex-row"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"wrapper"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;canvas&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"signature-pad"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;width=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"400"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;height=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"200"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/canvas&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"clear-btn"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"clear"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; Clear &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;a href="#step-3-adding-styles-for-the-classes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 3 — Adding Styles for the Classes
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this step, we will add styles to the section class Inside style.css file&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;@import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sx"&gt;url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@300&amp;amp;display=swap')&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;'Poppins'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;sans-serif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;align-items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;justify-content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100vh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100vw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#ececec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;overflow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;hidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.flex-row&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.wrapper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;solid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#4b00ff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;canvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;#signature-pad&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#fff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;cursor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;crosshair&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;#clear&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#4b00ff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;solid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;transparent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#fff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;600&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;cursor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;pointer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;#clear&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rotate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;90deg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-4-adding-signature-pad-javascript-library-and-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 4 — Adding signature pad javascript library and code
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this step, we will add some javascript code to generate canvas and add the signature pad library.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/signature_pad/1.3.5/signature_pad.min.js"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;integrity=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"sha512-kw/nRM/BMR2XGArXnOoxKOO5VBHLdITAW00aG8qK4zBzcLVZ4nzg7/oYCaoiwc8U9zrnsO9UHqpyljJ8+iqYiQ=="&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;crossorigin=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"anonymous"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;referrerpolicy=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"no-referrer"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;canvas&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;signature-pad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

       &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;resizeCanvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ratio&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;devicePixelRatio&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class="nx"&gt;canvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;canvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;offsetWidth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ratio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class="nx"&gt;canvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;canvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;offsetHeight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ratio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class="nx"&gt;canvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;2d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;scale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ratio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ratio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="nb"&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;onresize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;resizeCanvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="nx"&gt;resizeCanvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

       &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;signaturePad&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;SignaturePad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;canvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;backgroundColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;rgb(250,250,250)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

       &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;clear&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;signaturePad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;clear&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

      <title>#100DaysOfCodeChallenge - Crop Management Information System - Day 4</title>
      <author>Curtly Critchlow</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 27 Jun 2021 03:42:14 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/curtlycritchlow/100daysofcodechallenge-crop-management-information-system-day-4-2i8l</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/curtlycritchlow/100daysofcodechallenge-crop-management-information-system-day-4-2i8l</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#recap"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Recap
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href="https://dev.to/curtlycritchlow/100daysofcodechallenge-crop-management-information-system-day-3-5b45"&gt;Day 3&lt;/a&gt; I created the Farmer registration form and highlighted the need for me to understand layout and constraints in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#overview"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Overview
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post we will pause building the Crop Management Information System and discuss layout and constraints using the Row and Column widget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#row-and-column"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Row and Column
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Row and Column are two of the most commonly used layout style, they both take a list of child widgets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two important terms to keep in mind when dealing with layout are Constraints and size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#constraints-vs-size"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Constraints vs Size
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constraints are concerned with minimum height, maximum height, minimum width and maximum width. Size is the actual height and width a widget takes up. To illustrate, the parent widget tells its children how big or small it can be, the child widget then decides what size it will take given the constraints provided by its parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Row and Column widgets are special. If they have constraints passed into it by its parents, they are as big as possible within those constraints. If no constraints are provided by its parents they will be as big as the combined size of its children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#infinite-size-error"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Infinite size error
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infinite size error is a common error occurrence when working with row and column. It occurs when the children of an unconstrained row or column is also unconstrained. This create a sort of circular reference, ie The column or row is trying to be as big as its children when the children are trying to be as big as the column or row.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In context of our Crop Management Information System app, this error occured when Placing a &lt;code&gt;TextFormField()&lt;/code&gt; widget inside a &lt;code&gt;Row()&lt;/code&gt; widget. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Gjy9ZoqG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://drive.google.com/uc%3Fid%3D1uPmdHiSXX34SxbJyy-d7V29XPL6nLwor" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Gjy9ZoqG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://drive.google.com/uc%3Fid%3D1uPmdHiSXX34SxbJyy-d7V29XPL6nLwor" alt="Farmer Form"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the &lt;code&gt;InputDecorator&lt;/code&gt; of the &lt;code&gt;TextFormField()&lt;/code&gt; has an unbound width while a row can be infinitely wide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common solution to the Infinite size error when using row and column is to wrap each unconstrained child in an &lt;a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Expanded-class.html"&gt;expanded widget&lt;/a&gt;. Your can read more about it in this &lt;a href="https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/layout"&gt;flutter article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#wrap-up"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Wrap Up
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When troubleshooting our code it is important to understand why the error occurred in the first place. The more we understand what is occurring "under the hood" of the flutter SDK the better equipped we are at troubleshooting our errors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My personal notes about requirement elicitation in unideal situations</title>
      <author>Jafet Benítez</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 27 Jun 2021 02:13:41 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/jafetbntz/my-personal-notes-about-requirement-elicitation-in-unideal-situations-5fj5</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/3oz8xTUmZABI3PGwDe/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/3oz8xTUmZABI3PGwDe/giphy.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/cute-craft-hand-made-3oz8xTUmZABI3PGwDe"&gt;via GIPHY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common mistake in the development industry is not paying attention to the requirements (functional and non-functional). Requirement elicitation and analysis are the very first step in software development but sometimes, in a bad implementation of agile methodologies, we can lose focus of that and end up building the wrong software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an ideal case, you would have someone to talk with users and customers, observe them and later write down what the business is requiring. Then, that person would sit down with the technical team to analyze requirements, business rules and make a plan for the implementation and validation. But, as I said before that is “ideally” and in countries where software engineering and requirement engineering are still growing as is mine,  sometimes you have to elucidate the requirements by yourself, analyze them and implement them with a very short deadline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember my first job. I was a 19 years old junior developer in a government organization working in ERP for the financial direction. We were a small team with lots of work, so our manager decided to assign us to different modules and do the elicitation of requirements by ourselves; later, we would check out our notes in one of our daily meetings. Initially, I didn’t feel in an ideal situation because of my lack of experience and maybe I wasn’t, but we had to make it work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized pretty soon that elicitation wasn’t as simple as I had thought during my classes in college. We had to deal with the short time of the actors, the ambiguity of the process, the actors with a tree-view mindset, and the resistance to change. Again, it wasn’t an ideal situation but had to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With time, I realized that rarely we can make an elicitation without troubles and that is ok, because, if the company hadn't problems they wouldn't have hired you to build the software in the first place. Through some time doing this kind of work, I have learned some lessons that I will leave you below. Anyway, if you want to go deeper into this topic, I highly recommend you to look at &lt;em&gt;The Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK Guide)&lt;/em&gt;. Said that, let’s go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#review-the-same-process-with-more-than-one-actor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Review the same process with more than one actor.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The user or actor usually knows how to do his work, but does not always know how the company works or even what his partner is doing on the desk that is by his side. Actors may ignore what happens with the process after they deliver the record and that’s why you have to listen to the process from the mouths of as many people as you can find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may find some power users that know the company pretty well or employees that were there when the process started working in that way. They are pretty helpful and you should pay attention to them, but to find them, you have to talk to several actors and put the ideas together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#people-may-not-be-technical-so-try-to-speak-his-language-and-dont-try-to-make-him-learn-yours"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  People may not be technical, so try to speak his language and don’t try to make him learn yours.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a noob in the field, I made the mistake of talking technically to the actors. As an analyst, you have to avoid getting too technical about the implementation instead of talking with the actors in terms of the business or even better, in terms the actor can understand easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better communication will get you more clarity. More clarity will lead you to better requirements and that will avoid having extra iterations or sprints because you already are making the right software from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#identify-priorities"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Identify priorities.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/DpSoj00vkPpswwZU9o/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/DpSoj00vkPpswwZU9o/giphy.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/theoffice-gphyoffice726-DpSoj00vkPpswwZU9o"&gt;via GIPHY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During elicitation, you will find more than one trouble and probably more problems than what your team can handle at once. This is why you have to identify priorities and talk them down with the owner of the process and with your superior. And that leads us to the next lessons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#validate-your-notes-with-a-mentor-andor-your-superior"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Validate your notes with a mentor and/or your superior.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably more for people starting in the area.  But even for experienced analysts, elicitation and analysis are more about having the right conversation with the right people than about having a brainstorm with yourself walking in circles in your office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Receiving another point of view it’s critical when you are trying to make a work with quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, notice that I’m talking about having not just a superior to check your notes with you, but also a mentor. If you are starting in the area, you may have noticed that there’s a lot of things you can learn by yourself but what most people don't say is that a mentor can save you a lot of headaches. Don’t you have one? Get one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#identify-improvement-opportunities"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Identify improvement opportunities.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The user and the client may tell you how they do things from the beginning of the time. They will describe the process they want you to systematize but they may lose improvement opportunities trying to be faithful to their day-to-day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s probably not your work but take into consideration that before making a system for a process, the company needs to optimize the process. You can always take notes and communicate with them. Be proactive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#remember-your-objective"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Remember your objective.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/MdGUUTVHk7s1BA5Pyk/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/MdGUUTVHk7s1BA5Pyk/giphy.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/bigbangtheory-season-1-episode-9-big-bang-theory-MdGUUTVHk7s1BA5Pyk"&gt;via GIPHY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not just building software for the company, it's solving problems of the company through software, so ask for the problems. Ask the different actors not just what they do and how things should be, but ask them about what kind of things usually go wrong and what happens then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#respect-people-process-owner-user-or-client-you-must-respect-them"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Respect people. Process owner, user, or client you must respect them.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we said before, while you are talking with several people you will notice that sometimes actors don’t have a holistic view of the company and its process and because of that, they may ask you for requirements that wouldn’t be right (mostly a matter of security). You will be tempted to make fun of the user and talk about “layer 8 problems”, or maybe of the client with something like “the customers know what they want but not what they need”, which may be true but you must have respect for them. The last thing you want is to have him as an enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that they aren’t supposed to know what you know. If that were the idea you wouldn’t have been hired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-if-people-dont-want-to-collaborate"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What if people don't want to collaborate?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/11qCjC856PSmnm/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/11qCjC856PSmnm/giphy.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/genius-albums-11qCjC856PSmnm"&gt;via GIPHY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, I didn’t want to go into this topic, but while I was reviewing this article with my friend Vanessa, she told me that it would sound too idyllic if I didn't give any advice about hard people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are all kinds of people in this world and there are people that will not collaborate with your elicitation, actors that can even get angry with you doing your work. These people require you to go the extra mile for them and try harder to get their collaboration but remember that you have to do it with sympathy and amiability. I remember that my boss used to buy chocolates for hateful people and most of the time that helped to make them know that you are trying to give a service for the company and the employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, if that doesn't work you will need to scale up the case or look for another person who can help you with that, but try to do that just as the last resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if there is something that I want you to remember, is that during elicitation you shouldn't fear finding troubles. Actually, you should try to remember that you are looking for the kind of problems that you can fix with software. Situations rarely are as we expected, they are not always ideal and that’s ok.&lt;/p&gt;
