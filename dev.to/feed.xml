      <title>7 Pieces of Bad Advice for Women in Engineering Leadership </title>
      <author>Conor Bronsdon</author>

      <link>https://dev.to/linearb/7-pieces-of-bad-advice-for-women-in-engineering-leadership-249l</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/linearb/7-pieces-of-bad-advice-for-women-in-engineering-leadership-249l</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Judy Johnson, a software engineer with over 35 years of experience, wrote the following article for &lt;a href="https://devinterrupted.com/7-pieces-of-bad-advice-for-women-in-engineering-leadership/"&gt;Dev Interrupted&lt;/a&gt; so I thought share. Please enjoy!&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
Have you ever attended an event in which you were asked to give advice to someone starting something new (career, baby, wedding)? Whenever confronted with that question, my answer is “don’t take people’s advice.” Not because all advice is bad, but because all people are different. I am unique, and some advice applies to me, and some not. Here are some of the items people have advised me, and why they may, or may not work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. “Don’t be too technical… or not technical enough.”&lt;/strong&gt; Both? Sure… I cannot tell you how many times when functioning as a systems engineer, I was told, “You know how developers are…” Well, yeah, I coded for many years. And how often do we hear that the stereotypical engineer should not be a manager because of social awkwardness or the inability to delegate? I feel that it helps a team to have someone with hands-on experience lead them — somewhere in the middle is the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. “Don’t bring treats to the office.”&lt;/strong&gt; I can’t tell you how many articles say that if you bake cookies you’ll never reach “the corner office.” Why not? I guess baking gives the impression of being a submissive woman. People play golf, collect baseball cards, even brew beer. It is a hobby. And I love to bake. I made the most amazing ginger molasses cookies for a birthday last year. (Recipe at the end of the article!) It is also a stress reduction technique for me. In a former job, we did a management simulation for a class. We found that one way to keep morale up was to feed your team. Overtime? Get pizzas! Celebrate birthdays and accomplishments! We did really well in that exercise (until we were confronted by a debilitating snowstorm). But if I’d listened to the bad advice of many people — I wouldn’t bring treats to the office!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7HRxS5Lq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/s0es15sqefo31a2vzox3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7HRxS5Lq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/s0es15sqefo31a2vzox3.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. “Be assertive.”&lt;/strong&gt; It is important to be assertive. And I am much more so than I was coming out of college. And maybe if I were better at saying no, I would not be writing this article… However, as the adage goes, “you catch more flies with honey than you do with vinegar.” On another note, there is something to be said for allyships, or the “good cop/bad cop” method. If I can keep the team happy and engaged, and someone else in the management chain or my tech lead may sometimes need to help me get a point across, would that be a bad idea? It shows teamwork and trust. Don’t over-index on assertiveness at the expense of collaboration and learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. “Shoot for the corner office.”&lt;/strong&gt; I have no desire to be in that space, figuratively or literally! I sit with my team and don’t mind interruptions (OK, maybe I need a “usually” on the interruptions). The past few assignments, I have been lucky enough to have the “Wal-Mart Greeter” desk, so I can be aware when people come by with issues, and I can experience the team banter. The idea of aiming at a corner office as a goal alienates you from team members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. “Working part-time hurts your career.”&lt;/strong&gt; I worked part-time for almost twenty years, and was home after every school day to make sure my daughters were fed, taken care of, and got their homework done. How did that affect my career? Well, I got fewer raises and fell behind my full-time colleagues. But I learned to multitask, I learned time management, and I ended up with two amazing strong daughters who followed in my footsteps to become engineers themselves. You get to decide what’s important for you — and working long hours is not always the right thing for many people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. “Don’t have interests outside of work.”&lt;/strong&gt; I am a big hockey fan, I read, I take nature walks and photos. I love live music, my favorite being metal. Again, how many stories do I have of people who think of me as a mellow music person (is it the cookies?) But, think about this, if you had a stressful day of work, and you are headed home in your car with the radio on, would it be more satisfying to hear, “You Don’t Bring me Flowers” or “I Sleep with One Eye Open?” You can guess my answer! Focusing solely on work will not only detract from your ability to connect with colleagues, it’ll create a life that you won’t fully enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---PIqJQs2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/o5f1lgc5vpx3921893co.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---PIqJQs2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/o5f1lgc5vpx3921893co.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. “Look like a manager.”&lt;/strong&gt; I will put it out there; not only am I female, but I am old, I am overweight, and I have blue hair. This is probably where I could go on a diversity rant. I’ll just say that the more uniform your team is, the more likely you’re missing out on some important outside-the-box ideas and perspectives. It’s far more important to be good at what you do and a strong team leader than to look the part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So next time you give or take advice, or assume you know the job of someone you see in the office or the grocery store, think about what makes us, us; not what about us makes us who we or others think we should be. Appearances aren’t everything — and listening to the wrong advice can be worse than not taking advice at all.&lt;br&gt;
 .&lt;br&gt;
 .&lt;br&gt;
 .&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;As promised, the delicious cookie recipe:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/lara-s-tender-gingersnaps/"&gt;Lara's Tender Gingersnaps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 cup packed brown sugar&lt;br&gt;
1–1/2 teaspoons ground ginger&lt;br&gt;
3/4 cup butter, melted&lt;br&gt;
1 teaspoon baking soda&lt;br&gt;
1 large egg, room temperature&lt;br&gt;
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon&lt;br&gt;
1/4 cup molasses&lt;br&gt;
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves&lt;br&gt;
2–1/4 cups all-purpose flour&lt;br&gt;
1/4 cup sugar&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Directions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a large bowl, beat brown sugar and butter until blended. Beat in egg and molasses. Combine the flour, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon and cloves; gradually add to brown sugar mixture and mix well (dough will be stiff). Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preheat oven to 350°. Shape dough into 1-in. balls. Roll in sugar. Place 2 in. apart on greased baking sheets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bake until set, 9–11 minutes. Cool for 1 minute before removing from pans to wire racks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nutrition Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Level Up Your Engineering Skills with an AWS Certification</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/giantmachines/how-to-level-up-your-engineering-skills-with-an-aws-certification-1n52</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0b3Y9Qsp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6donaovzsfes9is6tu85.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0b3Y9Qsp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6donaovzsfes9is6tu85.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past winter, I took the AWS Developer Associate certification exam because I wanted to gain a deeper understanding of DevOps and the AWS platform. In this blog, I'll cover what the certification is and why a software engineer would want to get it, how I prepared, the most important topics to study, and some interesting things I learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-aws-developer-associate-certification"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The AWS Developer Associate Certification
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who are not familiar with &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/"&gt;Amazon Web Services&lt;/a&gt; (AWS), the simplest way to describe it is a cloud-based environment where you can host your website or application along with data and asset storage for things like photos, videos, and documents. And it extends beyond that to services for machine learning, video processing, analytics, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of 2021, AWS is a very complex set of over 200 products and services. There are DevOps professionals who devote their entire careers just to AWS. But the certification I took is specifically geared towards software engineers who want to incorporate knowledge of AWS and DevOps principles into their everyday software-development work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why would a software engineer want to get this certification? Because the paths of a DevOps professional and a software engineer cross when the application built by a software engineer is ready to be deployed. Having knowledge of AWS services allows you to build cloud-first applications and explore different deployment options, which can greatly impact the speed and efficiency of your application and the financial cost of hosting it. And decoupled service-based cloud applications are replacing monolith applications generally, so software developers need to have knowledge of these cloud-based services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is the certification exam? At the time of writing there are 6 general &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/"&gt;AWS certifications&lt;/a&gt; and 5 specialty AWS certifications for software engineers, DevOps professionals, Network security professionals, etc. Each certification has a suggested number of years of experience you should have before taking it. The Developer Associate exam was the best fit for me because I already had more than one year of experience using AWS, and I am a software engineer looking to incorporate the certification knowledge into my everyday work. Engineers with no prior knowledge of AWS could start with the Certified Cloud Practitioner certification and then move up to the Developer Associate certification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exam has around 65 questions, all of which are multiple choice (some ask for one answer, and some ask you to select all that apply). The time limit was around 2 hours. You have the option to take the exam at home with a remote proctor who watches you through your camera or in-person at a local testing center. I took the exam during the COVID-19 pandemic, so I was glad they had an online version of the exam. At the time of writing, it costs $150 USD to take the exam (I used my Giant Machines education budget). The certification is valid for 3 years and then it will expire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#preparing-for-the-exam"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Preparing for the Exam
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hands-on experience is a must before taking any AWS certification exam. I had on-the-job training, but if your company is not using AWS there are many different courses and workshops available. One workshop a colleague of mine suggested was &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-associate-architect-developer-sysops-admin/"&gt;BackSpace Academy's AWS certification preparation course&lt;/a&gt; on Udemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading the AWS documentation is also a must, but reading through all of it would probably take years and be painfully boring! A great way to know which parts of the documentation to study is to take practice exams on &lt;a href="https://www.whizlabs.com/aws-developer-associate/"&gt;WhizLabs&lt;/a&gt;. I purchased the practice exam package. I would take an exam, see which questions I got wrong, and then WhizLabs provided the correct answer and the link to specific areas of the AWS documentation that I needed to study. I also watched this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrKRN9zRBWs&amp;amp;t=39514s"&gt;YouTube video&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ"&gt;freeCodeCamp.org&lt;/a&gt;, but not all in one sitting because it is 12 hours long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, AWS has over 200 services, but there are only 15 that you MUST know for the exam. These are &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/"&gt;DynamoDB&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/"&gt;Lambda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/"&gt;API Gateway&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/"&gt;KMS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/set-up-ci-cd-pipeline/"&gt;CI/CD&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/xray/"&gt;X-Ray&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/"&gt;SQS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sns"&gt;SNS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs"&gt;ECS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/"&gt;Cognito&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/"&gt;CloudWatch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/"&gt;Elastic Beanstalk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/"&gt;IAM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc"&gt;VPC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2"&gt;EC2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/"&gt;S3&lt;/a&gt;, and R2D2. (Just kidding about the last one—there are so many acronyms!) The service that has the most questions on the exam is DynamoDB, so make sure you are familiar with it inside and out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--S63AaJjL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/goaj0id61td1r8ped1yf.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--S63AaJjL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/goaj0id61td1r8ped1yf.gif" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;R2D2: Not the name of a real AWS service... yet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#learning-to-think-more-critically-about-architecture-and-pricing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Learning to Think More Critically About Architecture and Pricing
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most interesting things I learned while studying for this certification were from the questions that start with the phrases "what is the most cost efficient way to..." and "what is the easiest way to..." Not only did I learn about an AWS service, I also learned about cost-saving techniques where you spin up and tear down services as needed, so you only pay for services that are being actively used. (Businesses love cost savings!) These types of questions also helped me learn to compare the different AWS services and choose those which best fit the needs of the business and the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While studying, I also learned some very important application architecture design principles. For example, if you know that your application will need to process thousands of requests per minute, you should set up a &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/"&gt;Simple Queue Service&lt;/a&gt; to hold incoming requests and have the application process a certain number of requests from the queue at a time. This will prevent your server from running out of CPU and crashing because it can't handle the load.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also learned about how AWS services can be used to support some interesting business models. Take, for example, a company that provides tier-based pricing for their service, meaning that if you want faster service you must pay more. The company set up two Simple Queue Service queues, and the lower-tier requests were sent to one queue and the higher-tier requests to the other queue. The application would then process the items in both queues, but when an item came into the higher-tier queue, it would take priority over the items in the lower-tier queue. As a result, the higher-tier items would be processed faster than the lower-tier items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My experience getting the AWS Developer Associate certification was a positive one. I feel like it helps me out in my current role as a senior software engineer at Giant Machines because it has given me the ability to make important application architecture decisions. I am also able to provide guidance to clients on how to obtain the best performing and most cost-effective architectural solutions. And having an AWS certification on your resume helps you become recognized as an expert in these sorts of complex architectural and deployment issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love to hear from readers about your experience studying for and taking AWS (or other cloud providers') certification exams. Please leave a comment with the name of the certification exam you took. And it would be great if you could add a link to the study guide that you used, so others can research these options when they decide to take the exam. Feel free to ask questions regarding the exam as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Released v1.1 of Focus Wall!🥳</title>
      <author>Ayan S</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 06 Aug 2021 16:46:41 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/madebyayan/release-v1-1-of-my-product-555k</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/madebyayan/release-v1-1-of-my-product-555k</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Focus Wall is a tool that lets you keep all your todos right in your wallpaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the initial release of Focus Wall, there have been a slew of changes made to it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest of them being Notifications!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now get notification for todos that have an upcoming deadline, so you never miss another deadline. Not only that, but you can also customize as to when you'd like to receive your notification, whether it be at the deadline, a few minutes prior or several days before it, it's all upto you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When  you're done with a task, you can now choose to hide it from the wallpaper so it doesn't distract you from the things that you need to do next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with these, a variety of new wallpaper backgrounds have been added so you can further customize the experience to your taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also now see the number of number items in each lists with a glance so you know exactly how many things you need to focus on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from these new features, several bugs that had been identified or reported have now been fixed to provide a better experience to you in your productivity journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these new changes to Focus Wall, a Lite version of the app has also been released for people who'd like to give it a try and dive into Focus Wall. You can check it out here: &lt;a href="https://madebyayan.itch.io/focuswall-lite"&gt;madebyayan.itch.io/focuswall-lite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Deploy Strapi on AWS/GCP/Digital Ocean using Porter</title>
      <author>Trevor Shim</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 06 Aug 2021 16:39:42 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/porter/deploy-strapi-on-aws-gcp-digital-ocean-using-porter-185l</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/porter/deploy-strapi-on-aws-gcp-digital-ocean-using-porter-185l</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#intro"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Intro
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://porter.run"&gt;Porter&lt;/a&gt; is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) that runs in your own cloud provider. It brings the convenience of platforms like Heroku, Netlify, and Vercel into a cloud provider of your choice. Under the hood, Porter runs on top of a Kubernetes cluster but abstracts away its complexity to the extent that you don't even have to know that it's running on Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sl832hQu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gbk9cevvor7amkjygo05.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sl832hQu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gbk9cevvor7amkjygo05.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a quick guide on how to deploy &lt;a href="https://strapi.io"&gt;Strapi&lt;/a&gt; to a Kubernetes cluster in AWS/GCP/DO using Porter. This guide uses PostgresDB by default - to customize your database settings, modify the files in &lt;code&gt;/app/config/env/production&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/porter-dev/strapi"&gt;example repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#quick-deploy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Quick Deploy
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an account on &lt;a href="https://dashboard.getporter.dev"&gt;Porter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://docs.porter.run/docs/getting-started-with-porter-on-aws"&gt;One-click provision a Kubernetes cluster&lt;/a&gt; in a cloud provider of your choice, or &lt;a href="https://docs.porter.run/docs/cli-documentation#connecting-to-an-existing-cluster"&gt;connect an existing cluster&lt;/a&gt; if you have one already.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fork &lt;a href="https://github.com/porter-dev/strapi"&gt;this repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the &lt;a href="https://dashboard.getporter.dev/launch"&gt;Launch tab&lt;/a&gt;, navigate to &lt;strong&gt;Web Service &amp;gt; Deploy from Git Repository&lt;/strong&gt;. Then select the forked repository and &lt;code&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt; in the root directory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configure the port to &lt;code&gt;1337&lt;/code&gt; and set environment variable to &lt;code&gt;NODE_ENV=production&lt;/code&gt;. Depending on your database settings, you might want to add more environment variables. More on this in the section below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the assigned resources to Strapi's &lt;a href="https://strapi.io/documentation/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/deployment.html#general-guidelines"&gt;recommended settings&lt;/a&gt; (i.e. 2048Mi RAM, 1000 CPU), then hit deploy!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5-GYqXWR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yem2y6d5gi4gik45on99.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5-GYqXWR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yem2y6d5gi4gik45on99.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-08-06 at 11.25.41 AM"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#deploying-postgresdb"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Deploying PostgresDB
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strapi instance deployed through Porter connects to a PostgresDB by default. You can connect Strapi instance deployed on Porter to any external database, but it is also possible to connect to a database that is deployed on Porter. Follow &lt;a href="https://docs.getporter.dev/docs/postgresdb"&gt;this guide to deploy a PostgresDB instance to your cluster in one click&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the database has been deployed, navigate to the &lt;strong&gt;Environment Variables&lt;/strong&gt; tab of your deployed Strapi instance. Configure the following environment variables:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_HOST=
DATABASE_PORT=5432
DATABASE_NAME=
DATABASE_USERNAME=
DATABASE_PASSWORD=
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To determine what the correct environment variables are in order to connect to the deployed database, &lt;a href="https://docs.getporter.dev/docs/postgresdb#connecting-to-the-database"&gt;see this guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#development"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Development
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To develop, clone the &lt;a href="https://github.com/porter-dev/strapi"&gt;example repository&lt;/a&gt; to your local environment and run &lt;code&gt;npm install &amp;amp;&amp;amp; npm run develop;&lt;/code&gt; from the &lt;code&gt;app&lt;/code&gt; directory. Porter will automatically handle CI/CD and propagate your changes to production on every push to the repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#questions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Questions?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join the &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/FaaFjb6DXA"&gt;Porter Discord community&lt;/a&gt; if you have any questions or need help.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Measuring Developers Isn’t Tyranny </title>
      <author>Nick Hodges</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 06 Aug 2021 16:38:38 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/linearb/measuring-developers-isn-t-tyranny-2nm5</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/linearb/measuring-developers-isn-t-tyranny-2nm5</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#measuring-developers-isnt-tyranny"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Measuring Developers Isn’t Tyranny
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Informing someone that you want to “measure” them is not a great way to start a conversation. Software developers, like all people, tend to look unfavorably upon having their performance closely measured. But measuring developers is one of the hottest trends for companies around the globe. So is it tyranny to measure people?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are quick to note that numbers don’t tell the whole story and can become defensive at the notion their productivity should be quantified somehow. This resistance can become even more entrenched when teams become stacked against each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many leaders — &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTYPIxG5Esc"&gt;like Netflix’s Kathryn Koehler &lt;/a&gt;— believe we should absolutely avoid stack ranking of individuals and teams. After all, the human elements of teams — communication, coordination, leadership — can all affect the speed or perceived productivity of a team or process, so how can you quantify that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, plenty of tools exist to enable a data-driven approach to the development process. With the right approach, these tools can be used to enhance any individual’s or team’s performance. Beyond performance, when applied correctly, these tools can bring about more harmonious alignment between leadership and employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first, why do we measure?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-measure-at-all"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why measure at all?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to remember that &lt;a href="https://refactoring.fm/p/why-you-should-measure-your-development"&gt;measuring is just a tool &lt;/a&gt;— it can be used for both good and for evil. An effective leadership team understands this basic fact. The cool thing about metrics is that they provide insight that might otherwise be difficult to obtain. Employees should note that good leadership will use metrics merely to inform their decisions, not solely drive them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a basic rule, it is difficult to improve something that is not measured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I started with the really basic observation that I believe you cannot be sure that you’re improving something if you don’t measure it, right? I mean, think of trying to lose weight without weighing yourself."&lt;/em&gt; -Luca Rossi, from the &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Rz970JfT6lYdAVNRZvRMz?si=wFgoIHxLTQWI6JBQJtZn9g&amp;amp;dl_branch=1"&gt;Dev Interrupted Podcast at 4:31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="100%" height="232px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/3Rz970JfT6lYdAVNRZvRMz"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measuring creates a foundation — a benchmark — which can be built upon. Once this foundation is established, organizations can begin to set goals. If you can set goals, you can rally a team; and if you can rally a team, you can achieve your product goals. This all becomes easier when you adopt a quantitative approach to your process. Success flows from the foundational element that measuring provides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, there exists a psychological benefit to measuring: namely, that people implicitly understand that metrics which are measured are important. After all, no one measures something they don’t care about. That which leadership identifies as measurable naturally informs employees what metrics leadership thinks are important. The very act of deciding to measure something telegraphs your intentions. Inversely, the opposite is also true: people tend to believe what is not measured is not important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this means leadership should be careful to identify what metrics are important because they define your organization and its behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-should-be-measured"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What should be measured?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, an organization must decide what metrics are worthy and whether or not they are actionable. A lean approach is best here. Decide what does and does not matter to you, and then move confidently in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what metrics are worthy to an engineering team?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many valid metrics which include things like &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://linearb.io/blog/5-ways-to-deliver-and-accelerate-engineering-velocity/"&gt;Velocity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://linearb.io/blog/what-is-branch-coverage/"&gt;Branch Coverage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://linearb.io/cycle-time/"&gt;Cycle Time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, but one of the most interesting metrics we care about at LinearB is the Pull Request. In fact, &lt;a href="https://devinterrupted.com/pesky-pull-request-totally-worth-it/"&gt;it’s kind of our thing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pull request has two major goals: the first is to improve the quality of code before you release it, while the second is to share knowledge between the team about the code base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://devinterrupted.com/pesky-pull-request-totally-worth-it/"&gt;Pull Requests are great&lt;/a&gt; because they let your team have control over what goes into git; they let people comment about what and why things were done a certain way; and they can serve as permanent documentation about a chunk of code that can be useful down the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hqXcpQj7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0%2Am32SNRAQP5f_WKIA.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hqXcpQj7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0%2Am32SNRAQP5f_WKIA.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we at LinearB were to recommend one metric to start measuring, it would be Pull Request Size. Measuring PR Size — and using that measurement to encourage smaller Pull Requests — will help drastically lower Cycle Time. It will encourage all kinds of good behavior around code reviews, and it will prove that metrics can have a positive impact on business outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have identified the best metrics to track for your success, you will need to go about making sure they last. Here it is best to maintain a lean approach, avoiding large upfront investments of time or money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-make-metrics-stick"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to make metrics stick
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yn3ZUVSB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ma035yrvfkmlbjq1mapx.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yn3ZUVSB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ma035yrvfkmlbjq1mapx.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"And you should, as a leader, as a manager, you should make people feel that you care. There is no substitute for that."&lt;/em&gt; — Luca Rossi, from the &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Rz970JfT6lYdAVNRZvRMz?si=wFgoIHxLTQWI6JBQJtZn9g&amp;amp;dl_branch=1"&gt;Dev Interrupted Podcast at 21:10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have all worked at a company where a change was decided, people were excited to see the change and then, after a couple of months, everyone has forgotten about it. Metrics are no different. Once a company makes the decision to align itself with a metric it must make the effort for it to last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s often best to start small. In the beginning, it is best to maintain a lean approach, avoiding large upfront investments of time or money. With small actionable change in mind, there are two ways to approach metrics adoption:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;strong&gt;top-down approach&lt;/strong&gt; you ‘ll want to speak with your senior developers early on. Give them strategic input to help them figure out the best way to implement metrics into your dev team. An engineering leader can then explain how the metrics fit into the company’s strategic direction and convey that message clearly to employees. It is important to get buy-in from your employees because they are the ones building value, and further discovering what can and should be measured. When done correctly, the top-down approach will have managers saying, “Wow, I’ve always wanted to measure this. Now I can.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;strong&gt;bottom-up approach&lt;/strong&gt;, it’s all about making your team understand what you want to achieve. Provide them with the initiative to build value so they understand why and how they are being measured. For instance, most developers can relate to a bad pull request experience — one that takes way too long or one that has a poor review and causes issues during production. People understand that a good code review should be both fast and accurate. So by starting small with a metric that is already understood, you will gain buy-in from your team. When done correctly, the bottom-up approach will have employees saying, “Wow, we didn’t think we could measure this, and it’s actually valuable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How you approach adjusting for change in the long-term is up to you. In an ideal world, both the top-down and bottom-up approaches would be utilized simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, your people should know that you care and that you value their feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#bottom-line"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Bottom Line
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve future goals a development team should know where it started. Metrics provide that benchmark. They are a foundation on which future success and business alignment can be built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, in engineering, just as in life, tiny improvements are staggering when tracked continuously over a period of months and years. These gains boost team confidence and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because with continual improvement, people feel as if they are working within a team and working &lt;em&gt;as a team&lt;/em&gt;. When things go right, and everyone improves together, bonds are formed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, if you want to learn more about &lt;a href="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/17-Metrics-for-Modern-Dev-Leaders.pdf"&gt;LinearB’s metrics &lt;/a&gt;or find out what our customers already know, you can &lt;a href="https://linearb.io/demo/?utm_source=Referrals&amp;amp;utm_medium=devinterrupted.com&amp;amp;utm_campaign=devinterrupted%20referrals"&gt;book a free demo of LinearB &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I included a few quotes from Luca Rossi above. He has a great blog for those who are passionate about engineering. You can check it out here: &lt;a href="https://refactoring.fm/"&gt;https://refactoring.fm/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-intermediate-course-day-4-summary-of-the-week-guidelines-for-recursion-and-high-level-questions-445</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#today-we-will-study-principles-of-recursion-and-then-solve-questions-related-to-recursion-this-is-the-continuation-of-the-last-part-so-in-case-you-have-missed-that-one-make-sure-to-have-a-quick-check-here"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Today we will study principles of recursion and then solve questions related to recursion. This is the continuation of the last part, so in case you have missed that one, make sure to have a quick check &lt;a href="https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-intermediate-course-day-3-recursion-in-python-41ff"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#summary-of-the-week"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Summary of the week-
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-intermediate-course-day-1-user-defined-functions-1kg7"&gt;Day 1&lt;/a&gt; We learnt how to make user defined functions. User defined functions are custom  functions designed by the programmer. They provide code reusability and flexibility while solving complicated problems. All this was backed up with two sample questions and one conceptual exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-intermediate-course-day-2-returning-values-from-methods-4bhn"&gt;Day 2&lt;/a&gt; We learnt how to return values from functions. By breaking complicated operations into functions, we can make the code more compact and flexible. This is possible because we can return data-types back to the function call. Returning multiple values is invalid, but we can return a list which can hold the values. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-intermediate-course-day-3-recursion-in-python-41ff"&gt;Day 3&lt;/a&gt; We studied recursion in Python. We implemented it by calling the function from inside it. We then solved some good questions related to recursion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#guidelines-for-using-recursion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Guidelines for using recursion.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recursion is a tool to allow programmer to concentrate on the key step of an algorithm, without initially having to worry about how to couple that step with the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recursion is basically breaking apart a problem into parts, solving a single part and the while problem gets solved magically. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider an example. We want to find the shortest path to a city. So first, we find shortest paths to all it's neighboring cities, and then choose the route which is smallest. And how do we find the shortest path to the neighboring cities? Well in the same way! This is the beauty of recursion. We can address a complicated problem by making smaller replicas to the main problem on and forever! This is known as the travelling salesman problem, which we solved using recursion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We first start any problem by asking &lt;em&gt;"How can this problem be divided into parts?"&lt;/em&gt; Once we have a simple short step to solve a mini-problem of the same type, applying it to a larger problem is easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally we need to decide a stopping rule to prevent the recursion from running indefinitely. For example in the above problem, we stop when we reach to the city from where we have to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#exercises"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Exercises
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Greatest Common Divisor&lt;/em&gt; (GCD) of two positive integers is the largest integer that divides both of the two integers. Thus, the GCD of 8 and 12 is 4, the GCD of 9 and 18 is 9, and the GCD of 16 and 25 is 1. Write a recursive function namd &lt;code&gt;GCD (x,y)&lt;/code&gt; that implements this &lt;em&gt;division algorithm&lt;/em&gt;: if y=0, then the GCD of x and y is x; otherwise the GCD of x and y is the same as the GCD of y and x%y. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The binomial coefficients may be defined by the following recurrence relation, which is the idea of the pascal's triangle.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;C(n,0)=1 and C(n,n)=1 for n&amp;gt;=0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;C(n,k)=C(n-1,k)+C(n-1,k-1) for n&amp;gt;k&amp;gt;0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Write a recursive function which will generate C(n,k) by using the above formula&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Ackermann's function&lt;/em&gt;, defined as follows, is a standered device to determine how well recursion is implemented in any device.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;A(0,n)=n+1                for n&amp;gt;=0
A(m,0)=A(m-1,1)           for m&amp;gt;0
A(m,n)=A(m-1,A(m,n-1))    for m&amp;gt;0 and n&amp;gt;0 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the above exercises are a bit difficult. But the key is finding C(n,k) or A(m,n) and directly implementing it. The rest is just about when to stop the recursion conditions. All the best for solving them! Solving these exercises will make you all fluent with recursion and it's problem solving  principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#all-answers-here"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://github.com/Aatmaj-Zephyr/Learning-Python"&gt;All Answers here&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A bit about the course&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I know, I am going a bit slow for some of you.  But this is for the benifit of those who are here for the first time. This week was a gentle intro to user defined functions. In the coming weeks, I will cover all the details of the language. For those who already know coding basics, they can just skim through the blog and mull upon the exercises. The exercises provided will strengthen and reinforce the concepts. Moreover they are directly taken or similar to past coding tests from the interview panel...&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epilogue&lt;/em&gt;- We all know that neither me nor you have ever seen each other. Learning in remote environment is a difficult, and teaching is perhaps even more difficult. Teaching is never a one-way process. When a teacher teaches with pattern, he/she expects that the student must respond back. Either with doubts, remarks or nods of approval.&lt;br&gt;
But friends, being remote, we cannot interact with each other. The only way we can connect is through the comments below. So I urge everyone to comment on the posts. Currently I am in doubt whether you all are understanding me or not. Should I speed up the pace or maybe explain more clearly? I am not getting any feedback from you. Any doubts, discussions, remarks or even a simple hi from you is a great source of motivation for me. So I look forward to your comments below...😊&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For those who have not yet made account in Dev.to, you can have a free easy sign-up using your mail or GitHub accounts. I would suggest the budding developers to create your GitHub free account right away. You would require to register sooner or later anyways&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Launching Bakup.io - Is your data safe? 💾</title>
      <author>Luke Embrey</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 06 Aug 2021 16:32:32 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/embluk/launching-bakup-io-is-your-data-safe-1a93</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/embluk/launching-bakup-io-is-your-data-safe-1a93</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/luke_embrey"&gt;me&lt;/a&gt; and my co-founder &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/danielashare"&gt;@danielashare&lt;/a&gt; launched &lt;a href="https://Bakup.io"&gt;Bakup.io&lt;/a&gt; and I thought I would share my experience and what &lt;a href="https://Bakup.io"&gt;Bakup.io&lt;/a&gt; is all about with the Dev.to community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-bakupio"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Bakup.io? 🏰
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://Bakup.io"&gt;Bakup.io&lt;/a&gt; is a fully managed solution for database, file and server backups. The platform interacts with your cloud servers and automatically performs backup jobs for you. Kind of like cron-jobs but more advanced, has error checking and easier to manage/maintain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, &lt;a href="https://Bakup.io"&gt;Bakup.io&lt;/a&gt; has a wide array of features that are desirable for a full backup solution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MySQL Backups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PostgreSQL Backups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MongoDB Backups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File &amp;amp; Directory Backups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retention Policies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secret Management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Snapshot Backups (Hetzner, DO, AWS etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Geo Redundant Backups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Triple Replication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backup Restores&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Server Monitoring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;100% data ownership&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple Storage Providers Supported&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-bit-about-us"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A bit about us 🇬🇧
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sJwjZSrQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vdwxzfqpe2go90c0nnrf.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sJwjZSrQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vdwxzfqpe2go90c0nnrf.png" alt="About the founders image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-not-run-your-own-bakups"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why not run your own bakups? 😬
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We built &lt;a href="https://Bakup.io"&gt;Bakup.io&lt;/a&gt; based around the already available tools you can use to backup everything yourself, so while you could do everything yourself, it is a very daunting task, complicated to manage and not easy to keep everything compatible. That is why we built &lt;a href="https://Bakup.io"&gt;Bakup.io&lt;/a&gt;, wouldn't you rather get back to the core focus of your product or service rather than worry about data backups?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Nmd_Vm87--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qnp6llfo48kdxrmpo526.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Nmd_Vm87--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qnp6llfo48kdxrmpo526.png" alt="Bakup.io features"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our platform takes away the stress around making sure a companies data is properly backed up, it ensures you have a recovery strategy ready in case a data disaster happens, hopefully it never will! - But you never know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#core-motivation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Core Motivation 🏃‍♀️
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dan and myself built &lt;a href="https://Bakup.io"&gt;Bakup.io&lt;/a&gt; because data is becoming more and more important to us, we wanted a solid way to make sure we protect all our customers data with one platform to handle it all. After coming up with this idea, we wanted to share a solution which helps thousands of other developers secure their users data and let founders, engineers, developers and marketers focus on their core product, not data management and backup tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#where-does-bakupio-fit-in-my-startup-or-business"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Where does Bakup.io fit in my startup or business? 🙌
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are building or running a startup, the last thing you want to worry about is securely and properly performing database, file or server backups, but it is essential. Losing customer data can be detrimental to your core business, protect it with a proper long term solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are alternative open source solutions for data backup out there. However, they are not fully managed, if your company has large amounts of user data or important data, you'll want a solution which is always monitored and kept &lt;strong&gt;up-to-date&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;dedicated support&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DJ7ePXmC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/t07kxxvr633tmx2k9ai5.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DJ7ePXmC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/t07kxxvr633tmx2k9ai5.png" alt="Bakup.io main features"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-does-it-work"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How does it work? 🔍
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://Bakup.io"&gt;Bakup.io&lt;/a&gt; is more secure and enterprise friendly compared to other solutions out there. We take pride in utilising a light-weight C++ agent, this agent runs in the background on your server and periodically contacts &lt;a href="https://Bakup.io"&gt;Bakup.io&lt;/a&gt; for jobs, everything is then executed on your server (for database or file backups).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your data is only ever transferred from &lt;strong&gt;your&lt;/strong&gt; server/network, we &lt;strong&gt;never collect&lt;/strong&gt; your data and we &lt;strong&gt;never transfer&lt;/strong&gt; any data through our network. You have &lt;strong&gt;100% data ownership&lt;/strong&gt; as you choose the storage provider, this can be something like FTP, SFTP, AWS S3 etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agent method is great because it means you don't need to expose a data sensitive server to the internet, the agent only need permission for outgoing requests to &lt;a href="https://Bakup.io"&gt;Bakup.io&lt;/a&gt;. This means that you can lock your database server behind a secure network, we &lt;strong&gt;do not&lt;/strong&gt; rely on needing SSH access like some backup solutions require.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our agent is also open source, you can view the project on &lt;a href="https://github.com/Superbition/Bakup-Agent"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Yc63SJ6P--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wod8r5vkhtqh90y15pfj.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Yc63SJ6P--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wod8r5vkhtqh90y15pfj.png" alt="Supported platforms at Bakup.io"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ease-of-use-and-longterm-maintainability"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Ease of Use and long-term maintainability 🥇
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our main goal was to build a solution where you don't need to interact with it much, we believe once you setup backup jobs, you shouldn't regularly need to maintain something. After you have got a backup job working correctly, you can enjoy knowing that your data is in good hands, you can be easily notified if something is wrong. You can get notifications via Email, Slack, SMS etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything at &lt;a href="https://Bakup.io"&gt;Bakup.io&lt;/a&gt; is focused around security, we know it is very important, we always take advantage of battle tested protocols and encryption standards. Our agent can detect unsecure connections and thus will not communicate unless a secure encryption tunnel is established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-complete-enterprise-solution"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A complete enterprise solution 💯
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though we started off focusing on database backups we support different backup practices and types. We are focused on being a complete solution for data management and backups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bLmn5-DN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u7spjv73alj1rmbwl6yj.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bLmn5-DN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u7spjv73alj1rmbwl6yj.png" alt="List of other features"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are a self-serve solution for small to large businesses and enterprise customers who want a complete solution to data management. We also are a good start for solo-devs or start-ups looking to adopt good practices from the beginning with data backups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BM7Mf7Br--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7u1jz1mj2payggj580xr.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BM7Mf7Br--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7u1jz1mj2payggj580xr.png" alt="Bakup.io meme"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/rizkyrajitha/setting-up-prometheus-and-grafana-on-orange-pi-zero-5e8n</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a tutorial I am going to walk through how to install and configure an Orange Pi Zero with &lt;a href="https://prometheus.io/"&gt;Prometheus&lt;/a&gt;  and  &lt;a href="https://grafana.com/"&gt;Grafana&lt;/a&gt; for monitoring hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am using &lt;a href="http://www.orangepi.org/orangepizero/"&gt;Orange pi zero&lt;/a&gt; in this tutorial with AllWinner H2 Quad-core processor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start by updating the Orange pi.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;apt-get update
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I first installed downloaded the Prometheus from their &lt;a href="https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.28.1"&gt;github&lt;/a&gt; release. because my orangepi is base on arm7 architecture I downloaded the respective archive. here &lt;code&gt;-OL&lt;/code&gt; in the curl will redirect if need and save the output file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-OL&lt;/span&gt; https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.28.1/prometheus-2.28.1.linux-armv7.tar.gz
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;after downloading the image extract it to a folder.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;tar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-xzvf&lt;/span&gt; prometheus-2.29.0-rc.0.linux-armv7.tar.gz prometheus-2.29.0-rc.0.linux-armv7/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;next, I copied the Prometheus binary to the &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/bin/&lt;/code&gt; because that I generally where your binary files live in.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;prometheus-2.29.0-rc.0.linux-armv7/
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cp &lt;/span&gt;prometheus /usr/local/bin/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;after all that was set up, I created a service file for &lt;code&gt;systemd&lt;/code&gt; to configure Prometheus as a service in &lt;code&gt;/etc/systemd/system/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
this directory is where we write &lt;code&gt;systemd&lt;/code&gt; unit files. there are many places among this one but this I a conventional directory that is best suited in this scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/prometheus.service&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;[Unit]
Description=Prometheus monitoring
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/prometheus \
                    --config.file /home/batman/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
                    --web.route-prefix=/ \
                    --web.external-url=http://rizky.lab/prometheus
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;in this file, I have added the &lt;code&gt;ExecStart&lt;/code&gt; path to the Prometheus binary. here I also added some more arguments to configure Prometheus, because I want to run Prometheus behind an Nginx reverse proxy. and also added the config file in path &lt;code&gt;/home/batman/prometheus/prometheus.yml&lt;/code&gt; so make sure you have the default &lt;code&gt;prometheus.yml&lt;/code&gt; (comes with the &lt;code&gt;tar&lt;/code&gt; archive) file in the specified path.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;after that is done. I restarted the systemd daemon and then enable the service.&lt;br&gt;
enabling service will make sure that this service will run after a reboot. it might do many other things behind the back but I notice this when I used this service without enabling it.&lt;br&gt;
next stared Prometheus.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;systemctl daemon-reload
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;systemctl &lt;span class="nb"&gt;enable &lt;/span&gt;prometheus
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;systemctl restart prometheus
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;systemctl status prometheus
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;next, we can start installing the &lt;a href="https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/tag/v1.2.0"&gt;node_exporter&lt;/a&gt; for orange pi&lt;br&gt;
here also, I looked the same way, searched for the &lt;code&gt;armv7&lt;/code&gt; architecture binary.&lt;br&gt;
just as before download extract and copy it to the &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/bin/&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-OL&lt;/span&gt; https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v1.2.0/node_exporter-1.2.0.linux-armv7.tar.gz
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;tar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-xzvf&lt;/span&gt; node_exporter-1.2.0.linux-armv7.tar.gz node_exporter-1.2.0.linux-armv7/
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;node_exporter-1.2.0.linux-armv7/
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo cp &lt;/span&gt;node_exporter  /usr/local/bin/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;next, I repeated the same steps for creating the unit file for systemd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/nodeexporter.service&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;[Unit]
Description=node exporter for node monitoring
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/node_exporter
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;after setting up the node_exporter , reload systemd daemon and restarted node_exporter.&lt;br&gt;
keep in mind the service will name after the name of the service file. here node_exporter service will be recognized as nodeexporter because I named the unit file &lt;code&gt;nodeexporter.service&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;systemctl daemon-reload
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;systemctl &lt;span class="nb"&gt;enable &lt;/span&gt;nodeexporter
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;systemctl restart nodeexporter
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;systemctl status nodeexporter
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;now that we have all in place, next add this nodeexporter to Prometheus as a target. to do that we need to edit the&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;prometheus.yml&lt;/code&gt; file we specified earlier. I appended the following to the &lt;code&gt;prometheus.yml&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;job_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;node_exporter"&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="na"&gt;static_configs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;targets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pi"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;localhost:9100"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;after that restart, Prometheus to catch up with new changes. you can see the change at this point if you visit Prometheus via its opened port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;after that, I set up &lt;a href="//grafana.com/"&gt;Grafana&lt;/a&gt; for the monitoring dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Grafana, it's a bit different than the last approach, hence it could be installed with apt.&lt;br&gt;
I pretty much followed they're &lt;a href="https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/debian/"&gt;offcial documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;wget &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-q&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-O&lt;/span&gt; - https://packages.grafana.com/gpg.key | &lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;apt-key add -
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"deb https://packages.grafana.com/oss/deb stable main"&lt;/span&gt; | &lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo tee&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-a&lt;/span&gt; /etc/apt/sources.list.d/grafana.list
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;apt-get update
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;apt-get &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-y&lt;/span&gt; grafana
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;systemctl demon-reload
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;systemctl &lt;span class="nb"&gt;enable &lt;/span&gt;grafana-server
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;systemctl start grafana-server
systemctl status grafana-server
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;hereafter setting up everything I need to alter come configurations in the &lt;code&gt;grafana.ini&lt;/code&gt; file to allow Grafana to access behind a reverse proxy.&lt;br&gt;
this Grafana file lives in &lt;code&gt;/etc/grafana&lt;/code&gt; directory by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in that configuration we have to set &lt;code&gt;domain&lt;/code&gt; , &lt;code&gt;root_url&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;serve_from_sub_path&lt;/code&gt; options.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ini"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;[server]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;# The public facing domain name used to access grafana from a browser
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="py"&gt;domain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;rizky.lab&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# The full public facing url you use in browser, used for redirects and emails
# If you use reverse proxy and sub path specify full url (with sub path)
# ;root_url = %(protocol)s://%(domain)s:%(http_port)s/
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="py"&gt;root_url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;%(protocol)s://%(domain)s:%(http_port)s/grafana/&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Serve Grafana from subpath specified in `root_url` setting. By default it is set to `false` for compatibility reasons.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="py"&gt;serve_from_sub_path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;after setting this up, restart Grafana to pick up with the latest changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;now as the last step configure the Nginx as the reverse proxy to access our all mighty Grafana dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;here I previously configured a site as &lt;code&gt;rizky.lab&lt;/code&gt; , so I am editing that to suit the needs, but you can try any way you like.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight conf"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;server&lt;/span&gt; {
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;80&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;default_server&lt;/span&gt;;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt; [::]:&lt;span class="m"&gt;80&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;default_server&lt;/span&gt;;

  &lt;span class="n"&gt;root&lt;/span&gt; /&lt;span class="n"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="n"&gt;www&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="n"&gt;rizky&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="n"&gt;lab&lt;/span&gt;;

  &lt;span class="n"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="n"&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;;

  &lt;span class="n"&gt;server_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rizky&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="n"&gt;lab&lt;/span&gt;;

         &lt;span class="n"&gt;location&lt;/span&gt; /&lt;span class="n"&gt;prometheus&lt;/span&gt;/ {
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;proxy_pass&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;://&lt;span class="n"&gt;localhost&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="m"&gt;9090&lt;/span&gt;/;
        }


        &lt;span class="n"&gt;location&lt;/span&gt; /&lt;span class="n"&gt;grafana&lt;/span&gt;/ {
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;proxy_pass&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;://&lt;span class="n"&gt;localhost&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="m"&gt;3000&lt;/span&gt;/;
        }

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;location&lt;/span&gt; / {

                &lt;span class="n"&gt;try_files&lt;/span&gt; $&lt;span class="n"&gt;uri&lt;/span&gt; $&lt;span class="n"&gt;uri&lt;/span&gt;/ =&lt;span class="m"&gt;404&lt;/span&gt;;
        }

        &lt;span class="c"&gt;# Proxy Grafana Live WebSocket connections.
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="n"&gt;location&lt;/span&gt; /&lt;span class="n"&gt;grafana&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="n"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="n"&gt;live&lt;/span&gt; {
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;proxy_http_version&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;;
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;proxy_set_header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Upgrade&lt;/span&gt; $&lt;span class="n"&gt;http_upgrade&lt;/span&gt;;
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;proxy_set_header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Connection&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Upgrade"&lt;/span&gt;;
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;proxy_set_header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Host&lt;/span&gt; $&lt;span class="n"&gt;http_host&lt;/span&gt;;
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;proxy_pass&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;://&lt;span class="n"&gt;localhost&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="m"&gt;3000&lt;/span&gt;/;
        }

}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;and after all that, we can access the all mighty Grafana Dashboard, and configure it as you wish.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pGe7CDzs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kzwobntu88og2s8axpuu.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pGe7CDzs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kzwobntu88og2s8axpuu.png" alt="Grafana Dashboard"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  Thanks for reading till the end 🙌
&lt;/h3&gt;

      <title>Should You Really Learn Vanilla JavaScript Before React?</title>
      <author>Nico Zerpa (he/him)</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 06 Aug 2021 16:08:07 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/nicozerpa/should-you-really-learn-vanilla-javascript-before-react-3lec</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;"Learn the basics before you learn React", they say. But if you're a beginner who's learning with React first, you probably start to worry. You might start asking if you're learning everything the wrong way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is, &lt;strong&gt;if you're learning React before the basics, chances are that you're doing it right.&lt;/strong&gt; And that's because it all boils down to your personal learning style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, &lt;strong&gt;devs can learn things in two ways: bottom-up and top-down.&lt;/strong&gt; A bottom-up learner feels more comfortable learning the basics (i.e. JavaScript, HTML, or CSS) first. They only start learning the libraries after they feel confident with the fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, a top-down learner prefers learning the frameworks first. The framework patterns help them learn the fundamental libraries and languages under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#whats-your-learning-style"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What's Your Learning Style?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, the question is: what's the best learning style for you? Of course, there's no one-size-fits-all answer, you'll have to find the answer for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best way to find out is to try both approaches, and check which method helped you learn better.&lt;/strong&gt; Or if you're already trying to learn things and you're facing too many challenges, try the opposite approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only caveat here is: some top-down learners might put off learning the fundamentals, even after they became proficient with the framework. I strongly recommend that you &lt;strong&gt;don't put off learning the fundamentals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning the basics helps you a lot when you have to find and fix bugs in your code. No matter if you learn them before or after, what counts is that you do know them.&lt;/p&gt;
