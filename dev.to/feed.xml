      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article, we will focus on Decentralized exchange software, trying to compare decentralized exchanges vs centralized exchange and make things easier for you to understand the differences.&lt;br&gt;
But first, let’s start with the Types of Cryptocurrency Exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#types-of-cryptocurrency-exchanges"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Types of Cryptocurrency Exchanges
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Centralized exchanges.&lt;br&gt;
• Decentralized exchanges.&lt;br&gt;
• Hybrid cryptocurrency exchanges&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#centralized-exchanges"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Centralized Exchanges
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s put it this way, centralized means that there’s a single point that does all the work involved in any given operation. Their platform needs all the data to enter and leave through a central. This means you can’t send or receive any information without it going through a single point.&lt;br&gt;
Centralized exchange are most known and traditional in the crypto sphere. They are governed by a company that offers the options of both crypto-to-crypto trading and fiat-to-crypto gateway. CEX is a place, where buyers meet sellers on some centralized platform, meaning that someone handles your crypto and is responsible for it. You can use the order books for your trades and in some advanced exchanges even some technical analysis tools.&lt;br&gt;
The biggest advantages are that Centralized exchange is easy to use and has great UI and UX, which go along with the quick response. In some of them, you simply register with your email, write down your password, and you can trade.&lt;br&gt;
Customer support, various trading pairs, and fiat gateways are often offered by Centralized exchanges, and most of the time you can benefit from additional services such as staking, savings opportunities, or IEOs (Initial exchange offers). They also add services known as DeFi. Some of you might ask, what is DeFi in crypto, or what is decentralized finance? In a simple way, those are decentralized instruments that you might know from the banking sector such as lending or borrowing of crypto, but without a middleman.&lt;br&gt;
The most popular centralized exchanges are Binance, Coinbase, and Huobi.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--C6Z1h8Pl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nr7e4gl4e4ldk4s7kesp.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--C6Z1h8Pl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nr7e4gl4e4ldk4s7kesp.png" alt="Decentralized Exchanges" width="880" height="440"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#decentralized-exchanges"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Decentralized Exchanges
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decentralized exchange is a cryptocurrency exchange that operates in a decentralized way, without a central authority, without relying on a third-party service to hold the customer's funds. Instead, trades occur directly between users (p2p) through an automated process. This system can be achieved by creating proxy tokens (crypto assets that represent a certain fiat or cryptocurrency) or assets (that can represent shares in a company, for example) or through a decentralized multi-signature escrow system, among other solutions that are currently being developed.&lt;br&gt;
Because the most advanced blockchain with the largest number of tokens (ERC-20 tokens) is Ethereum, most Decentralized exchanges operate using Ethereum and its smart contracts, most of them can't even handle Bitcoin for trading. This might be upgraded by arriving at decentralized finances (DeFi) on an interoperable platform. With their usage, the limits for trading will be much lower.&lt;br&gt;
Because no company is responsible for the run of DEX, it's harder for governments and regulators to shut them down. But the price for decentralization is on most Decentralized exchanges low trading volume, small liquidity, lower speed, and poorer UI which makes them harder to use.&lt;br&gt;
Some Decentralized exchanges are focused merely on experienced users. You can’t contact customer support for help on DEX, and they don’t provide a fiat gateway as CEX does.&lt;br&gt;
The most known decentralized exchanges are Binance DEX and Uniswap. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#hybrid-cryptocurrency-exchanges"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Hybrid Cryptocurrency Exchanges
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is a hybrid cryptocurrency exchange? Simply, it’s the kind that is taking advantage of each Centralized exchange and Decentralized exchange. It is the combination of fast transaction speed you can find in centralized platforms and security assurance by still holding private keys. Hybrid types are a new generation of the crypto trading marketplace, but still underdevelopment. The most popular hybrid types are Nash exchange and Qurrex exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IUvtQlJQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b4k7106sx8yw9adazpe0.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IUvtQlJQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b4k7106sx8yw9adazpe0.png" alt="Decentralized Exchanges Vs Centralized Exchanges" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#decentralized-exchangesdex-vs-centralized-exchangescex"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Decentralized Exchanges(DEX) Vs Centralized Exchanges(CEX)
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s compare the centralized and decentralized exchanges, as the result will be individual for each one of you. For better understanding, we used the comparison table.&lt;br&gt;
It’s up to you to decide, which type of cryptocurrency exchange will solve the best for your needs. If you are going to purchase your crypto with fiat, you will need to use CEX or HEX. The same thing is when you desire to trade many kinds of different altcoins because DEX is mostly limited to ERC-20 tokens or some limited number of cryptocurrencies.&lt;br&gt;
Traders who want to handle their taxes and statistics about all trades can use some centralized exchanges that can easily help with that.&lt;br&gt;
Decentralized exchanges and hybrid exchanges are rather focused on more experienced users, who use solely their hardware wallets and want to have every Satoshi under their full control. But they sacrifice some other qualities provided by centralized exchanges. User experience, high trading volume and liquidity, as well as additional services like Initial Exchange Offerings (IEO), DeFi products, and so on.&lt;br&gt;
In conclusion, if you choose some prestigious and well-secured Centralized, you can even earn more crypto by using their features such as staking or lending so your crypto actually works for you even when you sleep – and that counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#some-of-the-best-decentralized-exchange"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Some of the Best Decentralized Exchange
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the early days of Bitcoin, exchanges have played an important role in mediating between buyers and sellers of cryptocurrencies. Traditionally, centralized exchanges have been dominated in this area. However, with the rapidly evolving stack of available technology, more and more tools for decentralized trading have become available. For example:&lt;br&gt;
• &lt;strong&gt;Uniswap:&lt;/strong&gt; Uniswap is a kind of decentralized exchange or, in short, DEX that is on the ascent. The Uniswap platform has been in existence since 2018, working on the Ethereum blockchain. It is the second-biggest cryptocurrency program in terms of market capitalization globally, making it viable with all ERC-20 tokens and frameworks, for example, wallet services.&lt;br&gt;
• &lt;strong&gt;PancakeSwap:&lt;/strong&gt; PancakeSwap is a decentralized exchange that is similar to Ethereum’s Uniswap, but it runs on Binance Smart Chain instead. The DEX lets you swap tokens without an intermediary, as well as earn liquidity pool and staking rewards, enter a lottery, and other options.&lt;br&gt;
• &lt;strong&gt;Binance DEX:&lt;/strong&gt; Binance DEX is a decentralized exchange created by Binance and powered by the company’s Binance Coin (BNB). It offers lower fees and improved security over centralized exchanges. However, it also has a steeper learning curve and is best suited to experienced crypto users.&lt;br&gt;
• &lt;strong&gt;IDEX BSC:&lt;/strong&gt; IDEX, a high-performance decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX), today announced the launch of IDEX's trading infrastructure on Binance Smart Chain to provide efficient, cost-effective DEX trading.&lt;br&gt;
• &lt;strong&gt;Sushiswap:&lt;/strong&gt; SushiSwap is a popular Ethereum-based decentralized exchange (DEX) that allows users to swap tokens, earn rewards via yield farming, and more.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CYnZPiih--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0mhub9i25f5zzwaza4x7.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CYnZPiih--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0mhub9i25f5zzwaza4x7.png" alt="How Decentralized Exchanges Do Work" width="880" height="587"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-decentralized-exchanges-do-work"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How Decentralized Exchanges Do Work?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On some decentralized exchanges, everything happens on a blockchain, every order is recorded on the blockchain. This approach is considered the most transparent because users don't trust any third party to transmit the orders, and therefore they cannot be distorted in any way. This approach is also the most impractical. Because users are asking all the nodes in the network to permanently record their orders, they are paying a fee for doing so. Also, they have to wait for the miner to add their transaction to the blockchain, which also creates an inconvenience. Like digital currencies, decentralized exchanges were created in response to flawed and archaic financial systems that passed along risks of a centralized system to its users, including insufficient security, technical issues, and a lack of transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-can-i-do-with-decentralized-exchange"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What Can I Do with Decentralized Exchange?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can make a new online marketplace for exchanging any digital crypto assets in a decentralized manner without having to spend dozens of thousands on development, asset security, and staff.&lt;br&gt;
• Send and receive any existing cryptocurrencies.&lt;br&gt;
• Issue and manage new tokens to digitalize assets - create, mint/burn, and freeze/unfreeze.&lt;br&gt;
• Create trading pairs between different tokens.&lt;br&gt;
• Send orders to buy and sell crypto assets through created trading pairs.&lt;br&gt;
• Watch the market charts to monitor prices and market activity for other market pairs, powered by Trading View, or any other trading chart API.&lt;br&gt;
• Explore the transaction history and blocks on the chain via different interfaces.&lt;br&gt;
• Run a full node to listen and broadcast chain transactions, blocks, and consensus.&lt;br&gt;
• Develop more tools and libraries to improve and enhance Open DEX.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MdbFs5y2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wzy9uhtg5m4dmrt0f3ti.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MdbFs5y2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wzy9uhtg5m4dmrt0f3ti.png" alt="Different Types of Decentralized Exchanges" width="880" height="528"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Different Types of Decentralized Exchanges
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;On-Chain Order Books:&lt;/strong&gt; For some decentralized exchanges, everything is processed on-chain, including modifying and canceling orders. Philosophically, this is the most decentralized and transparent process because it circumvents trusting a third party to handle any orders at any time. However, this approach is not very practical in execution.&lt;br&gt;
• &lt;strong&gt;Off-Chain Order Books:&lt;/strong&gt; DEXs with off-chain order books are still decentralized to some degree but are somewhat more centralized than their on-chain counterparts. As opposed to orders being stored on the blockchain, off-chain orders are posted elsewhere, such as a centralized entity that governs the order book. Such an entity could exploit access to the order books to front-run or misrepresent orders, however, users’ funds would still be protected from the DEXs noncustodial model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#advantages-of-decentralized-cryptocurrency-exchanges"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Advantages of Decentralized Cryptocurrency Exchanges
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• The ease of access: CEX makes it easier for users to create an account or buy their first cryptocurrency. This helped to bring new users into the system and has also made crypto markets more popular.&lt;br&gt;
• They have a license: Most of these centralized exchanges have licenses and runs under government regulations. This gives the trader an assurance if something goes wrong.&lt;br&gt;
• Use of escrow: As a middleman in trades, they hold the currency until both parties complete their end of the bargain. Thus, there’s no need to worry about the transaction after the trade gets finalized.&lt;br&gt;
• Transparency: They make their address and location available to the traders. Hence, it helps the consumers to reach them if needed.&lt;br&gt;
• Offers and discounts: CEX also offer discounts while trading in large amounts. Also, the users can exchange fiat currencies to crypto and cryptocurrencies to fiat.&lt;br&gt;
• Privacy: Transactions made on DEX shares no data with the third party. Hence, it allows maintaining consumer’s information and privacy. Also, centralized exchanges ask for personal information such as email, identity proof, and phone number while signing up. DEX doesn’t need any of that.&lt;br&gt;
• Security: The biggest advantage of decentralization is the enhanced security it offers. The cryptocurrency got introduced for this purpose, it gives the consumer complete control over their assets.&lt;br&gt;
• Decentralized servers: Most DEXs do not have a centralized server, they store data across various servers around the world. Hence, the data remains safe and is almost impossible to get hacked.&lt;br&gt;
• Funds are held by you in your personal wallet and not by a third party&lt;br&gt;
• Users are not required to disclose their personal details (except if the exchange method involves bank transfers, in this case only the buyer or seller from which you will buy\sell will only know your details)&lt;br&gt;
• No Hacker activity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#disadvantages-of-decentralized-exchange"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Disadvantages of Decentralized Exchange
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Users are at a loss if they are ever hacked for their passwords or private keys.&lt;br&gt;
• Low Liquidity&lt;br&gt;
• Only Basic features for Trade available&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8qbvhu2y--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/itya8bn4cxbc4bs9tfm6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8qbvhu2y--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/itya8bn4cxbc4bs9tfm6.png" alt="What is Decentralized Exchange Software" width="880" height="324"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-decentralized-exchange-software"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Decentralized Exchange Software?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the world of digitalization, online transactions, and the utilization of virtual currency are gradually increasing day by day. Since the origination of the world’s first virtual currency, i.e., Bitcoin in the year 2009, most of the countries are choosing virtual currency over real currency for making their financial transactions. A secured and bug-free exchange development is much needed for the virtual transactions to stop the fraudulent activities across the globe.&lt;br&gt;
The bitcoin exchange websites are completely based on decentralized servers that are spread around the world. It is also not restricted to one particular location, which becomes a drawback for hackers. Also, the platforms offer the ownership of cryptocurrency in the user’s hands just by serving as the bridge between the traders. For this reason, the use of decentralized exchange software is needed to launch your own crypto exchange. So you can get this product from cryptocurrency exchange website development companies.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fRnViZ5q--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ne89t0t743eqoc1kkybf.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fRnViZ5q--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ne89t0t743eqoc1kkybf.png" alt="How to Create a Software for a Decentralized Cryptocurrency Exchange?" width="880" height="413"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-create-a-software-for-a-decentralized-cryptocurrency-exchange"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to Create a Software for a Decentralized Cryptocurrency Exchange?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choosing A Development Company: If there is a desire to create an exchanger that will maximally meet the requirements stated by the customer, then the best solution would be to develop software with the help of an outsourced company. The result will be a unique solution, the quality of which will be guaranteed by the contractor.&lt;br&gt;
Ready software: There is nothing easier and at the same time more convenient than an out-of-the-box solution, which is quite simple to choose and buy. Subsequently, the development company independently carries out installation, configuration and testing. An even easier way is to buy a ready-made site and rebrand it (renaming).&lt;br&gt;
White label solutions: A white label solution is a product or service that is produced by one company and that other companies rebrand to make it appear as if they made it. Another way to think of a white label solution is you are renting software from the owner and passing it off as your own. Over the last few years, white label solutions have grown in popularity as businesses are reluctant to invest in developing their own technology and infrastructure. This has created a need for specialist companies to develop technology platforms that can easily be rebranded and presented to the end client under a variety of brand identities. A cryptocurrency exchange on a standard basis, as a rule, becomes either a temporary alternative or an additional service for customers. The main activity of a buyer of such a product is not related to cryptocurrency, but the topic is quite similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#last-word"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Last Word
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the text above, It’s up to the individual to choose the right exchange for themselves. Centralized exchange, provides ease of access and reliability, while decentralized exchange contributes to enhanced privacy. Both have their own benefits and concerns. But if you choose a decentralized exchange, then you should get the decentralized exchange software from the best cryptocurrency exchange development companies. They take care of everything from development, design, testing, and deployment, allowing you to focus on just the customization part. There are many advantages involved with purchasing and deploying a decentralized exchange software for your business.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="#about-uniswap-exchange"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  About Uniswap Exchange
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uniswap is a DeFi project that gives the possibility to exchange or give liquidity in crypto or fiat currencies. Uniswap currently does not have a native token, meaning liquidity providers earn the fees dominated in the assets within their respective market.&lt;br&gt;
It uniswap be thought of as a set of computer programs running on the blockchain of Ethereum that allow the execution of swap token type decentralized. &lt;br&gt;
Traders are able to trade Ethereum tokens on Uniswap directly, without intercessions. In addition, it is possible to lend your cryptocurrencies to special reserves called liquidity pools, obtaining commissions in exchange. A kind of loan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#stable-coins"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Stable Coins:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Tether: USDT&lt;br&gt;
• True USD: TUSD&lt;br&gt;
• Dai Stablecoin: DAI&lt;br&gt;
• Paxos Standard: PAX&lt;br&gt;
• USD Coin: USDC&lt;br&gt;

  What Is Uniswap Used for?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, Uniswap exchange is used for exchanging crypto values. It is managed by an Ethereum blockchain, so it allows all sorts of tokens. Besides, the protocol is also used for yield farming where a user can invest in a liquidity pool. People can use different strategies to earn profits and increase passive crypto earning.&lt;br&gt;
Before we saw what Uniswap clone script is, now let's see what are advantages of using clone script?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Advantages of using a Website Clone Script for Businesses
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Time: The biggest benefit of a cloning solution is that you will be able to save a lot of time for yourself. With the assistance of cloning, you will be able to save time by not going into a complete development cycle.&lt;br&gt;
• Expense: When it comes to developing a website, you will need a good amount of money and resources to get the development covered with perfection. But, thanks to cloning scripts, you will be able to overcome this hurdle as well.&lt;br&gt;
• Strategizing: Before moving towards the development zone, it is important that we plan our work and then take it ahead. We require strategizing about the stuff that will keep the users and viewers engaged for a long on the website. Everything requires proper planning before it is taken ahead. &lt;br&gt;
• Coding Knowledge: We all have a promising idea of a startup but, we fail to make an impact and all because of not having proper knowledge of online marketing and programming language. &lt;br&gt;
• Competition: The competition is quite high, and it is quite difficult for startups to make an impact straight away. But, with the assistance of web clone scripts things are quite possible, you will be able to have a space for your business in the competitive market as well.&lt;br&gt;

  Why to Create a Mobile Application Like Uniswap App?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trading cryptocurrencies with mobile apps becomes a usual activity of traders nowadays. So, every popular cryptocurrencies exchange provides a separate mobile app for its traders to keep on engaging with them. So, as an entrepreneur, when you draft a business plan to start an exchange like uniswap, you must have added this one too. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#which-exchange-is-better-uniswap-or-idex"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Which exchange is better? Uniswap or Idex?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#idex"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Idex:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IDEX is available on Binance, Uniswap V2, Gate.io and Balancer.&lt;br&gt;

Volume / Market Cap: 0.1929&lt;br&gt;
Market Rank: 388&lt;br&gt;
Circulating Supply: 592,220,290.83 IDEX&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advantages of Idex: &lt;br&gt;

Uniswap has quickly become the de facto exchange for DeFi tokens to be traded.&lt;br&gt;
 Compared to its more recent competitors, it still maintains the largest market share, the best liquidity, and the widest range of tokens available for trading. If one thing is for certain, the fact that Uniswap was able to build such an intuitive product with $100k seriously challenges the notions of how much funding is necessary to build a true killer application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion!
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In today’s fast-changing world of technology and digital money, IDEX Exchange is among the safest options to trade without having to give any deposit or withdrawal money. It is highly secure and cost-effective for users looking to earn more on their funds by trading and staking cryptocurrencies. But with that being said, it should be emphasized that only Ethereum-based assets are currently supported in the current version. While it is possible to wrap cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (WBTC) and trade it via Uniswap, at this point in time other protocols are not supported via Uniswap markets. Also, it can be said compared to its, Uniswap is the best for low fees.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today i learned how to limit the maximum width of the text in the div below by using max-width it stops the text from stretching all the way, i also made top div's width 100% so background color can be show all the way. The div's with class name .intro-content made it easier to center using margin auto. &lt;br&gt;

      <title>Becoming a Self Mentor</title>
      <author>Clever coder</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 04:37:28 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/yusuf_software/becoming-a-self-mentor-1pk0</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/yusuf_software/becoming-a-self-mentor-1pk0</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I’ve often found myself wishing for a mentor much more often than I’ve actually had one. When I first got started in Tech, I again felt like I needed a mentor, but being remote and mostly autonomous, I had no idea where to find one. Instead of throwing my hands up and hoping for the best, I decided to break down why I was feeling that way and think of creative ways to get similar results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me share with you what I’ve learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why We Want a Mentor&lt;br&gt;
Why is it that we want a mentor? What’s the outcome we’re looking for? For me, it’s usually some combination of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel directionless.&lt;br&gt;
I don’t know if I’m learning the right thing.&lt;br&gt;
I don’t know whether the code I’m writing or the work I’m doing is good.&lt;br&gt;
I can’t seem to finish anything.&lt;br&gt;
I’m just down in the dumps.&lt;br&gt;
On top of that, I’m also feeling so overwhelmed that I don’t want to dig in and do the work required to research these answers myself. In short, I’m looking for a silver bullet in human form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is that you, too? Often we’re looking for some mythical senior developer or lead architect somewhere to tell us the one thing we need to learn or build that’s going to rocket us to a FAANG job (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google), a more senior position, or Twitch stardom. Those things don’t happen in one fell swoop, though. They happen over years of focused effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, on a deeper level, what are we looking for when we want a mentor? We generally want:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Direction: We want someone to break down for us what to learn and what not to worry about yet.&lt;br&gt;
Quality Control: We want someone to check our code or content quality to make sure it’s right. As we get a little more advanced, we also want someone to let us know if what we’re doing is a “best practice.”&lt;br&gt;
Accountability: We want someone to check in on us and keep us from falling off the wagon of working towards our goals.&lt;br&gt;
Encouragement: We all want a cheerleader for when we’re running low on motivation. Nothing wrong with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a way we can achieve those same results without having one single mentor carrying the burden?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to Self-Mentor&lt;br&gt;
To self-mentor, we basically need find suitable replacements in all four areas. Here are some things that have been helping me in each of those areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Direction&lt;br&gt;
Figuring out the direction you want to go, and whether it’s the right one, is a little bit of art and a little bit of science. There are a few different sources for this you can use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a development job and a boss, that’s going to set a lot of your direction. We often don’t feel like this is valid because the day job rarely feels cool or exciting enough to feel like we’re making progress. Truthfully, you are making more progress just by racking up experience points. Don’t worry that it’s not in Hip Framework X — the beauty of programming is that experience transfers between technologies.&lt;br&gt;
Seeing what’s trending in both the job market and what people are talking about is another good indicator of a direction you could go. Be wary of chasing every new technology that pops up on Twitter. It’s better to go a little broad at first as you build up experience. A lot of the coolest technologies disappear in a year.&lt;br&gt;
What are people you admire and respect doing? I have a handful of people I follow as “trendsetters” because I trust their judgment. They’re not jumping around between flash-in-the-pan technologies, so I can tell when something is worth my attention.&lt;br&gt;
Here’s another one people overlook: money. If someone is willing to pay you to code in or teach a technology, that’s a good sign you’re doing something right. Money as a direction indicator can come from freelance work, a full time job, or a product like a book or video course. Interestingly, what will bring you money is not always what is trending on Twitter.&lt;br&gt;
Quality Control&lt;br&gt;
This is probably the trickiest of the group because tech is always changing. You’ll need to “triangulate” a few different sources as you work through this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of coding tutorial websites like AlgoExpert and Execute Program have built-in IDEs that run tests and check your work. This is very helpful for just knowing if your code runs and is syntactically correct.&lt;br&gt;
While conference talks are great for ecosystem news, they can also help you identify patterns and best practices that industry leaders are using.&lt;br&gt;
Courses, articles, and training from high-quality sources can also show you patterns and best practices.&lt;br&gt;
Never underestimate the value of the docs. Docs are meant to not only teach you the nuts and bolts of a technology, but also the best practices.&lt;br&gt;
Accountability&lt;br&gt;
Here are four different places you can find accountability:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individual accountability: find a friend and commit to each other to do something. Start with short, small commitments (e.g. a small project in a week). It’s like a gym buddy, but for code. An excellent medium for this is Twitch. Live stream building a project together!&lt;br&gt;
Learning in public: Writing out what you’re learning about doubles as a means of accountability. This is even more true if you commit to a regular cadence. Pro tip on that: give yourself an end goal. For example, “Write lessons I learned studying PHP every Friday for four weeks” instead of “Write every week about PHP lessons.” You’re much more likely to stick something with a hard stop. You can always start another round!&lt;br&gt;
Group challenges/learning cohorts: There are various groups challenges that you can get involved with. For example, hashtags like #100DaysOfCode and study groups for things like JavaScript30. There are also groups cropping up as “learning cohorts,” which are kind of like book clubs for coding.&lt;br&gt;
Paying a consultant: This isn’t always an option, but sometimes the shortest path between two points is to just pay someone to help. A few years ago I hurt my back. I had to do a bunch of tedious exercises to get better. Do you think I’d have done them if I wasn’t paying a physical therapist to pester me? Heck no! You can often just offer to pay someone for an hour of their time to pair up with you on something. It might feel expensive, but it also might save you tens or hundreds of hours.&lt;br&gt;
Summary of all is you need:&lt;br&gt;
DIRECTION&lt;br&gt;
QUALITY CONTROL AND &lt;br&gt;
ACCOUNTABILITY.&lt;br&gt;
Hope this piece help and hope to see you as an expert sometimes.&lt;br&gt;
Yusuf&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can catch me on social media at &lt;br&gt;
Twitter: yusuf_software&lt;br&gt;
GitHub:&lt;a href="https://github.com/yusuf-saif"&gt;https://github.com/yusuf-saif&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
LinkedIn:&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yusuf-saifur-rahman-939533192"&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/in/yusuf-saifur-rahman-939533192&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do have a nice learning process 🙂.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, remember: deadlines and dollars get stuff done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encouragement&lt;br&gt;
Don’t neglect this part of the process. We all need support! Sometimes we just need someone to let us know we’re doing alright. Heck, I know I do. We’re also notoriously bad at “feeling” our own progress. Here are some ideas on where to go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discord servers. I’ve been so happy to be part of different Discord groups. One that has been particularly welcoming is called Code Cafe Online. A lot of Discord servers also have a “celebrating wins” channel, which is a great idea.&lt;br&gt;
Twitter friends. Sometimes you just need people on the internet to cheer you on.&lt;br&gt;
Slack servers. Some coding groups, meetups, and bootcamps have dedicated Slack servers that can be a great motivation boost.&lt;br&gt;
My email list. Really, feel free to write me whenever you need a boost! It may take me a bit to respond, but I will do my best to send you a note of encouragement.&lt;br&gt;
Your Task for this Week&lt;br&gt;
Use the framework I’ve laid out above to build yourself a system to learn and improve. This unlocks basically an endless list of mentors by proxy. Rather than seeking out the One True Mentor, figure out who you want to be like and observe them. What are they doing well? What is driving their success? You can have endless mentors if you know what to look for and how to harness those observations into action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just remember one thing: building a system like this doesn’t happen overnight. Take it one step at a time. This week, first pick the area that you feel like are feeling the most pain. Are you feeling lost? Are you frustrated by your code quality? Are you never able to finish projects? Are you feeling down and ready to give up? Work on these one at a time and don’t get discouraged if the first attempt doesn’t work. Keep at it. Remember: it’s not a failure, it’s a test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve picked your biggest pain point, write me back and let me know your plan to use one of the strategies in this framework to help make it a little bit better.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A JavaScript Utility for Measuring Spacing</title>
      <author>Steven Lei</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 04:05:49 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/stevenlei/a-javascript-utility-for-measuring-spacing-4ne3</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/stevenlei/a-javascript-utility-for-measuring-spacing-4ne3</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, I am Steven. I just wrote a JavaScript utility named &lt;strong&gt;SpacingJS&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a frontend web developer, it is important to grasp the spacing between elements on a webpage. The DevTool can check the dimension, padding, margin, styles and more of an element, but it seems like it cannot measure the distance between elements like Sketch/Figma. So I have written this utility:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xS3JfR_W--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/afv2u3wqrkwlvi3vrr7n.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xS3JfR_W--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/afv2u3wqrkwlvi3vrr7n.png" alt="SpacingJS" width="880" height="794"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can experience on the website:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://spacingjs.com"&gt;https://spacingjs.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides including the script with a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag to your website, a Chrome Extension is available on the &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/spacingjs/fhjegjndanjcamfldhenjnhnjheecgcc"&gt;Chrome Web Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project is open-source and available here: &lt;a href="https://github.com/stevenlei/spacingjs"&gt;https://github.com/stevenlei/spacingjs&lt;/a&gt;. Would you please star it if you like it?:)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Scaffolding Static Web Apps</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/azure/scaffolding-static-web-apps-4p97</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XkT9fWUR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.aaron-powell.com/images/2021-11-16-scaffolding-static-web-apps/a-lot-of-swa.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XkT9fWUR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.aaron-powell.com/images/2021-11-16-scaffolding-static-web-apps/a-lot-of-swa.png" alt="Jesus that’s a lot of Static Web Apps (meme)" width="640" height="631"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Modified version of &lt;a href="https://jakelikesonions.com/post/158707858999/the-future-more-of-the-present"&gt;this comic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past 18 months I’ve created a lot of &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/?WT.mc_id=javascript-47883-aapowell"&gt;Azure Static Web Apps&lt;/a&gt;, like… a lot. I’ve hit the quota of free apps several times and had to clean out demos to keep testing things!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s always a little bit tedious, running &lt;code&gt;create-react-app&lt;/code&gt;, setting up Functions, etc. so I went about creating a GitHub repo template for a &lt;a href="https://github.com/aaronpowell/aswa-react-template"&gt;basic React + TypeScript + Functions app&lt;/a&gt;. Then sometimes I’d be wanting a different framework, so I’d go off hunting for a new template, rinse and repeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#enter-raw-createswaapp-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Enter &lt;code&gt;create-swa-app&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lLe-acFJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://www.aaron-powell.com/images/2021-11-16-scaffolding-static-web-apps/terminal.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lLe-acFJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://www.aaron-powell.com/images/2021-11-16-scaffolding-static-web-apps/terminal.gif" alt="create-swa-app demo" width="880" height="641"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To tackle this, I decided to create a command line tool to be used with &lt;code&gt;npm init&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/aaronpowell/create-swa-app"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@aaronpowell/swa-app&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which will guide you through the creation using one of the templates that is listed on &lt;a href="https://github.com/staticwebdev/awesome-azure-static-web-apps#starter-kits"&gt;&lt;code&gt;awesome-static-web-apps&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It will also offer to create a GitHub repo for you using the template (this will prompt for a GitHub sign in workflow), so you’ll be ready to deploy it to Azure!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of this as a helpful starting point before jumping into the &lt;a href="https://github.com/Azure/static-web-apps-cli"&gt;SWA CLI&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurestaticwebapps&amp;amp;WT.mc_id=javascript-47883-aapowell"&gt;VS Code extension&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you’ll find this as a useful way to scaffold up a Static Web Apps project!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intro to React useEffect Hook </title>
      <author>Carlo Gino Catapang</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 01:01:17 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/codegino/react-useeffect-hook-1bg</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/codegino/react-useeffect-hook-1bg</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#an-introduction-on-how-to-use-useeffect-hook-in-a-react-application"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://carlogino.cc/blog/react-useeffect"&gt;An introduction on how to use useEffect Hook in a React application&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-a-raw-useeffect-endraw-hook"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is a &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; Hook?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tldr"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  TLDR
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; is an alternative to the "old" &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; lifecycle methods/hooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be used to manage side effects, such as network requests, or to run a piece of code when the component is mounted, updated, or unmounted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#longer-version"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Longer version
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to &lt;code&gt;React v16.8&lt;/code&gt;, we can only enable a component&lt;br&gt;
to react to state changes using &lt;a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#adding-lifecycle-methods-to-a-class"&gt;lifecycle methods&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-define-a-raw-useeffect-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to define a &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//(1) declaration&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// (2)effect&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// (3)cleanup &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* (4)dependency array */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#heres-an-explanation-of-the-above-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Here's an explanation of the above code:
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can declare an effect by calling either &lt;code&gt;React.useEffect&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;effect&lt;/code&gt; is the function that will be called when the component is mounted
OR when the dependency array changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;cleanup&lt;/code&gt; is the function that will be called when the effect "unmounted".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;dependency array&lt;/code&gt; is the array of values that will be passed to the &lt;code&gt;effect&lt;/code&gt; function.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there is no dependency array, the effect will be called every time the component is mounted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the array is empty, the effect will be called only once when the component is mounted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the array is not empty, the effect will be called every time the component is mounted and the dependency array changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#examples"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Examples
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#increment-a-counter-every-second-until-it-reaches-10"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Increment a counter every second until it reaches 10
&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;interval&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;prev&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;prev&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// cleanup function&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;clearInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;interval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Render the component&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Ignore old keys for now&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Render the component&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#or-just-mimic-a-class-lifecycle-method"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  OR just mimic a class lifecycle method
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check this &lt;a href="https://dev.to/carlogino/react-class-life-cycle-methods-to-useeffect-1kg0"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; on how to convert a class lifecycle methods to &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; hooks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#additional-note"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Additional Note
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; can only be used in functional components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The order of &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; declarations are important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; in a custom hook is a great way to promote side effect reusability. I will discuss this in another blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to the old lifecycle methods, &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; is much more powerful and flexible which makes it an ideal choice when managing a side-effect.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ใช้คำสั่ง docker บน Ubuntu โดยไม่ต้องใช้ sudo</title>
      <author>Weerasak Chongnguluam</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 00:56:26 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/iporsut/aichkhamsang-docker-bn-ubuntu-odyaimtngaich-sudo-3f1h</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/iporsut/aichkhamsang-docker-bn-ubuntu-odyaimtngaich-sudo-3f1h</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;หลังจากลง Docker บน Ubuntu แล้วนั่นเราจะใช้งานมันได้เราต้องใช้สิทธิ์ root ซึ่งต้องสั่ง docker โดยใช้ sudo เช่น &lt;code&gt;sudo docker ps&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;แต่ถ้าเราอยากสั่งโดยไม่ต้องใช้ sudo ก็สามารถทำได้โดยเพิ่ม user ของเราเข้าไปใช้ usergroup ที่ชื่อว่า &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; ด้วยคำสั่งแบบนี้&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;หลังจากนั้น logout แล้ว login อีกที (ถ้าไม่ได้ก็จัดการ restart OS อีกรอบ) เราก็สามารถสั่งคำสั่ง &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; ด้วย user เราเองโดยไม่ต้องใช้สิทธิ์ root ผ่าน sudo อีกแล้ว เช่น&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run hello-world
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Beginning of 100 Days of Code</title>
      <author>Josh Smith</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 00:39:49 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/joshdevhub/beginning-of-100-days-of-code-1aid</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/joshdevhub/beginning-of-100-days-of-code-1aid</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-beginning"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Beginning
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I am beginning the &lt;a href="https://www.100daysofcode.com/"&gt;100 Days of Code Challenge&lt;/a&gt;. This challenge only asks that you code for one hour a day, every day, for 100 days. I've been mostly sticking to this for a couple months anyway, but I want to officially commit to it as a way to force myself to keep on track and log my progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of logging my progress, I think I'll make posts here every 10 days detailing what I've been up to and what I've learned. I'm in the midst of the Ruby Path at &lt;a href="https://theodinproject.com"&gt;The Odin Project&lt;/a&gt;, an open source curriculum for learning Web Development. I expect most of my stuff will be using Ruby and maybe towards the end, Rails specifically. Lately I've been working on building a game of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)"&gt;Mastermind&lt;/a&gt;, which is easily the most complicated thing I've had to build so far in my journey with programming. Hopefully, I'll be able to show off a finished product in time for the 10 Day Update 🤞 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#some-rules"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Some Rules
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this challenge will move through the holiday season, I will give myself a one week break while I'm visiting my family back home. But other than that, I plan to keep on schedule barring some intense illness or emergency. Looking forward to expanding my skills and getting on a new career path 💯&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://carlogino.cc/blog/lifecycle-methods-to-useeffect"&gt;How to map a React class life cycle methods/hooks to useEffect&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#common-class-lifecycle-methods"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Common class lifecycle methods
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// happens as soon as your component is mounted&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;componentDidMount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// happens as soon as the updating begin&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;componentDidUpdate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;prevProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;prevState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;snapshot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// for certain performance optimizations&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shouldComponentUpdate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nextProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nextState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// happens just before the component unmounts&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;componentWillUnmount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-can-we-map-those-lifecycle-hooks-to-useeffect"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How can we map those lifecycle hooks to useEffect?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are basic templates to convert a class lifecycle method to a useEffect hook:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#componentdidmount"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  componentDidMount
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create an empty dependency array and pass it to the &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; hook.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// code to run when the component is mounted &lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Make sure this is empty to ensure hook will only run once&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://codepen.io/codegino/pen/qBXKWxx"&gt;Link to Codepen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#shouldcomponentupdate"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  shouldComponentUpdate
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the dependency array and pass it to the &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; hook.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// props: {name}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// state: {visible}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ... code to run&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// the dependency array below is "equivalent" to:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// the effect will trigger if&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// props.name !== nextProps.name || state.enabled !== nextState.enabled&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;visible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://codepen.io/codegino/pen/gOxKObO"&gt;Link to Codepen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#componentwillunmount"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  componentWillUnmount
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; can return a function which its body will be executed when the component is unmounted.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// code to run when the component is unmounted&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* with or without dependency array */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://codepen.io/codegino/pen/vYJrBKr"&gt;Link to Codepen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#componentdidupdate"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  componentDidUpdate
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a bit subjective because it's up to the developer to decide how &lt;code&gt;componentDidUpdate&lt;/code&gt; should behave (the simplest is the same as &lt;code&gt;componentDidMount&lt;/code&gt; mapping).&lt;br&gt;
It could also be a combination of &lt;code&gt;componentDidMount&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;shouldComponentUpdate&lt;/code&gt; mapping with the addition&lt;br&gt;
of a reference variable to check if the component has been mounted as shown below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hasMount&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hasMount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// code to run when the component is updated&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hasMount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* dependencies */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

  Additional Note
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can only define one of each lifecycle method in a &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; component.
When using hooks you can define as many &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; as you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can only use &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; in a &lt;code&gt;function&lt;/code&gt; component&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The examples above are simple ways to map a &lt;code&gt;class lifecycle hooks&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
component to a &lt;code&gt;React hooks&lt;/code&gt;, and there are many other ways to do it.&lt;br&gt;
The good news is that you don't need to think of mapping lifecycle hooks to useEffect since React hooks introduced a&lt;br&gt;
different paradigm on how we can create a React component and how we can mange side-effects.&lt;br&gt;
This mapping is only useful when I'm refactoring a &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; component to be a &lt;code&gt;function&lt;/code&gt; component.&lt;br&gt;
For newer projects, I ought to think that class component does not exists.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Making the most of our startup’s on-call rotation</title>

&lt;p&gt;Will I have to be on call?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last hour of &lt;a href="https://koan.co/"&gt;Koan&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.koan.co/blog/why-we-open-sourced-our-hiring-manual"&gt;on-site interview&lt;/a&gt; we turn the tables and invite candidates to interview our hiring team. At face value it’s a chance to answer any open questions we haven’t answered earlier in the process. It’s also a subtle way to introspect on our own hiring process — after three rounds of interviews and side-channel conversations with the hiring manager, what have we missed? What’s on candidates’ minds? Can we address it earlier in the process?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you asked, will I have to be on call?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The middle of the night pager rings? The panicked investigations? Remediation, write-ups, post-mortems?&lt;br&gt;
We get it. We’ve been there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/patrickc"&gt;Patrick Collison&lt;/a&gt;’s been there, too:&lt;/p&gt;

      Stripe, 2011. I decided to assign a custom ringtone to PagerDuty. Chose the iPhone's duck sound. Many (many) problems and pages followed. Years later, walking through park, I heard a soft quack. Shivered involuntarily, pulse quickened.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And that's how I ruined ducks for myself.

&lt;p&gt;“Don’t ruin the duck.” There are worse guiding principles for an on-call process (and operational health generally).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, will I have to be on call?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, you will. But we’ve gotten a ton out of Koan’s on-call rotation and we hope you will, too. Ready to learn more?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#oncall-at-koan"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  On-call at Koan
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set up Koan’s on-call rotation before we’d heard anything about Patrick’s ducks. Our version of “don’t ruin the duck,” included three principles that (if somewhat less evocative) have held up surprisingly well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;We concentrate distractions&lt;/strong&gt; — our on-call developer is tasked with minimizing context switching for the rest of the team. We’ll escalate incidents if needed, but as much as possible the business of ingesting, diagnosing, and triaging issues in production services stays in a single person’s hands — keeping the rest of the team focused on shipping great product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;We control our own destiny&lt;/strong&gt; — just like Koan’s culture at large, being on-call is much more about results (uptime, resolution time, pipeline throughput, and learning along the way) than how they come about. Our on-call developer wields considerable authority over how issues are fielded and dispatched, and even over the production release schedule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;We take turns&lt;/strong&gt; — on-call responsibilities rotate weekly. This keeps everyone engaged with the on-call process and avoids condemning any single person to an eternity (or even an extended period) of pager duty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These principles have helped us wrangle a fundamentally interrupt-driven process. What we didn’t realize, though, was how much time — and eventually, value — we were recovering between the fire drills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-bugs-begin"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How bugs begin
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before that, though, we’d be remiss to skip the easiest path to a calm, quiet on-call schedule: don’t release. To paraphrase Descartes, code ergo bugs — no matter how diligent you are in QA, shipping software means injecting change (and therefore new defects) into your production environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not shipping isn’t an option. We’re in the habit of releasing multiple times per day, not to mention all of the intermediate builds pushed to our staging environment via CI/CD. A production issue every now and then is a sign that the system’s healthy; that we’re staying ambitious and shipping fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it also means that things sometimes break. And when they do, someone has to pick up the phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#goals"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Goals
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the bad days, on-call duty is a steady stream of interruptions punctuated by the occasional crisis. On the good days it isn’t much to write home about. Every day, though, there are at least a few minutes to tighten down screws, solve problems, and explore the system’s nooks and crannies. This is an intentional feature (not a bug) of our on-call rotation, and the payoff has been huge. We’ve:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;built shared ownership of the codebase and production systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;systematized logging, metrics, monitoring, and alerting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;built empathy for customers (and our support processes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spread awareness of little-used features (we’re always onboarding)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iterated on key processes (ingestion/triage, release management, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t get all that by just passing around a firefighting hat. You need buy-in and — crucially — a healthy relationship with your production environment. Which brings us back to our principles, and the on-call process that enables it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#we-concentrate-distractions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  We concentrate distractions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When something breaks, the on-call schedule clarifies who’s responsible for seeing it’s fixed. As the proverbial umbrella keeping everyone else focused and out of the rain (sometimes a downpour, sometimes a drizzle), you don’t need to immediately fix every problem you see: just to investigate, file, and occasionally prioritize them for immediate attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That still means a great deal of on-call time spent ingesting and triaging a steady drip of symptoms from:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;customer issues escalated by our customer success team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;internal bug reports casually mentioned in conversations, slack channels, or email threads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exceptions/alerts reported by application and infrastructure monitoring tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes symptoms aren’t just symptoms, and there’s a real issue underneath. Before you know it, the pager starts ringing—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#enter-the-pager"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Enter the pager
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The water’s getting warmer. A pager ping isn’t the end of the world, but we’ve tuned out enough false positives that an alert is a good sign that something bad is afoot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve confirmed a real issue, the next step is to classify its severity and impact. A widespread outage? Those need attention immediately. Degraded performance in a specific geography? Not awesome, but something that can probably wait until morning. Whatever it is, we’re looking to you to coordinate our response, both externally (updating our status page) and either escalating or resolving the issue yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On-call isn’t a private island. There will always be times we need to pause work in progress, call in the team, and get to the bottom of something that’s keeping us down. But the goal is to do it in a controlled fashion, holding as much space for everyone else as you reasonably can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#we-control-our-own-destiny"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  We control our own destiny
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your responsibilities aren’t purely reactive, however. Controlling your own destiny means having at least a little agency over what breaks and when. This isn’t just wishful thinking. While issues introduced in the past are always a lurking threat — logical edge cases, bottlenecks, resource limits, and so on — the source of most new issues is a new release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes sense, then, for whoever’s on-call to have the last word on when (and how) new releases are shipped. This includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;managing the release&lt;/strong&gt; — generating changelogs, reviewing the contents of the release, and ensuring the appropriate people are warned and signatures are obtained&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;debugging release / deployment issues&lt;/strong&gt; — monitoring both the deployment and its immediate aftermath, and remediating any issues that arise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;making the call on hotfix releases and rollbacks&lt;/strong&gt; — as a step sideways from our usual flow they’re not tools we use often. But they’re there (and very quick) if you need them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#closing-the-feedback-loop"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Closing the feedback loop
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An unexpected benefit we’ve noticed from coupling on-call and release management duties is the backpressure it puts on both our release cadence and deployment pipeline. If we’re underwater with issues from the previous release, the release manager has strong incentives to see they’re fixed before shipping anything else. Ditto any issues in our CI/CD processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither comes up too often, fortunately, and while we can’t totally write off the combination of robust systems and generally good luck, it’s just as hard to discount the benefits of tight feedback and an empowered team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#we-take-turns"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  We take turns
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you said, “team!” — a lovely segue to that last principle. Rotating on-call responsibility helps underscore our team’s commitment to leaving a relatively clean bill (releases shipped, exceptions handled; tickets closed; etc) for the next person up. When you’re on-call, you’re the single person best placed to deflect issues that would otherwise engulf the entire team. When you’re about to be on call, you’re invested in supporting everyone else in doing the same. You’d love to start your shift with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;healthy systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a manageable backlog of support inquiries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a clear list of production exceptions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a quick brain-dump of issues fielded (and ongoing concerns) from the teammate you’re taking over from&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A frequent rotation almost guarantees that everybody’s recently felt the same way. Team members regularly swap shifts (for vacations, appointments, weddings, anniversaries, or any other reason), but it’s never long before you’re back on call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-rest-of-the-time"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The rest of the time
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, we’ve arrived at an on-call process that balances the realities of running software in production with a high degree of agency. We didn’t explicitly prioritize quality of life, and we don’t explicitly track how much time on-call duties are eating up. But collective ownership, individual buy-in, and tight feedback have pushed the former up and the latter down, to the point where you’ll find you have considerable time left over for other things. Ideally you’ll use your turn on-call to dig deeper into the issues you touch along the way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exploring unfamiliar features (with or without reported bugs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tightening up our CI processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tuning configurations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;writing regression tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improving logging and observability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, you’ll be triaging issues, squashing bugs, and maybe even putting out the odd production fire. You can almost count on having time left to help minimize the need for on-call. You’re on the hook to fix things if they break — and empowered to make them better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yes, you’ll have to take an on-call shift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Help us make it a good one!&lt;/p&gt;
