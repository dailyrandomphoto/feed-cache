      <title>What is SASS | All-time-dev?</title>
      <author>coding-land</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/codingland/what-is-sass-all-time-dev-188k</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EmZEI3I4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2u5u60q9wk58i2all6gp.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EmZEI3I4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2u5u60q9wk58i2all6gp.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="432"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-sass-alltimedev"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is SASS | All-time-dev?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, we will find out what is SASS. In this post we will find out about its history and what are the advantages, disadvantages, and salary of a SASS/SCSS developer. So, if you are interested and like our posts then share our posts with your developer friends and visit our blog &lt;a href="https://all-time-devlopment.blogspot.com"&gt;all-time-dev&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-sass-its-history-and-why-is-it-used"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is SASS, its history and why is it used?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SASS is a preprocessor scripting language and it mainly has two syntaxes one is the original syntax and the other one is the indented syntax which uses a similar syntax like HAML. It was initially designed by Hampton Catlin and developed by Natalie Weizenbaum and after that Eppstein also joined Natalie Weizenbaum and extended it using SassScript. It first appeared on November 28, 2006, and its stable version was 3.5.6 which was launched on March 23, 2018. It is also known as SCSS and web developers are also using it and its tutorials are freely available on YouTube in Hindi, English, and other languages and you can also find its courses on Udemy, GEEKS-FOR-GEEKS, and other course selling sites. I will also recommend you some videos in our other section. It is written in Ruby and ported in other popular programming languages like C++, JavaScript, JAVA, and more. The full form of SASS is (short for syntactically awesome style sheets). It is used to compile browser compatible CSS because if we write normal CSS then it is not supported by all browsers. So, for that, we have to write code that will be compatible with all browsers like Apple SAFARI, IE 9 or 10, etc and in that case, SASS compiles your written CSS into CSS code compatible for all browsers. And it also helps you to use variables, nested rules and you can write SASS easily by installing an extension called LIVE SASS COMPILER that will help you watch SASS live without saving your sass file time-to-time and compiles your code into CSS in all text editors like Sublime, VS CODE and ATOM, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#difference-between-sass-scss-and-sassscript"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Difference between SASS, SCSS, and SassScript?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also seen that many people have confusion between SCSS, SASS, and SassScript. Some people believe that SCSS and SASS are different. Some people believe they are the same and SassScript is the language in which SASS is written. So, all of these are wrong. SASS is just a preprocessor scripting language and SCSS is the main syntax of SASS and SassScript is itself a scripting language that is used to compute CSS selector, property, or value using Sass expression. So, if you have a doubt between them then it is cleared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#advantages-and-disadvantages-of-sass"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Advantages and Disadvantages of SASS
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SASS is a very good scripting language and it has both advantages and disadvantages. So, now let's discuss them - &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advantages -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It makes your app compatible with all browsers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is very easy to learn &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is very stable and powerful &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is compatible with all versions of CSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helps you write clean and less code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helps you use variables, inline imports, and other functionalities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disadvantages - &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May Cause of losing benefits of browser's built-in element inspector&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Difficult Troubleshooting for developers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code must be compiled before watching CSS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need an internet connection for using it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning SASS is worth it or not?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people also ask questions that are worth learning SASS/SCSS in 2021. So, I think that it is definitely worth learning not only 2021 but for the future also because all the businesses want that their e-commerce stores or websites, blogs, etc must be from all browsers because they want more sales and users and want that everyone should watch their products even if he is watching it from Safari, Chrome or any other popular web browser and the developers want that they have to write less code and they can give more functionalities to attract more clients by his or her work. SASS makes your website, e-commerce store or etc compatible for all popular browsers that a website owner wants that his or her website should everyone view and it provides you functionalities of a mixin that will help you to re-use a code that you have already written in that. CSS page and variables that will help you write less and there are many more features that will help a developer while creating a website like - &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reference symbol ( &amp;amp; ) You might be familiar with the reference symbol, which allows you to reference a parent element as such: &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.block { &amp;amp;.red { color: red; } } &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partials and @import directive. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interpolation. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;@content directive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>What is Developer Advocacy and how to get a job in it?</title>
      <author>Hassan El Mghari</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 05:17:14 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/nutlope/what-is-developer-advocacy-1pf3</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/nutlope/what-is-developer-advocacy-1pf3</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You might have seen Developer Relations (also referred to as DevRel or Developer Advocacy) around Twitter lately and been confused on what it was. Or maybe you have a fuzzy understanding of DevRel and want to learn more about it to try to get a job in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, this blog post is for you. We're going to be talking about what developer relations is, exploring its 3 main areas, then talking about how to land a job in this field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-3-pillars-of-devrel"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The 3 Pillars of DevRel
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we discuss the pillars of DevRel, let's give a quick overview of what it is. DevRel is a role that exists at developer tool companies (companies whose target market is developers). Developer Advocates help raise awareness for a product and collect feedback from the dev community to improve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DevRel has 3 main categories: Community, Content, and Product. Some Devrels do one of these while others are focused on a couple; it ultimately depends on people's skillsets and what the company needs. Both as a startup hiring for devrel and as someone who wants to get into it, it's important to understand these areas to know which you want to focus on. Let's explore each one in more depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6bP55yBM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mrm8f6m7567bd9ew17oq.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6bP55yBM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mrm8f6m7567bd9ew17oq.jpeg" alt="Image description" width="880" height="480"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#community"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Community
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Community-focused DevRel usually centers around growing and managing a community of developers. This is typically a Slack or Discord community that's focused on a product or technology. Managing a community consists of greeting new members, answering questions, designing the community in an inclusive way, and making sure your members are getting value from the community. This can also include livestreams, events, and other activities that help the community grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a technical community builder is a &lt;a href="https://www.swyx.io/community-builder/"&gt;very hot skill to have&lt;/a&gt; nowadays due to the shift developer tool companies are making in the way they obtain their customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#content"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Content
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Content-focused DevRel is about spreading awareness about a product through written and spoken content. This can involve writing blog posts, making videos, teaching workshops, recording podcasts, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#product"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Product
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Product-focused DevRel is about owning the developer exeprience of the product. In other words, it's about improving how it feels for a developer to use a specific product. This can be done by talking to users to understand how they're using it, then making improvements to the documentation and creating guides based on their answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can also extend to the product ecosystem so working on code examples, templates, and integrations is also common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#getting-a-devrel-job"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Getting a DevRel job
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a relatively new role. To stand out though, you should try to have 2 out of 3 of these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can code. For this, you can show off some of your side projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You know how to build communities. You can show off helping build a community or organization if you have any experience in this area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You're a good content creator. You can show off your talks, YouTube videos, tweets, and blog posts for this one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there aren't pre-requisites for the job, it's very helpful to have prior work in these areas to show off and get your career in developer advocacy started. Ultimately, it's for engineers who enjoy working with developers, creating content, and managing communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as you can demonstrate the skills above, you'll likely have no issues finding a role. I also suggest having a website or writing up a document with links to your work to include in your applications. I have a list of some startups that are hiring &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Nutlope/status/1440814837542514703"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this clarified some things for you regarding what DevRel is. If you have any questions, feel free to shoot me a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Nutlope"&gt;DM on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Develope a twitter clone with ReactJS</title>
      <author>Linh Truong Cong Hong</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 05:03:14 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/linhtch90/develope-a-twitter-clone-with-reactjs-2gh5</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/linhtch90/develope-a-twitter-clone-with-reactjs-2gh5</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have developed a small social network web app for educational purpose and want to share this with the community. This app is built with ReactJS for frontend, Java Spring Boot for backend and MongoDB as the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app tries to mimic a few functions of Twitter, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create post with text and image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of characters in each post is limited to 200 characters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Like, comment and re-post a post&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View the number of likes, comments and shares of a post&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comments are toggle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of character in each comment is limited to 100 characters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow, un-follow someone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See who are following us and follow them back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check who we are following&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View all posts of an individual&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View our own posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List all user accounts in the entire social network (due to the number of users are still small, I did not develop search user function)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other functions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to limited storage space, client app compresses the uploaded image to the maximum of 250px (width or height) User avatar is created by hashing user id and convert that hash code into a hexagonal image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authentication and authorization use JWT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Responsive frontend for desktop and mobile devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technical stack:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frontend: ReactJS, Redux Toolkit, React Router, React Bootstrap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backend: Java Spring Boot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database: MongoDB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoy it and give me a ⭐ Github star ⭐ for my effort!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Live Demo and Source Code:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/linhtch90/psn-social-network-public-source"&gt;https://github.com/linhtch90/psn-social-network-public-source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>13 Unique and Fun APIs + Project ideas</title>
      <author>devdefinitive</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 04:54:16 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/devdefinitive/13-unique-and-fun-apis-project-ideas-3766</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/devdefinitive/13-unique-and-fun-apis-project-ideas-3766</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Being a developer is great - you can build almost anything you want! Sometimes, however, it's difficult to decide what to build next as there are so many different project ideas out there. To help you find your next project, I've come up with a list of APIs that you can play with and provided potential project ideas. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#background-remover"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://www.slazzer.com/"&gt;Background Remover&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Background Removal API, Remove the background of any image* with 1 API call. &lt;a href="https://www.slazzer.com/"&gt;Slazzer API&lt;/a&gt; makes it easy for you, it uses AI to remove background from your images, the final image which you get is more clean and good. Simple to use you just have to drag n drop your image into the website and see the awesome result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.slazzer.com/"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt; to API&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#unsplash-api"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/developers"&gt;Unsplash API&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yL1ACzQ---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1619758189436/Urywt3nDB.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yL1ACzQ---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1619758189436/Urywt3nDB.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-04-30 at 10-19-32 Unsplash Image API Free HD Photo API.png" width="880" height="414"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsplash is a website that host "beautiful, free images and photos that you can download and use for any projects". It's API can be used to fetch photos from Unsplash. The Unsplash API could be used to make an application with a background that changes to a random image at different times during the day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/developers"&gt;Link &lt;/a&gt; to API&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-movie-database-api"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the Slack API you can build tools that integrate directly with Slack. The Slack API can be used to build a chat-bot that can carry out various function such as setting reminders, checking the weather or communicating with other APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://api.slack.com/"&gt;Link &lt;/a&gt; to API&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use the Spotify API to create a home automation dashboard that shows what songs I'm currently playing and has controls to play, pause, skip tracks and set the volume (in addition to other functionality). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/"&gt;Link &lt;/a&gt; to API&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Dev.to's or Hashnode's own API you could create your own personal editor that can create, schedule and publish as well as edit old ones. While creating this app you'd have to build a markdown editor and a system to publish you articles to Dev.to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.forem.com/api/"&gt;Link &lt;/a&gt; to API&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any products form the Phillips Hue family, it's likely that they can be controlled using the Hue API. The official app can become a bit busy when you have multiple devices, so you could build an app that can control Hue bulbs around the house, changing their color and brightness. You could also go back to basic and build a command-line app to control your lights!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.meethue.com/"&gt;Link &lt;/a&gt; to the API&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;GO (also called Golang) is an in-demand programming language, especially for people working with Google products. Go is used by many big companies, like Uber Medium, Dropbox, Salesforce, Netflix, IBM, and Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For job seekers of all levels, Go is a fantastic option. But where do you begin? What information do you require? Today, we’ll talk about the ideal way to learn Go and build a strong portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a Golang developer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Golang (also called Go) is a &lt;strong&gt;statically typed, compiled programming language&lt;/strong&gt; that was developed by Google in 2009. The language combines the efficiency of C++ efficiency and the readability of Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Go programming language is used by Golang developers to create websites and apps. Working with Go and its full range of tools and frameworks is part of a Go developer’s job description. Most Go programmers also test and debug their code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unreal Engine vs Unity Engine | Unreal Engine History | All-time-dev&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, we are going to find out what are the top 5 popular game engines. In this post, we are also going to find out the advantages and disadvantages of these game engines and at last, we will find out the best game engine for you. So if you will like our post then share our post with your developer friends and visit &lt;a href="https://all-time-devlopment.blogspot.com"&gt;all-time-dev&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--94BuAAoG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xrttmkt48u0spiziwbkn.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--94BuAAoG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xrttmkt48u0spiziwbkn.jpg" alt="Image description" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#unreal-engine"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Unreal Engine
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This game engine is very popular for creating high-quality AAA games. Unreal Engine has developed many popular games like GOD OF WAR, Ghost Of Tsushima, Halo, Uncharted Series Games, and more. It is owned by popular game company Epic Games. This game engine was developed by Tim Sweeny, who is also the founder of Epic Games. He started developing Unreal Engine in 1995 for the production of a game which was in the future called Unreal. So, this is a simple quick history about Unreal Engine. Now let's find out the advantages of the Unreal game engine, it has all the features like providing pipeline integration, world-building, animation, rendering, lighting, and materials, simulation and effects, developer tools and platforms support, etc. They also have their own asset store where different developer sells many assets like 3D models, animations, audio and visual assets, etc. Their license is free to use and they have a 5 % royalty if your monetized game crosses $3000 but you have to pay taxes. The 5th version of Unreal Engine which is Unreal Engine 5 is on early access. The two key features of this version are Nanite and Lumen. You can visit their official website there they have provided detailed info about these two key features but in simple words, in Nanite you can create high-quality geometric detail, and in Lumen, you can create dynamic global illumination here is the link for more detail. The stable version of Unreal Engine is 4.27 which was released on 19 August 2021, it is written in C++ and its size is around 40.9 GB. And if you want to develop games in Unreal Engine then you have to learn C++ but overall the Unreal game engine is very good. The two main problems with the Unreal Engine are that it needs a very high-end computer to create games on Unreal Engine and another con is that you have to pay taxes if your game has launched. So in these criteria, Unity is better than Unreal Engine.  But before continuing to Unity let's find out about the specs of our favorite Unreal Engine - &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Quickest method to have webpack recompile your files</title>
      <author>smac89</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 04:09:56 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/smac89/quickest-method-to-cause-webpack-to-recompile-your-file-1l4e</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/smac89/quickest-method-to-cause-webpack-to-recompile-your-file-1l4e</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just today I started noticing that when my react code rebuilds, I get eslint errors in the console, but not in my IDE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even stranger was the fact that when I run &lt;code&gt;eslint&lt;/code&gt; by itself in the commandline, it doesn't show that anything was wrong:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;eslint --cache --format stylish --ext '.js,.jsx,.ts,.tsx' --quiet ./
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What gives?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/pPhyAv5t9V8djyRFJH/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/pPhyAv5t9V8djyRFJH/giphy.gif" alt="Come On Reaction GIF" width="480" height="350"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-solution"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The solution
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;touch&lt;/code&gt; command to the rescue. In order to force webpack to recompile the files, they had to be &lt;em&gt;changed&lt;/em&gt; somehow, and I wasn't prepared to manually change each file by hand, recompile, and revert the change, just to wait for another recompilation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I simply used the &lt;code&gt;touch&lt;/code&gt; command on Linux to "touch" all the files which were having that problem, like so:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;touch src/pages/**/*.{js,jsx,tsx,ts}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;shell is zsh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After running this command, webpack was forced to recompile everything and I no longer saw those pesky errors again.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JavaScript object destructuring usages you must know</title>
      <author>Tapas Adhikary</author>

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use JavaScript objects to store data and retrieve it later. We store data(aka information) in &lt;code&gt;key-value&lt;/code&gt; pairs. The key-value pair is also known as the &lt;code&gt;object properties&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an &lt;code&gt;employee&lt;/code&gt; object with three properties: id, name, dept as keys and 007, 'James', and 'Spy' as values.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;employee&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;007&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;James&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;dept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Spy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since ES6(ECMAScript 2015), JavaScript provides a mechanism to handle the properties of objects in a much more innovative way. The mechanism is called &lt;code&gt;Destructuring&lt;/code&gt;(also known as destructuring assignment). It is more of a new syntax added to the language than a feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we will learn about the most crucial usages of object destructuring you must know as a web developer. It will make you a competent and efficient developer. If you know any other cool usages, don't forget to let us know in the comment section below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#use-destructuring-to-retrieve-values-from-an-object"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ⭐ Use destructuring to retrieve values from an object
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most basic usage of object destructuring is to retrieve the value of a property key from the object.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;employee&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;007&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;James&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;dept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Spy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, we will use the dot(.) notation or the subscript([]) notation to retrieve values from the object. The code snippet below shows the example of retrieving the value of &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; from the &lt;code&gt;employee&lt;/code&gt; object using the dot notation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;employee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;employee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No doubt it works perfectly. But think about the tiring typing(or copy-paste-edit) work when you have to do it for many property values? That's where the destructuring assignment syntax comes as a savior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To  destructure a value from an object, you use a syntax like this,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;employee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here, we use the object's key names to create variables and assign them with the value from the object for the same key. In the above code snippet, we retrieve the value of &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; without typing them in multiple lines. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you have 20 more values to retrieve, it is just a matter of specifying those key names with commas. Such a relief!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#use-destructuring-to-retrieve-values-from-a-nested-object"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ⭐ Use destructuring to retrieve values from a nested object
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all practicality, your data object may not be as simple as the &lt;code&gt;employee&lt;/code&gt; object we have seen so far. The object's key can have another object as a value and form a nested object. Let us now see how to retrieve the value for a key from a nested object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is our &lt;code&gt;employee&lt;/code&gt; object where the value of the &lt;code&gt;dept&lt;/code&gt; key is an object. It has a property with the key &lt;code&gt;address&lt;/code&gt; whose value is another object. Great, we are dealing with a nested object here.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;employee&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;007&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;James&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;dept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;D001&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Spy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;street&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;30 Wellington Square&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;city&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Chelsea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's retrieve the value of the &lt;code&gt;address&lt;/code&gt; property traditionally.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;address&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;employee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It works, and the output is,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"street"&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"30 Wellington Square"&lt;/span&gt;,
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"city"&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Chelsea"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now let us go one more level down and retrieve the value of the &lt;code&gt;street&lt;/code&gt; property.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;street&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;employee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;street&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course, we typed more, and the output is,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;30 Wellington Square
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now with destructuring, things are simple. You can define the key name using its predecessor key. So to retrieve the value of &lt;code&gt;address&lt;/code&gt;, we will start with its predecessor key &lt;code&gt;dept&lt;/code&gt;. So, &lt;code&gt;dept&lt;/code&gt; is the top-level key with no predecessor. Hence the syntax is,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;dept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;address&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;employee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;and for the &lt;code&gt;street&lt;/code&gt; property,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;dept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;street&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;employee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;street&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's move to the next one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#define-a-new-variable-with-object-destructuring"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ⭐ Define a new variable with object destructuring
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There could be a situation where you are unsure if the object has a specific key while retrieving its value. Also, you may want to create a new variable with a default value in case the key is unavailable in the object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's take this &lt;code&gt;employee&lt;/code&gt; object for an example,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;employee&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;007&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;James&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;dept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Spy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now let's assume we are trying to retrieve the value of the &lt;code&gt;age&lt;/code&gt; property, which is not present in the object. A traditional way to do that is,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;employee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;employee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If we find the &lt;code&gt;age&lt;/code&gt; property, access its value, and assign it to the variable else, assign a default value of 25. So, how will we do that with the object destructuring syntax we have learned so far?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is pretty simple.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;employee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you see, we can do it easily by specifying the key name along with the default value. It has a similar impact as the traditional way we have learned just now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hold on. The destructuring part has got more magic to show! How about creating a brand new variable and assigning a value computed using the object property values? Sounds complex? Here is an example,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;employee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We create a &lt;code&gt;message&lt;/code&gt; variable and assign a value computed using &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;dept&lt;/code&gt; property values of the &lt;code&gt;employee&lt;/code&gt; object. Powerful, eh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The output is,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;James is Spy
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-use-javascript-object-destructuring-aliases"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ⭐ How to use JavaScript object destructuring aliases?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In JavaScript object destructuring, you can give your destructured variables an &lt;code&gt;alias&lt;/code&gt; name. It comes in very handy to reduce the chances of variable name conflicts.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;employee&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;007&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;James&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;dept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Spy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's assume your source code has an existing variable named &lt;code&gt;dept&lt;/code&gt;. So if we use the same variable name in destructuring, there will be a name conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, you can use an alias name to create the variable with this new name. For example, we can use the alias name &lt;code&gt;department&lt;/code&gt; in this case.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;dept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;department&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;employee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;department&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Spy&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Please note, we have destructured with the alias name, not with the actual key name that is still not defined.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      In JavaScript Object Destructuring, you can give your destructured variables an 'alias' name. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It comes in very handy to reduce the chances of variable name conflicts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Watch Out: Here, you are destructuring with the alias name, not the actual key name that is still not defined.

  &lt;a href="#handle-dynamic-name-property-with-object-destructuring"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ⭐ Handle dynamic name property with object destructuring
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We often handle API response data as JavaScript objects. These objects may contain dynamic data such that, as a client, we may not even know the property key names in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's understand it with an example(same employee object)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;employee&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;007&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;James&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;dept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Spy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Can we write a function that returns the value of the employee object properties when we pass a key as an argument? Yeah, so it means we will not hard-code the key name inside the function. It is dynamic for the function. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the code snippet to showcase how we may call the function.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getPropertyValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getPropertyValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 7 'James'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's define it now.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getPropertyValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;returnValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;employee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;   
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;returnValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Please note the square brackets([..]) around the &lt;code&gt;key&lt;/code&gt; in the destructuring assignment. The key we pass to the function gets evaluated, and the value is retrieved from the object. Isn't that cool. It is efficient usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#destructure-objects-in-the-function-argument-and-return-value"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ⭐ Destructure objects in the function argument and return value
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must learn this usage if you want to explore any modern JavaScript-based frameworks/libraries like React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, etc. You can use object destructuring to pass the property values as arguments to the function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The employee object,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;employee&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;007&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;James&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;dept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Spy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now let us create a simple function that creates a message using the &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;dept&lt;/code&gt; property values to log into the browser console.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;logEmployee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just realize how simple it is. You don't need to take the entire object as an argument and pick the required property values. You pass the values directly as function arguments and use them inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now call the function as,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;logEmployee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;employee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// James is Spy&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is one more usage of object destructuring with function. If a function returns an object, you can destructure the values directly into variables. Let's create a function that returns an object.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Alex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;45&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now if you are interested to retrieve the value of the &lt;code&gt;age&lt;/code&gt; property, you can do it like,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 45&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It indeed saves lots of extra typing and time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#use-object-destructuring-in-loops"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ⭐ Use object destructuring in loops
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last(but not the least) usage we will be discussing is destructuring in loops. Let's think of an array of employee objects. We want to iterate through the array and want to use the property values of each of the employee object.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;employees&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; 
      &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Alex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;15th Park Avenue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;43&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; 
      &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;John&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;33&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; 
      &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Ravi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Bangalore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can use the &lt;code&gt;for-of&lt;/code&gt; loop to loop through the &lt;code&gt;employees&lt;/code&gt; object and then use the object destructuring assignment syntax to retrieve the details. Let us log the name and age of each employee in the browser console.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

      <title>Self-Taught Developer Journal, Day 42: TOP DOM Manipulations and Events Practice cont.</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/jennifer_tieu/self-taught-developer-journal-day-42-top-dom-manipulations-and-events-practice-cont-l09</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#practice-2"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Practice #2:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1anRyL37lE&amp;amp;ab_channel=WesBos"&gt;Event Capture, Propagation and Bubbling video&lt;/a&gt; from Wes Bos’s JavaScript30 program. If you want to code along with the video, you can use the contents of folder #25 from the repo you cloned above.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this video to be very interesting because Event Propagation is definitely something I've never encountered before or wouldn't have know about firsthand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as I liked Wes's explanation of Event Bubbling in the video, I was still unsure of what was happening. I went ahead and Googled for more information about it. I think the GeeksOnGeeks definition captures it really well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Event bubbling is a method of event propagation in the HTML DOM API when an event is in an element inside another element, and both elements have registered a handle to that event. It is a process that starts with the element that triggered the event and then bubbles up to the containing elements in the hierarchy. In event bubbling, the event is first captured and handled by the innermost element and then propagated to outer elements".&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Event Bubbling triggers a selection of all associated elements, a rippling effect. &lt;strong&gt;However, not all events bubble&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An image from &lt;a href="https://javascript.info/bubbling-and-capturing"&gt;javascript.info&lt;/a&gt; was a good visual example of the effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DTPpPSEg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f47jnuol70p9kz0koz4x.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DTPpPSEg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f47jnuol70p9kz0koz4x.png" alt="Event Bubbling example" width="575" height="553"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Event Bubbling can be stopped using the &lt;strong&gt;stopPropagation()&lt;/strong&gt; on the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--npZjEpls--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n4j4gej0wgmrejyprak5.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--npZjEpls--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n4j4gej0wgmrejyprak5.png" alt="stopPropagation" width="880" height="354"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BUT DON'T STOP BUBBLING UNLESS NEEDED!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, the video went over Event Capturing which is another phase of Event Propagation (&lt;em&gt;"Event propagation is a way to describe the “stack” of events that are fired in a web browser.&lt;/em&gt;*)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike Event Bubbling, Event Capturing starts from the top-down to the element. Event Propagation has three phases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capture Phase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Target Phase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bubbling Phase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--elT5_ZJL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/y5wjw7v9g845x04aa074.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--elT5_ZJL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/y5wjw7v9g845x04aa074.png" alt="Event Propagation" width="880" height="733"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capture phase is rarely used and is implemented by setting the handler "capture" option to true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vyingZVs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kc44jtbznve6zyxrrq7v.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vyingZVs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kc44jtbznve6zyxrrq7v.png" alt="Capture Option" width="880" height="329"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xNZVsxK2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b6z1i1fjev074wb7a6dy.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xNZVsxK2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b6z1i1fjev074wb7a6dy.png" alt="Image description" width="600" height="315"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In the information technology industry, getting everyone on the same page is difficult, especially when it comes to software development. Therefore, organizations are searching for people who are ready to get right in and offer the value that DevOps can bring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DevOps, in general, necessitates knowledge of Linux system administration, DevOps tools, and cloud computing. A DevOps engineer helps the development and operations team to coordinate effectively and deliver high-quality products in the least time possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certification courses that focus on the DevOps concepts are the best way to enter into the profession of DevOps. This blog talks about the 10 most valued DevOps certification courses that can help you to get proper DevOps engineer training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-devops"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;What is DevOps?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DevOps is a model that encompasses two terms "development" and "operations". It describes a cooperative or integrated approach for duties performed by a company's development and IT operations teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It helps to foster greater cooperation and interaction across both the aforesaid teams inside a business. Also, DevOps is defined as the use of continuous software development, automation, and programmable infrastructure deployment and maintenance in its most basic form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building trust and harmony between developers and systems administrators, as well as aligning technology to business requirements are all part of the concept. Moreover, the software delivery chain, services, job roles, IT tools, and best practices can all be influenced by DevOps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-do-you-need-devops-certification"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Why Do You Need DevOps Certification?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A DevOps certification confirms an individual’s abilities and expertise, allowing the candidate to construct a strong portfolio. It shows recruiters that you have genuine experience working on real-world projects rather than just academic understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using work performance, numerous exams, tests, and educational courses, certifications demonstrate that you have the necessary skills required to work in a professional and competitive environment. The following are some of the reasons why acquiring a DevOps certification is a smart idea:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can keep up with the most recent DevOps techniques and trends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can use it to showcase certified DevOps expertise on your CV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It shows recruiters that you've gone through a series of tests and quizzes to get the best DevOps training online.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It allows you to display your completed projects as well as your training qualifications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a question, the DevOps profession is one of the highest-paying jobs in the world. As a result, obtaining a DevOps certification is the icing on the cake.&lt;/p&gt;
