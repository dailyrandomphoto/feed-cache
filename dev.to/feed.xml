      <title>Blockchains do a lot more than you think</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Look, I get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past few years have been full of cryptocurrency scams, thinly veiled Ponzi schemes, widespread art fraud for NFTs, and all the other stuff that didn't make the news. Blockchains have been the underlying tech powering all of that, so you have no reason to be be lending any of your trust to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, blockchains are overhyped, and yet they do a lot of good work that you haven't heard of. Just because there are people being stabbed with knives doesn't mean someone somewhere isn't doing a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCGS067s0zo"&gt;masterful job cutting onions!&lt;/a&gt; (weird analogy but bear with me for a moment)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#so-where-are-all-the-onion-masters"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  So where are all the onion masters?
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All right, lets assume blockchains actually do some good stuff. Then why haven't I heard about them? Where is that big app that will make me believe in blockchains?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the answer is not very simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one is going to use something just because its built on blockchains. It has to be good enough to be the best option to choose at the time, never mind what tech is used to build it. Let me explain a bit why a blockchain could be needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll raise you a scenario -- You're happily (or begrudgingly) working along on that task that you need to finish by tonight. Maybe it is so boring and soul-crushing that you're starting to contemplate leaving your job. But that doesn't matter right now,  you're already 2 weeks late and you've run out of excuses. So your only option is to grind through, pull up some NPM packages and finally finish that damn thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait here's the fun part, &lt;strong&gt;NPM is down&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jsfJLpPU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FGwZTczXwA4djk5%3Fformat%3Djpg%26name%3Dlarge" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jsfJLpPU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FGwZTczXwA4djk5%3Fformat%3Djpg%26name%3Dlarge" alt="NPM is down" width="880" height="916"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that wont stop you today! You know that package's Github repo. So you go there, download and store it in your &lt;code&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt;. You hack along undeterred, convinced that you're going to finish it by tonight. Finally its done, reviewed and merged into the dev branch. But wait! Why's it not showing up on the site? The deploy seems to be failing. You google around, ask your team members who are going through their own personal hell, and then finally in your late night, coffee fueled frenzy open up twitter to check what the heck's going on.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Great. AWS is down again. So you just sit there like...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/tJDAeuB5NMtNUx1Swx/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/tJDAeuB5NMtNUx1Swx/giphy.gif" alt="I'm so done" width="480" height="270"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look deeper than the surface level, these are problems that arise due to single points of failure. Its these problems that a decentralised network aims to fix. What's "decentralised"? well, it just means that no single entity is in control of the whole thing. If one node goes down, there's lots of other ones to keep it afloat. When you have your app hosted on a fairly large decentralised network (like ethereum), you essentially have a failsafe for the moment of a node failure. For when one node goes down, the app will just be moved to another node. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you certainly don't need a blockchain for everything, especially if you have control of all the hardware on the network. But in blockchains when anyone can join the network from anywhere in the world, how do you know which node is a bad actor and which isn't. To put it differently, &lt;strong&gt;who do you trust?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/xT8qBnutCq8NxHOn5K/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/xT8qBnutCq8NxHOn5K/giphy.gif" alt="Mr. Robot GIF" width="480" height="258"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, you cant trust anyone over the internet. So you simply take trust out of the equation, that's why you'll often hear the word "trustless" in the context of blockchains. What enables these trustless networks are "consensus algorithms". Simply put, they make sure all the nodes are doing what they're supposed to. They reward the nodes that do good and in a way punish those who don't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#now-on-to-the-onion-masters"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Now on to the onion masters.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully my rambling has made at least some sense to you and you see value in the existence of the blockchain. Now lets introduce you to some of the big (and small) names taking the industry forward:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gSCFTO3S--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b5ibxpdcf9b0jnk73n3s.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gSCFTO3S--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b5ibxpdcf9b0jnk73n3s.png" alt="Ethereum homepage" width="880" height="427"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ethereum-website-link"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Ethereum &lt;a href="https://ethereum.org"&gt;(Website link)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike Bitcoin, which was made to be a currency, Ethereum lets you write something called "Smart Contracts" which basically enable you to run your app on the blockchain. This way your app is up 24/7 and you wont have to deal with &lt;strong&gt;us-east-1&lt;/strong&gt; going down yet again. Although, the main Ethereum network has become quite slow and has a very high transaction fees, there are Level 2 chains that are built on top of Ethereum and are faster and cheaper (but that's a topic for another day).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hZuAtZfY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4tke9m0uera0tans2gdl.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hZuAtZfY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4tke9m0uera0tans2gdl.png" alt="Filecoin website" width="880" height="426"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#filecoin-website-link"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Filecoin &lt;a href="https://filecoin.io"&gt;(Website link)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if you have a lot of important files stored on Dropbox and it goes down just as you want to access one of them? Yes, we're back to that idea of the centralised service that can fail anytime. Filecoin is another blockchain that stores files on a decentralised network. Anyone who stores the files reliably on the network, is paid "Filecoin" (its the name of the organisation AND the cryptocurrency) and whenever someone wants to retrieve those files, they need to pay Filecoin. Think Dropbox, but where all the servers that store data are owned by unrelated individuals around the world who're paid to reliably store data. There's a very good introduction about Filecoin over at their website, I highly encourage you to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#fleek-website-link"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Fleek &lt;a href="https://fleek.co"&gt;(Website link)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lw7sXVaK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5il0tuzwl2eoivlqd5dp.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lw7sXVaK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5il0tuzwl2eoivlqd5dp.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="428"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember how I told you your app can go offline anytime the centralised cloud you're hosting it on experiences an outage? Here's the alternative. Fleek is a "cloud provider" that lets you host apps on Ethereum and files on Filecoin to get rid of the single point of failure problem. It's as easy to use as any cloud provider &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/h09wl5/dear_aws_stop_ruining_the_freaking_console_ui_rant/"&gt;(probably easier)&lt;/a&gt;. This whole goes back to the concept of being the best tool to use irrespective of the underlying tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#thirdweb-website-link"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ThirdWeb &lt;a href="https://thirdweb.com"&gt;(Website link)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VZ1mfxl7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wj5kbn61qy6tanw8ob0f.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VZ1mfxl7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wj5kbn61qy6tanw8ob0f.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="426"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any new technology, building for blockchains is initially hard and cumbersome. It's not as bad as writing machine code by hand, but its certainly not as easy as scaffolding an app with Ruby on Rails (if you know you know). You need to write smart contracts in another language called Solidity, or in the case of &lt;a href="https://solana.com/"&gt;Solana&lt;/a&gt;, you need to write it in Rust. And deploying your app to the chain is certainly not as easy as a &lt;code&gt;git push&lt;/code&gt;ing your Node.js app. But all is not lost, ThirdWeb has recently come up with SDKs in languages like Javascript, Python and Go which makes astonishingly easy to write and deploy "web3" code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Qq1A1C94--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/o1vx1tp8lre21gcegl9m.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Qq1A1C94--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/o1vx1tp8lre21gcegl9m.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="604"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#take-back-control"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Take back control
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you've made it this far into the post you probably see a pattern in all these services. These systems are set up in a way that takes power away from a centralised entity and distributes it to the individual nodes. Ideally these individual nodes are run by one person or a small group of people (which is where a potential problem lies).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#its-not-all-sunshine-and-rainbows"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  It's not all sunshine and rainbows
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If everything goes well, blockchain tech will take away or at least reduce the power held by big tech companies (Meta, Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, etc.). What's bad about them having all this power? Well, if they one day decide to be more greedy, there won't be a viable option elsewhere and people will just have to follow suit regardless. Sure, legal courts can intervene. But that process starts when the damage has already been done, and to be fair legal proceedings can take a fairly long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there's a loophole in blockchains too. It's fine if each person runs one node, then the system is truly decentralised and each person gets their own say. But nothing's stopping you from pooling resources with people and start a crypto mining farm that out competes most single person nodes, and essentially centralises power again (we're already seeing this happen extensively). And remember big tech and its &lt;em&gt;prophecised&lt;/em&gt; demise? Well, nothing's stopping them to start their own mining farm and earn through that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mere existence of blockchain does not guarantee a better future for tech. It has to be actively worked on by enthusiastic developers in every corner to make it work. Or else, it will be just another piece of tech that gets dominated by soulless large corporations whose only aim is to make profits. Which is why you will see supporters of blockchain or "web3" hype it up so much. It is to get more individuals get involved and have a majority stake in it, so that when the big corporations want to have a piece of it, they can only be a minority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So will you help bring power back to the individual or will you let big tech have it all? Will you take the blue pill or the red pill?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You take the blue pill, the story ends. You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zE7PKRjrid4"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: I am in no way affiliated to or supported by any of the above services. I don't even hold any Ethereum (!)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using TypeScript `paths` and `baseUrl` with Parcel</title>
      <author>Alexey Yakovlev</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2021 18:31:54 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/yakovlev_alexey/using-typescript-paths-and-baseurl-with-parcel-204h</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/yakovlev_alexey/using-typescript-paths-and-baseurl-with-parcel-204h</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You might have heard about the new kid on the block of build tools for web - &lt;a href="https://parceljs.org"&gt;Parcel&lt;/a&gt;. It combines great scalable architecture with amazing zero-configuration developer experience while being lightning fast at the same time. You might have even thought about trying it out and maybe moving one of your TypeScript projects to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, if you were leveraging &lt;code&gt;paths&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;baseUrl&lt;/code&gt; TypeScript Compiler options you will likely not have a great time moving - &lt;a href="https://parceljs.org/features/dependency-resolution/#typescript"&gt;Parcel does not support these properties out of the box&lt;/a&gt;. This might be a huge problem for big codebases. You may also prefer TypeScript Compiler's way of handling absolute imports in your project to Parcel's &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; notation. This was the case for me so I decided to try out Parcel plugin ecosystem and create a &lt;a href="https://parceljs.org/plugin-system/resolver/"&gt;Resolver Plugin&lt;/a&gt; of my own to solve this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#parcelresolvertsbaseurl"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  parcel-resolver-ts-base-url
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plugin I created is called &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/parcel-resolver-ts-base-url"&gt;&lt;code&gt;parcel-resolver-ts-base-url&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (name &lt;code&gt;parcel-resolver-tspaths&lt;/code&gt; was already taken by an outdated resolver). It has 0 dependencies (except for peer Parcel, of course) and uses memoization to speed up resolution processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can install &lt;code&gt;parcel-resolver-ts-base-url&lt;/code&gt; using npm or yarn:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm i &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--save-dev&lt;/span&gt; parcel-resolver-ts-base-url
&lt;span class="c"&gt;# or&lt;/span&gt;
yarn add &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-D&lt;/span&gt; parcel-resolver-ts-base-url
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then simply add &lt;code&gt;parcel-resolver-ts-base-url&lt;/code&gt; to your &lt;code&gt;.parcelrc&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"extends"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"@parcel/config-default"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"resolvers"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"parcel-resolver-ts-base-url"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"..."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment parcel doesn't provide a way I know of to specify &lt;code&gt;tsconfig.json&lt;/code&gt; location. Therefore &lt;code&gt;parcel-resolver-ts-base-url&lt;/code&gt; will use &lt;code&gt;tsconfig.json&lt;/code&gt; from the project root.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this point usage will be straightforward - just specify desired aliases in &lt;code&gt;paths&lt;/code&gt; property and projects &lt;code&gt;baseUrl&lt;/code&gt; and start building without ugly relative imports!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#known-issues-and-limitations"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Known Issues and Limitations
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment this plugin is pretty raw and have not been tested in a large amount of use cases. So I figured it would be important to specify what to look for when using &lt;code&gt;parcel-resolver-ts-base-url&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What will work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;baseUrl&lt;/code&gt; imports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;paths&lt;/code&gt; aliases without and with a single wildcard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;paths&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;baseUrl&lt;/code&gt; imports resolving to a npm package with &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;module&lt;/code&gt; fields&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imports resolving to a folder with an index file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imports resolving to files with &lt;code&gt;/(c|m)?jsx?/&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/tsx?/&lt;/code&gt; extensions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What will likely not work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HMR is untested and might not work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resource imports and imports with specified extensions are not supported&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aliases leading to &lt;code&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; will not be resolved as external dependencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom &lt;code&gt;tsconfig.json&lt;/code&gt; names and locations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are having other issues please consider leaving feedback at &lt;a href="https://github.com/yakovlev-alexey/parcel-resolver-ts-base-url/issues"&gt;GitHub Issues&lt;/a&gt; - any feedback would be greatly appreciated. And if you are willing to contribute with solving one of the issues I would be very glad to receive a Pull Request with your solution.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Florence’s Year in Review</title>
      <author>Florence O. </author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2021 18:07:05 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/theflorz/florences-year-in-review-2438</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/theflorz/florences-year-in-review-2438</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s the last day of the year and I look back at the multiple ups and downs, opportunities gained and opportunities lost, the lessons learned and everyone I met that helped shaped my journey, a whole lot happened this year that shaped me as a person and as a woman in tech.  Everything just makes me thrilled and excited for next year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okayyy, let’s take it back to the beginning of 2021 and just kind of run through the wins, lessons, opportunities and fav highlights! 🤩&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/cyyac9sTiN7ji/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/cyyac9sTiN7ji/giphy.gif" width="432" height="308"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;First Quarter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year began with so many uncertainties, I thought I knew what I wanted to get out of the year, I had planned to take on new programming languages, finish my program in school with an amazing grade, land an amazing job and connect with people far and wide. The school year started in Jan and with the lockdown, I had to take classes along with a training program in accordance with my course of study. Juggling school, the training program and freelancing as a web developer was really a lot to juggle but I was able to make it work until I ended the training program in March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By February, my contract with a firm had ended as a web developer and I went back fully into freelancing and got most of my clients from recommendations! I explored technical writing, wrote my first article - &lt;a href="https://dev.to/theflorz/how-to-make-wine-glasses-with-pure-html-css-328g"&gt;https://dev.to/theflorz/how-to-make-wine-glasses-with-pure-html-css-328g&lt;/a&gt;, published it on dev.to and it was a hit!! The article got me the top 7 badge 🥳. That's not all, my second article - &lt;a href="https://dev.to/theflorz/nevertheless-florence-coded-because-nothing-can-stop-her-4m81"&gt;https://dev.to/theflorz/nevertheless-florence-coded-because-nothing-can-stop-her-4m81&lt;/a&gt; was a hit also and yes I got a shecoded badge for participating in this year's shecoded #IWD 🥳. I also got to write product documentations for clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I discovered badminton and loved every bit of it 🏸 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Second Quarter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah yes, more school, more learning and more freelancing. At this point, getting a job became scary because I felt like I wasn't good enough. What kind of brought me some sense of fulfilment was a project I got to work on with data analysts, we worked with PowerBI, MS excel to display interactive graphs, charts etc. I was able to work on more projects with the firm as a freelancer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked on projects that strengthened my frontend skills and WordPress skills, I was starting to implement dynamic websites and UI/UX designs using WP from scratch, who could have thought ? 😅&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More badminton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/3o6ZsYyNQumUyS9t72/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/3o6ZsYyNQumUyS9t72/giphy.gif" width="480" height="270"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Third Quarter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going into August, I started exploring and reading about Product/Project Management and oh did I fall in love with it. I had started talking to a few people about transitioning to Product Management and asking what that would look like, a friend and mentor Geektutor gave me a few pointers and it just made me love every aspect of PM more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started taking a course on project management on Alison, I wasn't even done with the course before I went around telling people to recommend me for any project management roles. I don't know where that confidence came from myself but learning and doing the tasks just made me feel like yes, this is my thing, yes this is me, I love leading teams, I love overseeing project, yes! I can do this, this is all me! And oh did I land my first gig as a Project Manager(I am forever grateful to Caleb for trusting me)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This came with a few doubts and confusions, it was either product or project management, thankfully I had amazing people in my corner and I eventually decided to focus on product management. Oh the project manager role up there ? It got bumped up to product manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got a project management certification and finished my program with a first class!! Whoop Whoop! 🥳&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Fourth Quarter - The big wins!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stepped into the last quarter of the year as a product manager working with an amazing team. Thankfully, I was able to put what I had learned to the test, I had to learn more on my own and I also learnt a lot working on the project. And I paid more attention to my body, started working out and eating healthy 🤩💪🏾.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also got a role as a web developer with Dira Labs and yes, I still freelanced lol. I landed my second PM role working as the PM on an in-house project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My biggest win of the year really came at the end when I applied and got into the Women Techsters bootcamp organized by Tech4Dev an initiative aimed at empowering and introducing women to tech, I applied for the Product Management track and got in! The bootcamp was for 2 weeks, it was really fast paced with hands-on tasks and assignments that helps you master skills. For my track, I was appointed the class captain and as the captain, I created a documentation accessible to my other bootsters that explained how to submit assignments, how to access resources and materials, how to access class recordings, and the documentation also featured useful links. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bootcamp introduced me to aspects of product management such as product roadmap, software development lifecycle, SDLC models, Agile model, Scrum framework, User research, MVP specification, user flow and persona, product/feature PRD, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the bootcamp, we were divided into teams to come up with a product based on any of the United Nations SDGS. For my team, our product FeedAll a food donation app addressed the SDGS goal 2 - Zero hunger and yes, I was team lead haha.  As team lead, I created a product brief, assigned tasks to my team members and also lead stand-ups to check in on tasks progress. As a team member, I was tasked with creating user flow, user persona, product mock-up/protype, MVP specs and compiling my team's PPTX. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will my say PM roles gave me a head start facing these tasks, I was able to seamlessly work with some PM tools such as Miro to create user flow. Having worked with product designers, I was able to find my way around figma to create a high fidelity mock-up and a prototype for the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--x9u_Fvuq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fhl58syl4vx5u6xkxjjv.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--x9u_Fvuq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fhl58syl4vx5u6xkxjjv.png" width="880" height="1100"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;A picture of the Mock-up I made&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was paired with amazing ladies, Funmi, Bolu, Deborah, Audrey, Fredah, Grace, Bukunmi and boy did they deliver on their respective tasks. My team's presentation was met with amazing feedbacks because of our collective efforts and awesome work rate. This article wouldn't be complete without not giving a shoutout to our amazing facilitator Theodora. I have made life long friends and mentor coming out of this bootcamp 🥺❤️.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To wrap up the year, I got a certification in product management, I am still thriving as a web developer and also I got into a product management study group that starts Jan 6th, 2022. 🤩&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/u1Z6oYNZKBtVtlwBgn/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/u1Z6oYNZKBtVtlwBgn/giphy.gif" width="480" height="226"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wrap Up - What next ? &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing this article, I chose to focus more on my wins rather than my losses. Trust me when I say I had my fair share of imposter syndrome, depression, brokeness and self hate, I know what they took away from me and how I had to pick myself back up which is my takeaway of the year - Never give up! Keep going. You'll definitely find your niche and it'll find you too and you'll love each other genuinely. So thank you 2021 for the lessons, the opportunities, the win, the losses and the amazing people in my corner - Elizabeth, Hassan, Daniel, Oluwasayo, Sodiq and my Dira Labs family, Caleb, Yemisi, Aishah, Oyindamola, Rashidat, Janet, Deborah and Ebun, I love you guys so much ❤️❤️❤️. To an amazing 2022! 🥂 &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Worktree? No problem!</title>
      <author>wh1ter4bb1t</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2021 17:41:18 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/wh1ter4bb1tjs/new-worktree-no-problem-hg1</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/wh1ter4bb1tjs/new-worktree-no-problem-hg1</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This is a post shilling one of my github repos, but luckily for you, a shill for broke kids like me is free so if you like it try it&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you heard, git worktrees is a thing. Of course you have, you're a hip young developer, following all the tweet-tweets. Worktrees, a simple concept that has been around for years has been gaining traction over the past couple of years, it's taking the internet by… well a Twitter thread here and there… on occasion… apparently… so I've been told. A single bare repo that you can you create branches as directories off of. It's revolutionary! If you don't understand why people who use worktrees often sing its praises you obviously do not have to deal with a lot of the cumbersome aspects of working with large codebases in large organizations. You lucky sonova….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the rest of us, the amount of times that I had stash my progress in order to checkout a co-workers "urgent" PR is countless, and the mere fact that I no longer have to stash a bunch of things and pray to the our loard and savior Linus Torvalds and can instead keep a worktree called "PR" that I use to checkout PR's is now as easy as well &lt;code&gt;cd ../pr&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one big caveat to worktrees, and a good majority of you readers, especially those who have used worktrees with any JS/TS project before are probably thinking it. I see you, you know whats up, you're looking might fine today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, for those who are uninitiated, every worktree is just a clean pull from your remote repo. Meaning just like using &lt;code&gt;git clone&lt;/code&gt; you have to at least run a clean npm install for every new worktree, not to mention if you have any .env files or anything else that is in your .gitignore that your environment need you have to copy those over from wherever they might be.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is actually not such a big deal you can get both your &lt;code&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; folder and dotfiles from another previous worktree so its just a simple &lt;code&gt;cp .env node_modules&lt;/code&gt; and your done. but if you just cloned that that bare naked repo (naughty) you still need to get those pesky dotfiles from somewhere, and you still need to run that dang npm install. &lt;br&gt;
However, like any true developer the mere fact that you have to think about all that and type the same same thing over and over for every new worktree should give shivers up your spine. And this is probably a good reason why a lot of web developers shy away from worktrees. Why go through that pain? We are pioneers! How dare someone set up a system that makes us have to type more! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter my stupid ADHD brain.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/z8rEcJ6I0hiUM/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/z8rEcJ6I0hiUM/giphy.gif" alt="accurate depiction of my brain" width="360" height="202"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if we unloaded our dotfiles to a completely different directory. and we kept that separate from everything else, you already do that with your config files(yeah I know whats going on that root directory that you can't be bothered to clean). I like my machine to be sleek and clean and only be running the projects I am working on at a single time. This means I could remove a repo once I was done with it on my local machine but still hold on to the dotfiles so that in the future when a client asks to change back that terrible idea that they had and wouldn't listen to reason I can quickly pull it down and still have the dotfiles. Great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let's take that one step further. What if we could do that with the node modules as well. Sure it bloats our computer a bit depending on how many projects we have but it saves that time of running npm install on every new worktree. And let's be honest here, if you're working with Javascript or Typescript you accept the bloat, nay, you embrace is. STONKS BABY!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, let's imagine that its the first worktree in a new repo that we just cloned down for the first time. We don't have the &lt;code&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; directory for it so naturally we have to run an npm install. It's a pain but it's the first time we pulled the repo down, it can't be helped. However, I'm a one and done kinda guy. so let's make it so that if we run an npm install it should copy over those newly minted &lt;code&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; to the correct dotfiles directory, because why should we go through the struggle of pressing those half-dozen or so keys. Do I go to work to work? NO, We want that automated.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/1lxryzbQaqo49cKhCw/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/1lxryzbQaqo49cKhCw/giphy.gif" alt="automated" width="480" height="270"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;finally, what if we are working with a couple different environments and… well our node configs are different for each of those environments well we should probably keep all those in our dotfiles directory as well. And we should probably realize that as developers our ability to name those environments extends to "prod", "test", "dev", "staging", "dev-feature", "dev-feature2"… I named these, but do you think I can be bothered to remember which is which? No, and I refuse to. Again, why work on bettering myself? The computer should better itself… and then, you know, eventually, maybe help me do my job better… But its on the computer!&lt;br&gt;
Enter, a fuzzy-finder to help coax my numb little brain into remembering which "dev-feature-blah-blah" I want. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--V59piXqy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vh9r8bo382fv2u9j1ut5.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--V59piXqy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vh9r8bo382fv2u9j1ut5.jpg" alt="lazy me" width="880" height="572"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so if your with me, and you have to work with package managers then you should understand that what we are looking for is a simple command that we can enter that will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;open a fuzzy finder of dotfile directories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;checks if there is a node_modules directory in the chosen dotfiles &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if there isn't, run npm install(again, I'm lazy. I cant be bothered to type npm i)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if npm install was ran, copy over the new node_modules to that same dotfiles directory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if there is already a node_modules directory just copy that over to the current worktree(why waste time and bandwidth, if we got it already)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;copy over any .env files we might have to the current worktree&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh and probably as a last little thing, we might want a check to just exit out if conditions aren't met. If I make this script and it has some shortcut my fat little stubby fingers are bound to accidentally bump those keys at some point and I don't need some script to come harass me or try to do all this work in folders that don't need it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter, &lt;a href="https://github.com/wh1ter4bb1t-js/nw"&gt;NW&lt;/a&gt;. Short for New Worktree… or North West if you're looking at a map or compass. A small little bash script that solves the above issue in the manner that we just outlined. And as a script, you can easily make a git hook or shortcut or add it to something like your editor to run automatically when you create a new worktree. I'm trying to solve a problem here people. My fingers, are short, stubby, there's no finger treadmill to get them slim and fit enough for writing npm install and cp .env . every time I make a new branch on my local machine. No, my fingers prefer to lay around all day and do nothing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you are interested in looking at this. Trying it out for yourself, seeing how it feels. heck if you want give your own fingers a push up(a single one, because thats all the work out they should need) and make some changes to the script to fit your own needs go for it, maybe even make a PR if your feeling adventurous. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/wh1ter4bb1t-js/nw"&gt;Lazy developers unite!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Making Weather App using Tailwind CSS using OpenWeatherMap.org in JavaScript</title>
      <author>Ashutosh Dash</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2021 17:29:12 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/ashutoshdash/making-weather-app-using-tailwind-css-using-openweathermaporg-in-javascript-4ifj</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/ashutoshdash/making-weather-app-using-tailwind-css-using-openweathermaporg-in-javascript-4ifj</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey folks, in this article I'll show how you can create your own weather app using TailwindCSS using OpenWeatherMap.org in JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-generating-api-key-from-openweathermaporg"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Generating API key from OpenWeatherMap.org
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href="//openweathermap.org"&gt;OpenWeatherMap.org&lt;/a&gt; and create your account, after all the steps you will be redirected to dashboard, in the top menu click on &lt;code&gt;API Keys&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6H_d4nPP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7fi2epwdcb4ifvn9yx1e.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6H_d4nPP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7fi2epwdcb4ifvn9yx1e.jpg" alt="Open Weather Map Dashboard" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now copy the API key and paste it here in the place of {API Key}.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${city}&amp;amp;units=metric&amp;amp;APPID={API Key}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This will be our API URL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read more about the API documentation &lt;a href="https://openweathermap.org/guide"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-testing-the-api"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Testing the API
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open your project folder and create &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;script.js&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Open your browser and in the search bar enter the API URL with the city name and API key. If the result is as follows that means API is working fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sFar1v98--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/m9f1tewooxf075tycnig.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sFar1v98--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/m9f1tewooxf075tycnig.jpg" alt="Test API is working or not" width="880" height="338"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that open up your &lt;code&gt;script.js&lt;/code&gt; file and write following code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--J-e9nE2L--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yf5ffngdfdfx2lb8nvk9.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--J-e9nE2L--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yf5ffngdfdfx2lb8nvk9.jpg" alt="Initial Code" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, we created a button, which on clicking give us the output of API URL in JSON format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zlmIjIVo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q57uvu5fqvnpayfez6os.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zlmIjIVo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q57uvu5fqvnpayfez6os.png" alt="API Output" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, we can see what the weather API offer us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-generating-html"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Generating HTML
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For starters, we will create HTML file to show basic info like weather, temperature, wind Speed, humidity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;section class="container"&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;input type="text" name="" placeholder="Search city name here..." id="city-name"&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;button id="findBtn"&amp;gt;Find Weather&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;section class="result-container"&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Weather: &amp;lt;span id="weather-description"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Temperature: &amp;lt;span id="temp"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Wind Speed: &amp;lt;span id="wind-speed"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Humdity: &amp;lt;span id="humidity"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;

    &amp;lt;script src="script.js"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Output&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FjG6IYzu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9zr40vzvwfrposlpw4uq.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FjG6IYzu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9zr40vzvwfrposlpw4uq.png" alt="HTML Output" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-creating-the-javascript-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Creating the JavaScript code
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final javascript code looks like this in &lt;code&gt;script.js&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;// input 
let findBtn = document.querySelector("#findBtn");
let city = document.querySelector("#city-name");

// output
let weatherDescription = document.querySelector("#weather-description");
let temp = document.querySelector("#temp")
let windSpeed = document.querySelector("#wind-speed");
let humidity = document.querySelector("#humidity");


function getWeatherAPI(){
    let apiURL = `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${city.value}&amp;amp;units=metric&amp;amp;APPID={API Key}`;
    fetch(apiURL)
    .then(response =&amp;gt; response.json())
    .then((data)=&amp;gt; {
        weatherDescription.innerHTML = data.weather[0].description;
        temp.innerHTML = `${data.main.temp}°C`;
        windSpeed.innerHTML = `${data.wind.speed}m/s`;
        humidity.innerHTML = `${data.main.humidity}%`

    })
}

findBtn.addEventListener("click", getWeatherAPI);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-using-tailwind-css"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Using Tailwind CSS
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now adding some Tailwind CSS in &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; for our app.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;body class="text-center bg-gradient-to-r from-cyan-500 to-blue-500"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;section class="container p-8 text-center flex flex-col justify-center items-center"&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;h1 class="text-3xl font-bold p-2 m-2"&amp;gt;Open Weather&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;input class="border-b-4 border-b-blue-900 rounded-lg p-2 text-xl focus:outline-none" type="text" name="" placeholder="Search city name here..." id="city-name"&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;button class="border-2 border-teal-800 rounded-lg p-2 text-xl text-center transition ease-in-out delay-150 active:scale-95 bg-gradient-to-r from-emerald-500 to-teal-500 drop-shadow-md hover:drop-shadow-2xl" id="findBtn"&amp;gt;Find Weather&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;section class="result-container p-4 m-4 grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4  gap-4"&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;div class="weather border-2 p-4 m-4 rounded-lg backdrop-blur-md drop-shadow-xl"&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Weather:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;p class="font-bold" id="weather-description"&amp;gt;_ _&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;div class="temp border-2 p-4 m-4 rounded-lg backdrop-blur-md drop-shadow-xl"&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Temperature:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;p class="font-bold" id="temp"&amp;gt;_ _&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;div class="windSpeed border-2 p-4 m-4 rounded-lg backdrop-blur-md drop-shadow-xl"&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Wind Speed:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;p class="font-bold" id="wind-speed"&amp;gt;_ _&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;div class="humidity border-2 p-4 m-4 rounded-lg backdrop-blur-md drop-shadow-xl"&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Humidity:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;p class="font-bold" id="humidity"&amp;gt;_ _&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7QslJ-Md--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/twnq3qr4bhowdfxqg25g.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7QslJ-Md--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/twnq3qr4bhowdfxqg25g.png" alt="Tailwind Output" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-final-project-demo"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. Final Project Demo
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7n0jLSwS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i40bdgyapcvmf61teco5.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7n0jLSwS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i40bdgyapcvmf61teco5.gif" alt="Final Project Demo" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So thats it folks. This project may seem overwhelming to begineer but trust me its really easy. To newbies, try your head around JavaScript &lt;code&gt;promises&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt; and play around with other free API available.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Feel free to connect with me over &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashutoshdash1999/"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; or shoot me a mail on &lt;a href="//mailto:dashashutosh1999@gmail.com"&gt;dashashutosh1999@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Image Search App in 10 MINUTES Challenge - Unsplash Api and CSS grid</title>
      <author>Sebastian</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2021 17:26:50 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/sebcodestheweb/image-search-app-in-10-minutes-challenge-unsplash-api-and-css-grid-ako</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/sebcodestheweb/image-search-app-in-10-minutes-challenge-unsplash-api-and-css-grid-ako</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#i-made-an-image-search-app-that-in-10-minutes-can-search-a-list-of-images-using-a-keyword-from-the-unsplash-api"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  I made an image search app that in 10 MINUTES, can search a list of images using a keyword from the Unsplash API.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Checkout the deployed project here: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://photosearch-unsplash.netlify.app/"&gt;https://photosearch-unsplash.netlify.app/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch the YouTube video: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7EArFLOI8ek"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#hello-and-welcome-to-my-blog"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Hello, and welcome to my blog! 😊
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this video, I make  a photo search app, that takes in a keyword and return 10 images that is taken from the unsplash.com API. The user can search with any keyword and scroll through to the next / previous page. This is a challenge, and my fourth attempt when I finally managed to code the app in less than 10 minutes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can view all the code on Github: &lt;a href="https://github.com/SebCodesTheWeb/photosearch"&gt;https://github.com/SebCodesTheWeb/photosearch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-it-works"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  --How it works--
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's quite simple. I align everything using css grid, and have 10 empty images when the website first loades. I use a css background pattern and some hover effect to make everything look nice. When the user types in a keyword and clicks on submit the code makes a request to the unsplash api, and returns a list of urls related to that keyword. It then sets the src attribute of those images to the urls returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fetch call looks like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;displayImages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;keyword&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`https://apis.scrimba.com/unsplash/search/photos?query=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;keyword&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;amp;page=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nx"&gt;images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;urls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;small&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And that's more or less it, the only hard part is making everything come together in 10 minutes ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;

  --About me--
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello! My name is Sebastian, and I'm a high-school student from Sweden. I have dabbled with some front-end development for the past few months. And since Christmas brake finally arrived, I've decided to start a challenge for myself! I'm going to code for the coming 20 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm following the front-end career path at Scrimba and I'm currently at module 8 (Flexbox, Grid and Fetch)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of the 20 days I'm hoping to have finished the front-end career path and have started with some backend Node.js development. I will be documenting my progress for the coming days, and filming myself on my Youtube-channel, so feel free to follow along my journey and learn with me!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;charset=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"UTF-8"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Create Website with Auto Typing Text Effect&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;rel=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"stylesheet"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"style.css"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;header&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;nav&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"img/logo.png"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;alt=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"logo"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/nav&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

      <title>List all the files containing a phrase | ag, rg</title>
      <author>Waylon Walker</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2021 16:38:09 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/waylonwalker/list-all-the-files-containing-a-phrase-5clm</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/waylonwalker/list-all-the-files-containing-a-phrase-5clm</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most useful skills you can acquire to make you faster at almost any job that uses a computer is getting good at finding text in your current working diretory and identifying the files that its in.  I often use the silver searcher &lt;code&gt;ag&lt;/code&gt; or ripgrep &lt;code&gt;rg&lt;/code&gt; to find files in large directories quickly.  Both have a sane set of defaults that ignore hidden and gitignored files, but getting them to list only the filenames and not the matched was not trivial to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've searched throught he help/man pages many times looking for these&lt;br&gt;
flags and they always seem to evade me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ag"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ag
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passing the flag &lt;code&gt;-l&lt;/code&gt; to ag will get it to list only the filepath, and not the match. Here I gave it a &lt;code&gt;--md&lt;/code&gt; as well to only return markdown filetypes.  &lt;code&gt;ag&lt;/code&gt; supports a number of filetypes in a very similar way.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ag nvim &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--md&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-l&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#rg"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  rg
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giving &lt;code&gt;rg&lt;/code&gt; the &lt;code&gt;--files-with-matches&lt;/code&gt; flag will yield you a similar set of results, giving only the filepaths themselves and not the match statement.  Also passing in the &lt;code&gt;-g "*.md"&lt;/code&gt; will similarly yield only results from markdown files.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;rg &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--files-with-matches&lt;/span&gt; you &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-g&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"*.md"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>5-must visit useful websites for developers..</title>
      <author>Neha Choudhary</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2021 16:30:51 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/nehachoudhary19/5-must-visit-useful-websites-for-developers-5cl4</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/nehachoudhary19/5-must-visit-useful-websites-for-developers-5cl4</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;oday I came across some amazing websites🙂 and thought to share it with everyone. Actually, there are many websites all around which we might not be aware of. &lt;br&gt;
Here are some amazingly-killer websites for developers.😁&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, are you always wondering and searching about roadmaps on google, YouTube and many more.🤔 Then this website is basically for you..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://roadmap.sh/"&gt;roadmap.sh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roadmap.sh is a storehouse of numerous roadmaps, guidelines and also other educational content which you could easily refer to and choose an appropriate path to achieve your goals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This is a screenshot of the website for reference)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UlQc6gNf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r4jp9wr2rr4f3qcn7e0v.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UlQc6gNf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r4jp9wr2rr4f3qcn7e0v.png" alt="roadmap" width="880" height="484"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if you are learning frontend and getting hands dirty with CSS then you really need some cool css-tricks.🤩&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://css-tricks.com/"&gt;CSS-Tricks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that CSS is to make our web look beautiful but this website makes working with CSS even more beautiful and amazing. You can get amazing content on this website as it contains videos, guides, books and articles related to the same.😌👇&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2rWAs7PO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rhx1ry9lhzd558ws07vu.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2rWAs7PO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rhx1ry9lhzd558ws07vu.png" alt="css-tricks" width="880" height="485"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://smartmockups.com/"&gt;SmartMockups&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SmartMockups enables you to create high resolution mockups directly inside the browser across multiple devices. It is comparatively quite easy as compared to photoshop and also very user-friendly.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SHVg04Qo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/z0qu8g57jdyddmezj9oa.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SHVg04Qo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/z0qu8g57jdyddmezj9oa.png" alt="smartmockups" width="880" height="480"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pfpmaker.com/"&gt;Profile Pic Maker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In today's world, profiles pictures have become very important as we do need them all around like on social media - Facebook, Instagram etc. And also sometimes a professional profile photo is also needed. So, this website creates a  profile for a photo and is very user-friendly i.e. easy to use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xhgzSR1f--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1ev804azs28fwdlrch5t.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xhgzSR1f--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1ev804azs28fwdlrch5t.png" alt="pf maker" width="880" height="482"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning any programming language is not that hard as to remember each and every syntax or details of it and hence a reference is required for its quick overview.🤭 If yes, then overAPI is one of the best websites for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://overapi.com/"&gt;overAPI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;overAPI contains cheatsheet of almost every programming language and technologies.🤩&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--T0wR_xqM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hek2sccc1qa5cav6kwqu.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--T0wR_xqM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hek2sccc1qa5cav6kwqu.png" alt="overapi" width="880" height="546"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this was all about the 5-amazing websites. Hope you liked it!!😇&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Looking Back On 2021 - A Year In Review</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A life they say is full of sweet and bitter moments and I'm grateful my sweet moments outweigh the bitter ones even though the pandemic made things a lot more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Received good reviews on my articles (one of the best wins)💃.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--K8d7-K73--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33374159/147830062-7f40da3d-a78d-4f13-9d36-0807fd9a6903.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--K8d7-K73--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33374159/147830062-7f40da3d-a78d-4f13-9d36-0807fd9a6903.png" alt="review" width="880" height="73"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TVEB8DPN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33374159/147830393-e45445d3-79b9-4f22-bb8c-b05bfe008b70.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TVEB8DPN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33374159/147830393-e45445d3-79b9-4f22-bb8c-b05bfe008b70.png" alt="review2" width="443" height="87"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aced two out of three DevOps interviews. Got an offer from one of them🔥.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Left a toxic workplace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Completed my &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Youth_Service_Corps"&gt;National Youth Service Corps (NYSC)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved my mental health.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passed the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam🎉.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Got a lot of swags from different companies (the sweetest).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Got selected as a Runner-up for the 2021 GitHub actions hackathon on Dev🔥🔥.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DeUVxdTa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33374159/147829961-5b06d7a6-57f1-4fa5-885e-628c700733a1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DeUVxdTa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33374159/147829961-5b06d7a6-57f1-4fa5-885e-628c700733a1.png" alt="hackathon" width="880" height="374"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Successfully transitioned from web development to cloud engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Made new and amazing friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-bad"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Bad
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Burnout. I was doing a lot of things together, a full time role with two writing gigs and a Udacity course were just too much for me to handle. I had to drop the writing gigs at some point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Got a rejection from one of the  two DevOps interviews I thought I aced.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--umgTkIyE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33374159/147830015-fcee416b-6cef-453a-adac-7b20b6b7f706.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--umgTkIyE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33374159/147830015-fcee416b-6cef-453a-adac-7b20b6b7f706.png" alt="zcash" width="880" height="109"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turned down the opportunity to speak at two events  due to imposter syndrome and lack of preparation time. I hope to do more public speaking next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My social life was a mess and I hope to fix it next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, I’m happy for my growth, even with the obstacles and challenges. I hope things get much better next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading and wishing you all the very best in 2022!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>🤯 How to Get More Stars on GitHub!</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/williammcgonagle/how-to-get-more-stars-on-github-5a66</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working on &lt;a href="https://github.com/fairfield-programming/backend-server/"&gt;my open-source backend server&lt;/a&gt; for about a week now, and it already has about 12 stars, 9 forks, and nearly 10 outside contributors. That might not sound like a lot, but the project is only a week old and it isn’t a package or anything that can be used by outside people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, how did I do it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important thing has been issues. When GitHub was developing issues, they secretly made the most overpowered label that there is, “good first issue”. I can guarantee that if you create a new issue every two hours on your repository that has “good first issue” on it, you will get outside collaborators. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/fairfield-programming/backend-server/"&gt;Don’t forget to Star the Backend Server&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What else can help with your labels? If you use emojis in the title, anyone that sees your issue will be instantly drawn to it because it is more colorful. This will increase the amount of views on your issue, and increase the likelihood of someone to help you with it as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you create a todo list in every issue, this tricks the GitHub system into thinking it’s a bigger issue, and it also tricks the websites, like ‘goodfirstissues.com’ into moving it higher in the rankings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be more tips like this coming tomorrow and the day after, so if you liked hearing this, make sure to follow me, so you can see more tips as they come out. &lt;/p&gt;
