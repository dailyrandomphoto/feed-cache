      <title>7 Tips to Crush Your Next System Design Interview</title>
      <author>Daniel Emod Kovacs</author>

      <link>https://dev.to/superbet/7-tips-to-crush-your-next-system-design-interview-4cfe</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/superbet/7-tips-to-crush-your-next-system-design-interview-4cfe</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is no secret that the tech industry is blooming right now. Many big tech companies are expanding at a mind-boggling pace, which of course means a rapid influx of applicants. This leads to a need for optimising and streamlining the interview experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We at &lt;a href="https://superbet.engineering"&gt;Superbet&lt;/a&gt; invest a lot into making our interviews concise, comprehensive and reproducible, to ensure all applicants get a fair and equal chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the essential parts of our interview process is the &lt;strong&gt;System Design Interview&lt;/strong&gt;. It is not something we invented, but I think we're pretty good at giving candidates fair, yet challenging problems to think about for this ~1 hour section of our hiring flow. In my first 6 months of working at Superbet as a tech lead, I've conducted more than 20 interviews - the majority of which had been focusing on system design. With that experience in my bag, I'll spoil you with the best 7 pieces of advice I could come up with to help you ace your next system design interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a system design interview you're presented with a technical problem, e.g.: "how would you design an application, like DEV.to?" and your task is to talk the interviewers through your solution while covering a couple of different topic, e.g.: data modelling, services, scaling, frontend, logging and error handling, just to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-understand-the-problem"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Understand the Problem
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may sound cliché, but understanding the problem you're presented is going to give you a great advantage. So many candidates rush into trying to pump out a solution as quickly as they humanly can, without taking the time to really try to understand the question or problem in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's examine why system design interviews exist and what we're trying to measure. Contrary to popular belief, after the interview concludes, we don't actually take the plan you've given us and turn it into the next unicorn startup. We're actually okay with you not giving us a full solution. What we're looking for is the way you approach a technical problem and how well you can reason about your decision making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The skills you will showcase during the system design interview will be able to tell us how well you'll manage problems in all sort of areas of engineering and not just in the specific environment that's presented during the interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-collect-all-of-the-requirements"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Collect all of the Requirements
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big mistake a lot of good engineers make, when tackling a system design interview is the lack of questions about the problem. We can't really score you on the assumptions you've made during the interview, although they do give us good insight into how your mind works. It's always safer to just take your time and ask all of the questions that come to your mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to say this phrase when introducing the system design interview to candidates who hadn't had a chance to take part in one yet: "your questions are just as valuable as your answers".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good rule of thumb is, if you're about to answer a question starting with "it depends", instead, explain that you need further clarification of specific parameters of the problem that will help you inform your decision. For example, don't just assume you can use AWS for everything. Certain countries may have regulations that prohibit businesses in a couple of different sectors from relying on cloud infrastructure and therefore you'd need to take into consideration the use of on-premise solutions if this is the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-focus-on-note-taking"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Focus on Note Taking
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I have a horrible short term memory. To help with remembering details I take notes throughout the day and review them regularly. You don't have to have a bad memory to take advantage of note taking. It will not only benefit you in an extremely stressful situation, by taking reliance on your memory out of the equation, but it also helps interviewers by showcasing what information you're focusing on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a system design interview will present you with a complex problem, especially as you climb higher on the engineering ladder. It's okay to lose track during the interview, however, the way you handle the situation or prevent it from happening in the first place is what's really important to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're sharing your screen during the interview or are doing the interview in person, you will have a way of showing your notes to your interviewers. I recommend making sure they're aware that you're taking notes and ask if they're interested in your notes. Chances are they will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-use-a-visualisation-tool"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Use a Visualisation Tool
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result of the system design interview is a snapshot of a working system with explanation of the choices you've made while coming up with the design. One of the biggest challenges for both the interviewers and the candidates is to keep track of the final solution. We always recommend our candidates to use a visualisation tool that can not only help them with an overview of what they have so far, but also to help us see the solution at a bird's eye view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tool I recommend using is &lt;a href="https://app.diagrams.net/"&gt;Draw.io&lt;/a&gt;. The disadvantage of it is that there's no live sharing feature, so the only way for us to see your solution is for you to share your screen. &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com"&gt;Google Docs&lt;/a&gt; is also a viable alternative, albeit with limited options when it comes to drawing shapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-do-not-get-lost-in-the-details"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Do Not Get Lost in the Details
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your solution should be comprehensive and should cover a wide array of topics of software design. It's also important to discuss edge cases and non-critical system components, e.g.: logging. The number one reason candidates fail to deliver a full solution to the system design interview on time is lack of focus on higher level issues, a.k.a.: getting lost in details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make sure you don't lose yourself in the little details of your solution, I recommend the following approach. Instead of picking the area you're most familiar with, and expanding on it horizontally - you should start at the highest possible level. Explain what you expect your application to be able to do and then work your way down into the specifics of each component of the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an interviewer, I want to intervene as little as possible during the interview. I want to keep the candidate talking, without having to guide them. When you get lost in the details, your interviewer has to make a decision to intervene and interrupt the flow or let you talk, but risk you wasting precious time in details that are not required in your solution. The best way to make sure you provide enough detail is to ask before you give your solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-talk-through-your-process"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. Talk Through Your Process
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my experience, the most successful candidates all have one quality in common. They are vocal. You might be someone who finds it easy to talk through your thinking process, however that isn't true for everybody and I appreciate that. It's something not everyone's good at naturally, however I recommend practicing thinking out loud, while you're preparing for an interview and you'll find it easier to do during your system design interview as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this important at all? To be an effective engineer, your communication skills are extremely important. For more junior engineers we want to make sure that you'll be able to ask your more senior teammates for advice when working on your tasks, while as a senior, we're looking for you to be able to jump in and mentor your teammates, as well as take part in discussions about tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#7-do-not-be-afraid-to-ask-for-help"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  7. Do Not Be Afraid to Ask for Help
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you're doing your system design interview at Superbet, we'll try to create the atmosphere of a nice open-ended discussion between tech enthusiasts. As such, we'll be open to answering any and all of the questions you may come up with during the interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wanted to say during an interview: "I'd just Google x and y"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a system design interview it's okay not to know the exact technology or library that you'd use for a solution. In the real world you will be able to get help with all of that, whether it be reading documentation or looking the problem up on StackOverflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I'd use Redis, because I don't have to worry about persistence or memory use, but I need very quick reads and a way to publish changes as they happen"&lt;/em&gt; scores just as well as &lt;em&gt;"I'd use an in-memory database, because I don't have to worry about memory and they have quicker access speeds. If it's got built in pub/sub, it's even better. Can you suggest such a database?"&lt;/em&gt;. Remember, we're interested in your reasoning above all and if the actual answer is just a Google search away, we'll be happy to help you out with it.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven't been in a system design interview or are looking to improve the outcome of your next one, hopefully my tips will get you there. Remember, your mileage may vary. Not everybody does interviews the same way, so if you want to be safe, you can use all of the above in your interview at Superbet.

      <title>You want enabling CSS selectors, not disabling ones</title>
      <author>Silvestar Bistrović</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 11:10:29 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/starbist/you-want-enabling-css-selectors-not-disabling-ones-4l63</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/starbist/you-want-enabling-css-selectors-not-disabling-ones-4l63</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;An enabling selector is what I call a selector that does a job without disabling the particular rule. I'll explain using the following example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say we have list items and we want to add the margin to the last one.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Item 1&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Item 2&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Item 3&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Item 4&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Item 5&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here's the usual, disabling way.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin-bottom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1em&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:last-child&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin-bottom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, we add &lt;code&gt;margin-bottom&lt;/code&gt; to all elements. Then, we disable the bottom margin on the last element. I call this technique disabling selector since the &lt;code&gt;li:last-child&lt;/code&gt; selector disables the previous selector's rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we could do better using enabling selectors.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:last-child&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin-bottom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1em&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The selector &lt;code&gt;li:not(:last-child)&lt;/code&gt; is enabling &lt;code&gt;margin-bottom&lt;/code&gt; on all elements except the last one. There's no need to disable anything. That is much readable and maintainable if you ask me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's another version of the enabling selector for the same example.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin-top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1em&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this version, we add &lt;code&gt;margin-top&lt;/code&gt; to all elements that have a previous sibling, which means to all elements except the first one, which doesn't have a previous sibling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you have it, enabling selectors that do a better job in less code. Here's the demo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/CiTA/embed/WNogPdB?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=css&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/notmahnoor/kickass-vs-code-extensions-to-make-your-life-easy-27mn</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of some of the extensions that could be useful for primarily front-end developers who want to get the most out of their VS Code. You might be familiar with a lot of them, or you might be not. Either way, these extensions can drastically improve your workflow and make your IDE more attractive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#for-faster-coding"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/mathew_b/cryptocurrency-exchange-software-and-their-types-16lc</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cryptocurrency exchange software is a ready-to-deploy, ready-made software using which you can launch an entirely operable cryptocurrency exchange. By using a crypto exchange software, you can deploy a feature-rich, technically advanced cryptocurrency exchange platform where anyone is entitled to buy, sell and trade cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like conventional trading exchanges, cryptocurrency exchange facilitates trade activities involving digital currencies. You can carry out buy, sell, trade or hold cryptocurrency and gain considerable profits from it.The recent years have witnessed a mass adoption of cryptocurrencies. On seeing the potential profit margin combined with the user count, several new startups have emerged. By taking advantage of the increase in demand for a new business, entrepreneurs started to inherit cryptocurrency exchange for business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The level of revenue that comes with integrating a cryptocurrency exchange is the fuel beneath the launch of multiple crypto exchanges all over the globe. Having said that, there are several branches and classifications based on which a cryptocurrency exchange is categorized. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--s2ACc9Wh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rpb6m10jre083e42bomh.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--s2ACc9Wh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rpb6m10jre083e42bomh.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#types-of-trading-platforms-in-cryptocurrency-exchange-software"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Types of trading platforms in cryptocurrency exchange software:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any freshly emerged business module has to have varied options in order to reel in more users as well as businessmen. Inheriting a cryptocurrency exchange software is no exception to that. Basically, there are three basic type of cryptocurrency exchanges:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orders Book:&lt;/strong&gt; An order book is described as an electronic list of buy &amp;amp; sell orders that are executed in an organized manner in terms of price level. Order books are used by most of the cryptocurrency exchanges. The common buy and sell data will appear on the top &amp;amp; bottom, or in some cases, it will be displayed on the left and right side of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ads-based exchange:&lt;/strong&gt; Ads-based exchange acts as an extended branch of P2P(peer-to-peer) cryptocurrency exchange. Here, the buyer and seller are matched by the integrated software based on the requirements. Any buyer/seller wishing to carry out trading using ads-based crypto exchange is required to select the desired price range and proceed with buying/selling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OTC:&lt;/strong&gt; Crypto OTC(over-the-counter) is the process of trading crypto assets directly between two involved parties. This type of trading came into effect in order to avoid any sort of slippage. OTC is a conventional trade happening between two parties where one of them usually being a trading desk. OTC trading deals in huge transaction volume when compared with other exchanges. Any potential exchange related risks can be minimized while executing through an experienced trading desk. Through dealing in large volumes, liquidity can be highly fragmented over the crypto exchanges. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering the above-mentioned cryptocurrency exchange types, the order book is the most common. This is because this type of exchange already exists in the conventional stock exchanges. However, over-the-counter and ads based exchanges, primarily are introduced after the advent of cryptocurrencies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#developing-types-of-cryptocurrency-exchange-softwares"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Developing types of cryptocurrency exchange softwares:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering the business requirements, you can build a cryptocurrency exchange through two basic ways viz., building cryptocurrency exchange from scratch and using white label cryptocurrency exchange software. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crypto exchange from scratch:&lt;/strong&gt; Creating a cryptocurrency exchange from scratch will aid the entrepreneur in implementing the fundamental idea. Developing cryptocurrency exchange from scratch will enable you to fix the functionalities as per you desire, but there is a catch. The main hardship in starting a cryptocurrency exchange from scratch is that you should have a clear cut route for developing since every single feature is entirely based on your choice. Even though developing from scratch will consume a considerable amount of time and money, you can get your desired output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;White label cryptocurrency exchange development:&lt;/strong&gt; A white label cryptocurrency exchange software or clone script is a ready-made, prefabricated crypto exchange script that consists of primary trading features and security attributes that is needed for a crypto exchange. You do not need to be technically well versed to start a cryptocurrency exchange using white label cryptocurrency exchange software. The mere adoption of the script for getting your desired output is more than enough to start a cryptocurrency exchange using white label cryptocurrency exchange software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the business requirements of the entrepreneurs or startups, they can build a cryptocurrency exchange from scratch or use white label cryptocurrency exchange software. Taking the above mentioned points in account, the common type preferred by most entrepreneurs is the development of white label cryptocurrency exchange software. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-white-label-cryptocurrency-exchange-software-is-preferred-to-scratch"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Why white label cryptocurrency exchange software is preferred to scratch?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing cryptocurrency exchange using white label cryptocurrency exchange software, compared with other methods is regarded as highly beneficial for several reasons. The speciality of the white label cryptocurrency exchange software is that it has a special language script and design that is void of any type of plagiarism. The white label cryptocurrency exchange software is more often than not compared with clone scripts due the availability of customization techniques. Some of the mentionable features of using a white label cryptocurrency exchange software is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time:&lt;/strong&gt; We are living in a space where time is considered precious and no one could dare to lose it lethargically. In that regard, the time required to start any fresh business is very crucial to carry on with the momentum. Starting a cryptocurrency exchange is no exception. Integrating a white label cryptocurrency exchange software for commencing your cryptocurrency exchange saves a considerable amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost:&lt;/strong&gt; Money is a major factor that plays a telling role in starting any new business. The cost for starting a cryptocurrency exchange from scratch will require a substantial amount of financial support, whereas using a white label crypto exchange software does not need a sound financial backing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Built-in features:&lt;/strong&gt; Incorporating a white label crypto exchange software comes with a lot of built-in features. The same might be available with developing from scratch, but it will cost a fortune to bring out the desired features. Having all the exclusive features in a cost-effective manner will serve as a huge boost for any new business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Test run:&lt;/strong&gt; Any software that is built for a purpose requires extensive testing before it hits the ground running. Creating a cryptocurrency exchange from scratch won’t have sufficient space for conducting test runs. On the other hand, starting a crypto exchange using white label cryptocurrency exchange software is an exception to that fact. This is mainly because a white label software would undergo several testing phases before it can be cleared for complete implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these mentioned features, the quality that involves creation as well as adoption is a crucial factor to consider. Any business module requires a degree of quality while implementing those in real time and being a volatile aspect, crypto related business requires a high degree of quality to gain user prominence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-choose-a-reliable-cryptocurrency-exchange-software-development-company"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;How to choose a reliable cryptocurrency exchange software development company?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than developing a cryptocurrency exchange software, getting a quality white label cryptocurrency exchange software is very important. This is because, once a crypto exchange is created, any kind of alteration is considerably difficult to implement. This situation applies to more or less every business sector. Due to the presence of numerous features, it is vital to have a top-notch script in order to taste success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, the current cryptocurrency market is filled with countless developers across the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Therefore, finding a completely reliable white label cryptocurrency exchange software development company is a tedious process. In order to get your desired output, it is highly advisable to approach the best &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.zabtechnologies.net/cryptocurrency-exchange-software-development-company?utm_campaign=sanblog5&amp;amp;utm_medium=mathew&amp;amp;utm_source=dev"&gt;white label cryptocurrency exchange software development company&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in the crypto ecosystem. You can pick out the best through conducting extensive market research and thorough analysis of the current market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#wrapping-up"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Wrapping up:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The financial sector took a grand detour upon the arrival of cryptocurrencies. This is mainly due to the ease with which cryptocurrencies can be facilitated across the globe. This is the same factor behind the involvement of cryptocurrencies into business sectors. Talking about the businesses powered by cryptocurrencies, starting a cryptocurrency exchange is one of the most profitable business modules in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like any other businesses, there are numerous ways to commence your cryptocurrency exchange. Among the already established methods, starting a cryptocurrency exchange using white label crypto exchange software is more ideal for startups and budding entrepreneurs. Since, this is a booming business, considering the well-being of startups is more crucial for any future enhancement of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Number one question on every PHP interview </title>
      <author>Damian Brdej</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 10:40:27 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/quentindamianino/number-one-question-on-every-php-interview-2na2</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/quentindamianino/number-one-question-on-every-php-interview-2na2</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a PHP programmer and have been on many job interviews. I noticed that on each of them one question always came up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That question is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's the difference between abstract class and interface?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer to this question is simple and proves the candidate's familiarity with object-oriented programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let's compare these two:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#abstract-class"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Abstract class
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can provide some functionality and leave the rest for the derived class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The derived class may or may not override the concrete functions defined in the base class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A child class extended from an abstract class should logically be related.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To declare class to be abstract just simply &lt;code&gt;abstract&lt;/code&gt; before &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; keyword&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#interface"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Interface
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It cannot contain any functionality. It only contains definitions of the methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The derived class MUST provide code for all the methods defined in the interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Completely different and non-related classes can be logically grouped together using an interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To declare interface use &lt;code&gt;interface&lt;/code&gt; keyword&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;interface Template
{
    public function setVariable($name, $var);
    public function getHtml($template);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Node.js vs PHP: Which is better for backend development?</title>
      <author>indumathysk</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 10:25:57 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/hireindianprogrammers/nodejs-vs-php-which-is-better-for-backend-development-4p4n</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/hireindianprogrammers/nodejs-vs-php-which-is-better-for-backend-development-4p4n</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are many facets of web development that are constantly evolving. Likewise, the app development and programming communities have to contend with a constant influx of new technologies and tools. In their minds, the two types of solutions are not distinct: the long-term and mature and the latest and upcoming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programmers dealing with backends usually have to choose between PHP vs Node.js. Both these languages are used to create unique websites. In addition, people use PHP to develop server-side applications and Javascript for constructing front-end applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Popular sites that use Node.js include Twitter, Spotify, Medium, Trello, etc., and sites that use PHP are Facebook, Wikipedia, WordPress, Instagram, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market share of PHP stands at 45.43%, and Node.js stands at 4.24%, according to a report by SimilarTech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, why did everything suddenly change? What changed? Backend programmers shifted their attention from traditional PHP to JS, which took the form of an all-new Node.js.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importance Of The Right Backend Technology&lt;br&gt;
A web page features technology from both sides: the client-side and the server. These include a backend language, a database, and a server that is invisible to users. As the most widely used server-side technologies, both Node.js and PHP run the internet, and both are capable of running applications of any complexity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, choosing the correct backend technology is critical for a project. Conversely, a wrong choice can spell disaster for any business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially for small businesses, selecting the right technology can seem overwhelming because a wrong decision will have more significant consequences for a small company that often has limited resources. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here in this article, we compare both PHP vs Node.js in greater detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Brief Overview Of Node.js&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
JavaScript V8 Engine in Chrome is the foundation for Node.js backend development, a cross-platform and open-source javascript runtime environment. It was developed by Ryan Dahl, an American software engineer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Node.js is relatively new, Microsoft, Yahoo, LinkedIn, and PayPal are among the companies that already use Node.js. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As per a report, 1.6% of all websites known to web use Node.js. It allows the developers to leverage asynchronous programming, which is the primary advantage of Node.js. Developers no longer need to wait for functions and procedures to run. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no linear or line-by-line execution of the code, and it is executed all at once.  Another great advantage is that multiple databases are supported by Node.js backend development. That is why people are saying that Node.Js is the future of web development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When To Use Node.js&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
To achieve the best app performance, we will determine when to use Node.js. Also, now that you have an overview of Node.js, let’s look at some examples illustrating when to use Node.js’ on the practical level. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real-time Application&lt;br&gt;
IoT Applications&lt;br&gt;
Data Streaming Applications&lt;br&gt;
Chat Application&lt;br&gt;
Single-page Application&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages Of Node.js&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Node.js has many advantages, but the below mentioned are the prominent ones:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Node.js Offers Easy Scalability&lt;br&gt;
Node.js is built to scale; also, it’s an excellent choice to use Node.js for microservices architecture because it’s a lightweight technology tool. Small app developers use it to build light, fast, real-time systems that can be scaled up later or easily added on to existing systems. There is no limit to the heights you can reach with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Easy To Learn&lt;br&gt;
Node.js programming is relatively intuitive once you are proficient in JavaScript and Object-Oriented Programming. Also, to be successful with Node’s asynchronous flow, you have to have a clear understanding of the client-server model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this, it becomes effortless for them when they choose to use Node.js for the backend. In addition, the high adaptation rate reduces overall development time since the development rate is high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Node.js – A Single Programming Language&lt;br&gt;
Node.js is a programming language that you can use to power back-end applications developed with JavaScript. Also, JavaScript is used on the front end and the back end, and you can use the same language for both ends of the website, resulting in better productivity. In addition to its simplicity, Node.js allows you to create web applications compatible with nearly every web browser because it supports JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Benefit Of Fullstack Js&lt;br&gt;
JavaScript was used exclusively on the client-side before Node.js. At the same time, server-side development was then handled by a different language. As a result, backend and frontend developers have to be hired separately in practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full-stack JavaScript became possible due to the popularity of Node.js. These days, web applications can be implemented in the front-end and back-end with JavaScript, allowing much more efficient app deployments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast Solution&lt;br&gt;
The response time in the middle of testing can be significant, as it determines how well the startup will perform in the long run. Node.js provides a quick response time for developers, thus providing a much-needed benefit. Also, Node.js lightweight technology comes with a set of tools that speeds up the development process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enhanced Flexibility&lt;br&gt;
Technology such as Node.js is highly flexible, so the requirements of a business or project can be met by customizing it. Moreover, web developers can create client-server communication by combining JSON and Node.js. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to its support for JSON formats, Node.js is a highly flexible framework. JSON is an API that can communicate with apps, clients, and servers across the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Known For Offering High Performance
To understand how Node.js accomplishes this, it is vital to know how the underlying technology works. Software development calls for smooth operations, and Node.js makes that possible. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Node.js to function appropriately, Google’s V8 JavaScript engine is needed as JavaScript engines compile directly to machine code. Thus, when the code is compiled directly into machine code, it runs faster and better. Also, due to non-blocking I/O operations provided by the runtime environment, executing the code is made considerably faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Advantage Of Caching
The Node.js runtime environment has a caching module among its many features. Also, it is possible to optimize Node.js by using caching services. An application memory cache stores the first module request made when a request is made. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, developers don’t have to execute their code as often as site loads by the caching module respond instantly to users. Using this method, you can let your users view your web pages within a fraction of a second, so they will not have to wait too long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offers The Freedom To Develop Apps&lt;br&gt;
Node.js offers more freedom and room to do things your way than other programming languages. This language is incredibly flexible so that you can customize every element completely. It allows you to add features with fewer restrictions from a fresh install, but it can only execute basic tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real-Time Communication &lt;br&gt;
When it comes to data-intensive, real-time apps and IoT devices, Node.js is considered the most suitable technology because it is both scalable and quick at the same time. Therefore, IoT apps and real-time apps using this technology are perfect for IoT devices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applications such as forums, social networks, stock exchange software, and advertising servers can be connected to node.js constantly via two-way connections. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantages Of Node.js&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Node.js isn’t picture-perfect. Here we have mentioned a few weak points you can look out for when choosing Node.js:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Application Programming Interface (API) Is Not Stable&lt;br&gt;
Node.js has a significant disadvantage because the API frequently changes, resulting in backward incompatibility. The incompatibility leads to its instability, which leads to heavy code changes. To sync with the latest Node.js API version, they constantly have to change the access code. Additionally, constant changes in codes are needed to keep up with the newest version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lacks a robust library support system&lt;br&gt;
If Node.js is used to create a web application, monitoring becomes complex. This is only because Node.js has several registrations and libraries of poor quality or incomplete and inadequately documented. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the extensive libraries and modules available, it is open-source, resulting in low coding standards. Therefore, you can only succeed in your project if you hire well-qualified and experienced experts with reputable expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Brief Overview Of PHP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
PHP stands for Hypertext Preprocessor. Rasmus Lerdorf developed it in 1995. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A PHP application runs on a web server and does not rely on the online browser. It uses the same syntax as that of a C programming language. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PHP is a favorite amongst newbies and established developers worldwide for various reasons, including its range of functionalities, a fantastic array of add-ins to extend functionality, and a unique online community, which directly contributes to its popularity. According to a report by Statista, PHP is the 11th most practiced programming language worldwide as of 2021. Even it is very important for PHP developers to take their roles and responsibilities seriously for developing any applications. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When To Use PHP?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
All domains use PHP to develop web applications and other software. Below we have mentioned a few areas where you should use PHP for development by hiring the best PHP developers:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Image processing&lt;br&gt;
Representation and data analytics&lt;br&gt;
E-commerce applications and websites&lt;br&gt;
Content Management System&lt;br&gt;
UI/UX based Applications&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages Of PHP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Among PHP’s many advantages are its performance, stability, and user-friendliness, which have led to its popularity. In the following list, we discuss the benefits of PHP in more detail:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quick Unit Testing&lt;br&gt;
It is easy to test PHP-based web applications. Its quick testing feature is an easy way to test PHP backend development. This feature also helps the programmers with writing test cases and facilitates smooth testing. Furthermore, PHP-based web applications do not require additional code written by the developers as many of the tasks can be automated using PHP frameworks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Platform Independent&lt;br&gt;
Almost all operating systems are supported by PHP, including Windows, Unix, and Linux. Therefore, you can use PHP to develop web applications on any operating system. Furthermore, with PHP, integration with other programming languages and databases is easy, and also there is no need to rewrite the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintenance&lt;br&gt;
Frameworks like PHP help in developing web applications, and also maintaining the code is much easier. PHP framework’s model view controller architecture simplifies the maintenance and use of code. In addition, it helps separate files for different modules according to the MVC architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stability&lt;br&gt;
In addition to its user-friendly features, the PHP backend development is also very stable. Since PHP was developed, it has grown in popularity. Its goal is to make it easier for programmers to build PHP-based web applications. During the time they have been using PHP, they have fixed many of the issues and bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher Loading Speed&lt;br&gt;
Compared with other programming languages, PHP is fast. Therefore, slow internet and data speeds are no problem for PHP applications. However, it takes a long time for other applications to connect to the database and download the data after queries are made. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less Coding &lt;br&gt;
Programmers can keep the source code of web applications clean and maintainable with the code generation tools provided by specific PHP frameworks. This makes it easy for PHP programmers to add features or functionality to a website without writing lengthy and complex codes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;User-Friendly&lt;br&gt;
The PHP language is easy to learn in application development, especially for developers with C programming experience. However, among all the programming languages available to developers, PHP is only the first choice if you are trying to build dynamic, complex, and user-friendly web applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Built-In Database Connection&lt;br&gt;
Connecting multiple built-in databases directly reduces the time and trouble needed to develop web applications and content-based sites altogether. There are a variety of widely used relational databases that PHP developers can use. Frameworks that provide object-relational mapping systems further simplify database operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Library Support&lt;br&gt;
Utilizing PHP has another advantage of providing functional modules. Different available modules are essential for helping to simplify your work. Since the modules have already been developed, you don’t need to create them from scratch. Including the module and maybe making a few modifications is all that will be required. PHP includes a variety of modules, including Graphics and PDF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantages Of PHP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Despite PHP’s usefulness, the language also has several drawbacks that limit its dominance in that field. These are the drawbacks that we examined to get a clearer picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security Issues&lt;br&gt;
PHP-based products continue to raise security concerns due to several reasons over the years. First, its open-source nature ensures that once a vulnerability is found, it becomes common knowledge. These vulnerabilities can therefore be exploited by any programmer with malicious intent and adequate skills. And it can only be fixed when the bug is removed in a new version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t Allow Change Or Modification&lt;br&gt;
Frameworks for PHP provide a base structure for developing web applications and a way to build custom applications. Although developers do not have any control over the core behavior of these frameworks, they still lack any option to modify them. In this way, you cannot change the core behavior of a web application in PHP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difference Between Node.js And PHP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
PHP and Node.js provide robust, dynamic, and efficient server-side development platforms, which have become competitors because of their powerful features. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the two scripting languages compete with each other, there are also some differences between them. Listed are some examples of some of the differences. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Runtime Environment
JS languages are run on a server with Node.js, designed to run externally in a browser. Web browsers with such capabilities can perform functions on the client-side without requiring any platform-specific components. In addition, it allows developers to use JavaScript beyond the browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PHP scripting language is used to write web pages. The webserver module of the Zend engine could be used with an interpreter to run it in a browser. The PHP programming language was designed to deliver web content to browsers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modules
Node.js supporters complain that PHP projects are more stable than Node.js projects. With the npm-audit initiative, the Node.js package registry aims to provide more control over its packages. This enables you to check for malicious code in each box. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the PHP programming language has been dominant in this area for many years. There have been recent complaints from some PHP loyalists that they don’t receive good projects. Since PHP is capable of being imported on other platforms, they have migrated to other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scalability
Upon comparing Node.js vs PHP scalability, both technologies prove to be scalable. It’s possible to build large scalable applications with either PHP or Node.js. Yet, there are some critical differences in how efficiently you can create scalable applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of e-commerce and blogs, PHP is often a go-to tool for building web applications where most content management systems are supported. The Node.js framework, on the other hand, can be used to create dynamic, scalable solutions geared towards handling numerous I/O operations. Additionally, you can scale Node.js on multi-core systems, but this may require more work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance
Code performance is measured by how well PHP or Node.js code is written, how quickly pages load, and how seamless the application performs. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its asynchronous nature and its JavaScript V8 engine make Node.js extremely fast and remarkably fast at executing code. However, the event-driven nature of Node.js prevents it from blocking existing requests from being completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PHP performance on page-load time efficiency shows that it was developed much earlier. This results in slow loading and no chance for concurrency since the process is blocked until it’s fully calculated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DataBase
It’s much easier to understand how disparate data points are related when using relational databases because data is stored in tables. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Databases stored in NoSQL databases can include almost any data structure, including structured, semistructured, and unstructured. NoSQL databases are therefore the best choice for developers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Node.js has grown in tandem with the NoSQL database revolution, which means it is compatible with various databases. Databases like MongoDB and CouchDB are compatible with Node.js.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While PHP works on traditional databases like MySQL and MariaDB, you can access NoSQL databases with library import, but it is a complicated process that takes time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frameworks
The most common components of your project are already provided in the form of libraries, functions, and APIs by frameworks. Therefore, it takes you less time to write redundant code using an extensive framework. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Node.js’s libraries have seen massive growth in a relatively short period due to frameworks like Meteor and Sails. As a result, the number of frameworks is much higher, allowing for faster development by reducing resource consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, PHP frameworks have been around since 1995 with hundreds of niche markets. Laravel, CakePHP, and Phalcon are some of the most commonly used frameworks by many programmers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to Choose:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://hireindianprogrammers.com/nodejs-vs-php/"&gt;Node.js or PHP for Backend Development?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
To compare Node.js vs PHP, it is impossible to determine which is better. Rather than choosing a technology based on features alone, you should first assess the project’s requirements and then select the one that fits them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, the prominent companies that utilize Node.js include  Netflix, Paypal, NASA, Trello, etc. These companies decided to move to Node.js for its features like real-time open connection, speedy delivery, and reduced development time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if you have an app that needs frequent updates, Node.js would be a good choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies like Facebook, Wikipedia, MailChimp, WordPress, etc., utilize PHP for their app development. These companies have been using PHP for quite some time now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They use PHP to create full-fledged static HTML websites to improve the development process and save time making a source code each time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is essential to remember the best thing about both of them is that the best experts create them in the field to develop web and mobile applications more effectively and efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, when selecting a technology, your task should determine which one will best satisfy your project requirements. Then, with an understanding of your business logic and project goals, you can select the most suitable technology platform for your project.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Test Orchestration: What, Why, and How</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the agile development methodology, the velocity of testing holds the key to delivering the best quality software within the stipulated budget and time constraints. As such, this drives the need to automate the testing process. Most software development teams visualize test automation as a discreet step in the delivery lifecycle instead of viewing it as a designed sequence of steps. There are various aspects of testing through which software needs to pass, such as unit testing, functional testing, integration testing, smoke testing, performance testing, and more. Each of these needs to be automated in order to achieve certainty of software behavior and reduce the time to test. However, simply automating the tests is not enough to achieve the desired levels of quality and reduction in the time and cost to get there. This is where test orchestration plays an essential role.&lt;br&gt;

      <title>The Arrow Function in JS!</title>
      <author>Ustariz Enzo</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 10:14:06 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/ziratsu/the-arrow-function-in-js-528f</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/ziratsu/the-arrow-function-in-js-528f</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey &lt;strong&gt;fellow creators&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;arrow function&lt;/em&gt; exists since 2015 and is quite different from the classic functions. Let’s see how !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you prefer to watch the video &lt;strong&gt;version&lt;/strong&gt;, it's right here :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O6lMYOT6XLs"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-how-to-use-an-arrow-function"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. How to use an arrow function.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the basic syntax, we don't need the "function" keyword and we put it by default in a constant, that way we won't have hoisting issues.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you have just a return, you can use the short version.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you have one parameter (but only one), you can remove the parenthesis which would make it even more concise:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s very useful when you use it with some higher order function like the &lt;em&gt;map.()&lt;/em&gt; method:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;multiplied&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-the-difference-between-a-classic-function-and-an-arrow-function"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. The difference between a classic function and an arrow function.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main difference between the classic and arrow function is the value of "this".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use a classic function as the value of a property in an object, "this" will refer to the calling context, i.e. the obj where the function is defined :&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// {a: 5, foo: ƒ}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, if you use an arrow function, "this" will return the global object.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Window Object&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In that case, this will refer to the parent of the calling context, thus the global object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of refering the direct context, it will refer to the parent of that context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to keep that difference in mind when you are dealing with functions and the "this" keyword.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come and take a look at my &lt;strong&gt;Youtube channel&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Learntocreate/videos"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/c/Learntocreate/videos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enzo. &lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/jhonthsmith/5-tips-mobile-app-changing-the-future-of-transport-industry-in-2022-178d</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now days transport genuinely influence will be completely digitalized technologies till 2022. Several transport also worked with mobile app devices like uber,ola,bike,mini car, auto etc also. As the mobile devices worked upon both experience costumers and drivers. Versatile &lt;a href="https://www.franticpro.com/mobile-app-development/"&gt;mobile application development&lt;/a&gt; improvement assisted with giving all the web network inclusion all the transportation things including transport, metro, cable car train and plane.In 2022 upcoming future transport fully comes with mobile technology and it will be good impact on transportation management and set the more traffic in travel websites. Mostly transportation do the offline work in previous generation as technology being upgrade nowdays all the industry work online and digitalized that is the work also will be easily and smart. Mobile app services helps to all industry to work with the technology and making the more fun and enjoy the work.&lt;br&gt;
Mapping the benefits of mobile technology in transportation&lt;br&gt;
This time in the world presence the lot’s of transportation solution available.&lt;br&gt;
Individuals think that it is hard to browse those choices that best satisfy their movement requests.&lt;br&gt;
Carpooling, ride-sharing, private booking, and so on are just a portion of the transportation prospects.&lt;br&gt;
Quick advancement in computerized innovation and programming improvement has brought the world into the mechanical domain.&lt;br&gt;
Also, with the warm hug of 4G, 5G, and Wi-Fi networks internationally, our reliance on the web has increased.&lt;br&gt;
The mobile technology amazing impact on transport management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Expanded effectiveness: If we talking about money, so then mobile technology is the cost expanded effectiveness  for the transportation, and it is trustworthy also&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Simple and Quick Payments: You can do simple and quick payments the the mobile technology and it will be secure payment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Better Customer Experience: Better Customer Experience is also matter because sometimes you get the fake costumer and that can impact on your businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Less Paperwork: In the &lt;a href="https://www.franticpro.com/mobile-app-development/"&gt;mobile technology&lt;/a&gt; you will be free from the paper work as well. That will be online process only. Mostly mobile app work with the online process and easy work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Further developed Security: Yes Further security also does matter, mobile app give the better security and restore the backups of your data and can recover the data if you have lost it.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>What Is Event-Driven Machine Learning?</title>
      <author>RudderStack</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 09:34:43 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/rudderstack/what-is-event-driven-machine-learning-5ed0</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/rudderstack/what-is-event-driven-machine-learning-5ed0</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Machine learning algorithms will build a model based on sample data to decide or predict without being explicitly programmed. This sample is also known as training data, and it's the key to any precise analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highly modern technology is mostly used in healthcare, where diagnostics are predicted for doctors' reviews. The sentiment analysis that tech giants are doing on social media is another interesting way to apply machine learning, fraud detection in the finance sector, and predicting customer churn in eCommerce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buckle up, and let's dive deeper into the essence of machine learning, its overall impact on technology and businesses, and its core industry applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#better-software-with-machine-learning"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Better Software With Machine Learning
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The possibility of machine learning has introduced new encouraging abilities in the software engineering world. All types of software applications are personal assistants trained to answer predetermined questions such as &lt;em&gt;Will these types of customers purchase that kind of products? *Earlier, the only way to build software was to code human-defined rules for a specific application whose purpose was to answer those particular questions. Back in those *ancient&lt;/em&gt; times, the human operator had to tell the software how to calculate the probability of a specific customer purchasing a certain product!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, instead of giving the software a specific command on doing a certain calculation, we can now provide precedents from the past using machine learning. Now, the software can make thorough data analysis and come up with its own rules. This entire process is what we now call "learning."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data is the most crucial element in the process of machine learning. The overall data quality will decide the software-defined rules and their quality. If the required information is not met, the software will not find the correct answers. Answering the question about getting the most data is the key to leveraging the power of machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#eventdriven-data-collection"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Event-Driven Data Collection
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial and essential step in any data science project is data collection. There are numerous ways when it comes to collecting data - from one or many sources. Sometimes it is hard to have direct entry to essential but sensitive information when working with enterprises. Many times, data scientists need to request data dumps. This implementation may prevent accidents, but it separates ongoing projects and enterprise reality. It averts teams from having real-time data access. It also requires activating various bureaucratic-based processes that will further cause additional work. This can be fixed with event-driven data collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data scientists can recreate brand new and real-time data by just listening to events emitted by the enterprise systems. Moreover, a data scientist can process the data with no risks of altering the enterprise data whatsoever. The enterprise system can also anonymize any kind of sensitive information or filter it. However, there is one requirement for the enterprise system: to adopt an event sourcing or event-driven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#eventdriven-data-exploration"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Event-Driven Data Exploration
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data scientists need to pre-process and filter the correct information to produce the most accurate answers. Data exploration is crucial to finding the correct combination of transformations to deliver the optimal data for the machine learning model. Thanks to a huge variety of data visualization tools, understanding data through visual representation helps us grasp its underlying connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, events are essentials to master data!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of events will assist data scientists in putting all data into context. The reason for any data modification cannot be discovered if there are limits to the exploration process, which should be applied to the mutable data. The updated data cannot be explored without calculating the previous value. All supplementary information events will provide patterns, habits, and highlight behavior, among other things. More qualitative data can be achieved by increasing machine learning capabilities. The enhancement of these capabilities can be further achieved with the overall process of event-driven data exploration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#eventdriven-data-preparation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Event-Driven Data Preparation
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a product is developed, data scientists don't design it for data machines but for humans. A machine cannot understand something like literature, but the human brain can process it as easily as focused reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a human brain will have difficulty calculating massive matrix operations, while the machine will do it with ease. This tells us that machines cannot compute abstract data, but this field is humans' expertise. To optimize machine learning, scientists need to convert this human-centric data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data preparation will pre-process, specialize, and clean data for each ML model. Since each model will be set to answer questions different from one another, the data coming from a single model won't fit another's requirements. The event-driven data technique can dramatically shorten the otherwise arduous task by incrementally producing specific data in a way that will process incoming events in continuity, making it a very valuable tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#summary"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While machine learning is nothing new, not all current companies have the potential to store exponential data volumes and use it adequately in equipping soon-to-be learning machines. In other words, not being able to enforce machine learning properly will prevent many, and especially smaller enterprises, from acquiring a favorable business outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In due time, and as technology continues to evolve, the models based on which machine learning now operates are expected to be facilitated and made available for all-size enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest hope researchers have in terms of sophistication of machine learning in the foreseeable future lies in making current models far more flexible and applicable. This will ultimately train respective machines to handle more than one task at a time - all by learning faster, smarter, and better.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to use spot instances during the Christmas frenzy?</title>
      <author>CAST AI</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/castai/how-to-use-spot-instances-during-the-christmas-frenzy-5c0f</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ve been doing a great job using spot instances for the entire year. But as 2021 is coming to a close, you might have noticed that there’s less inventory of your favorite instance types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even when you manage to get your hands on some, &lt;strong&gt;they get reclaimed rather quickly&lt;/strong&gt;. Everyone else needs extra capacity during the holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you even trust spot instances to reduce your costs at such a critical time?&lt;/strong&gt; Should you run everything on on-demand instances and pay the premium just to keep the application running? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are the questions we will answer in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jump to the section that’s most relevant to you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#dealingwithspotinstanceinterruptions"&gt;Dealing with spot instance interruptions manually is hard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#andwhatifyouhandledspotinstancesautomatically"&gt;And what if you handled the spot interruptions automatically?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#automationtakesmanytasksoffyourplate"&gt;Automation takes many tasks off your plate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#hereshowspotinstanceautomationworks"&gt;Here’s how spot instance automation works in practice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#theresultsmaysurpriseyou"&gt;The results may surprise you&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="dealingwithspotinstanceinterruptions"&gt;Dealing with spot instance interruptions manually is hard&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hyperscalers like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure have massive data centers scattered around the globe. At some point, they find themselves with spare capacity and they offer it at a discounted price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only catch is that the vendor can pull the plug at any time. This makes spot instances generally difficult to manage for production workloads. When getting a spot instance, you have no guarantee on how long it will stay available.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vendors only share some historical data about past interruptions to help you make a more informed decision. Or notify you when the risk of interruption increases for the instance you’re using to give you some extra time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spot instance is reclaimed with short notice - from 2 minutes to as little as 30 seconds. &lt;strong&gt;Is that enough time to drop everything and find a replacement for your instance? &lt;/strong&gt;You may know a superhuman engineer who’s able to do that, but they surely have more productive tasks to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spinning up a new instance takes time &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even if you identify the virtual machine where to move your workload, creating a new one takes time, so you’re still facing the danger of potential downtime. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Running paused machines means extra costs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you could have some paused machines at your disposal that could step in if you happen to lose a spot instance. But this comes at an additional price, and aren’t you in the spot business to save on your cloud costs? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spot instance availability changes rapidly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another issue is that the available capacity sold as spot instances can differ a lot based on size, region, time of day, and many other factors - all subject to frequent changes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The availability of an instance is based on supply and demand. So if you pick the most popular instance types and a market surge like Black Friday occurs, prepare for a nasty surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="andwhatifyouhandledspotinstancesautomatically"&gt;And what if you handled the spot interruptions automatically?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using an automation platform addresses all the problems listed above and makes all the difference when it comes to your cloud bill. You can rely on spot instances even during the most intense times of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At CAST AI, we have the &lt;strong&gt;Spot Fallback feature that keeps your workloads running even if the cloud provider sells all the capacity and there are no spot instances left for you to use&lt;/strong&gt;. If no spot instances matching your requirements are available, the autoscaler temporarily adds an on-demand node for your spot-only workloads so they have a place to run on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the inventory of Spot/Preemptible instances is available again, the autoscaler replaces the on-demand nodes used during the fallback with actual spot instances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That way you can still get the benefits of spot instances without having to be anxious about the potential downtime.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5IH2fgwS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cast.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Spot-Fallback-GIF.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5IH2fgwS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cast.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Spot-Fallback-GIF.gif" alt="spot instances" width="600" height="314"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="automationtakesmanytasksoffyourplate"&gt;Automation takes many tasks off your plate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But arguably the best part is that you don’t need to care about provisioning instances. Moving a workload from one spot instance to another is challenging if you do it manually because it’s a multi-step process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Examine the cloud provider offer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check the less popular instances - they're less likely to be interrupted and can run for longer periods of time. Before deciding to buy an instance, look at how often it is interrupted (its interruption or eviction rate).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Make your bid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set the maximum price you want to spend for your preferred spot instance. The rule of thumb is to follow the level of on-demand pricing and avoid getting interrupted when the price of that instance spikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Manage spot instances in groups&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This opens the doors to request a variety of instance types at the same time and increases your chances of securing a spot instance. You can get more tips about managing spot instances here: &lt;a href="https://cast.ai/blog/how-to-reduce-cloud-costs-by-90-spot-instances-and-how-to-use-them/" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Spot instances: How to reduce AWS, Azure, and GCP costs by 90%&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make spot instances work and secure the right mix of instances, you’ll have to dedicate a lot of time and effort to configuration, setup, and maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good automation platform will do them all for you. All you need to do is set up the right policies and see your workloads gracefully moved from one instance to another when interruption happens. Here’s how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="hereshowspotinstanceautomationworks"&gt;Here’s how spot instance automation works in practice &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CAST AI is an automation platform that uses a mix of tactics to optimize cloud costs and help teams get the performance they need. This approach extends to how spot instances are automated in CAST AI. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The platform doesn’t stick to a predefined list of instance types, but instead scans workloads for spot suitability and matches their requirements automatically. You can edit the list of spot-suitable workloads afterwards. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This flow is a lot faster than selecting the instance types you prefer manually and picking the pods which shouldn’t run on spot instances at all. The AI checks it all for you in minutes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the times when everyone is competing for spot instances they know and use, you will be playing in a mostly empty playground of ALL instance types suitable for your application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Configuring the automation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can automate spot instances on Kubernetes workloads running on EKS, Kops, AKS, and GKE. Here’s a short overview of how you can configure CAST AI to cover all the scenarios your application might face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tolerations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This configuration comes in handy when spot instances are an optional choice for your workload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When your pod is marked only with tolerations, the Kubernetes scheduler can place the pod on both spot and regular nodes, always picking the most cost-effective resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Node Selectors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this configuration, workloads will only use spot instances. The autoscaling mechanism will pick a spot instance whenever your pod requires an additional workload in the cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Node Affinity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we use spot instances if they’re available - if not, the application falls back to on-demand instances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if a spot instance gets interrupted and the on-demand instances in the cluster have some available capacity, pods that previously ran on that spot instance will be scheduled on the available on-demand resources. Moving your workloads back to spot instances is possible via the Rebalancer feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spot Reliability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This configuration focuses on minimizing the chance of workload interruptions. The autoscaler identifies which instance types are less likely to be interrupted and you can set a default reliability value to be applied across the entire cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reliability value is measured by the percentage of reclaimed instances during the trailing month for this instance type. Click &lt;a href="https://docs.cast.ai/guides/spot/#tolerations"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more info.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can control the reliability value at a more granular level, per workload. For example, you can leave the most cost-efficient value globally and choose more stable instances for specific workloads. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="theresultsmaysurpriseyou"&gt;The results may surprise you&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6yeviT4A--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cast.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Optimize-CAST-AI.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6yeviT4A--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cast.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Optimize-CAST-AI.png" alt="" width="880" height="461"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, we decided to check whether we were really using the best instances available and were shocked to see this spot instance recommendation: the INF1 instance. Who would CAST AI pick that for us? It's essentially a supercomputer for high-performance ML inference that costs a lot if you buy it for on-demand pricing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funnily enough, the CAST AI platform didn’t go off rails. The INF1 spot instance was actually cheaper at that point in time than the typical instance we were getting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while everyone was manually competing for what they knew, we rented a Ferrari for the price of a Fiat just because automation looked at every single instance type that can do the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we were choosing instances manually, we’d never look into this category. Automation expanded our reach and got us this gem of an instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are ready to quit competing on the same level everyone’s on - let us know and we’ll happily show you around the CAST AI platform.&lt;/p&gt;
