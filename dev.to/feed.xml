      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-a-user-story"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is a user story?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, let's understand what stories are in agile. It is a short description that talks about the desired function from the perspective of the user. Agile teams size these in such a way that they can be completed in one iteration. These are the basic artifacts that eventually define the system behavior. Both business as well as tech stakeholders can understand the story's intent with ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are of two types: User stories and Enabler stories. The former delivers the functionality to the final user. The latter on the other hand brings more visibility into the building process. In this blog, we will be dealing with user stories, and splitting user stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand the difference between the two types of stories, let's take this example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User story (end user): As a commuter, I want to identify the nearest cab I can book so that I can travel to my destination faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enabler story: Use the device GPS and sync with nearby registered device GPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In agile, user stories are the most basic means of telling what is the needed functionality. They focus on the end user and are very customer-centric in nature. The subject of interest in a user story isn't the system, but rather the user. User stories also define the business value of the requirement at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, roughly, a user story would be written combining the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User Story = User role + Activity + Business Value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above example, the user role is that of the commuter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activity is identifying the nearest cab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The business value would then be the need to travel faster to the destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through this method of writing user stories, the dev teams understand these things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who would be using the product/ who they are building for&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What the user is doing with the feature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why are they building the product?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we know what user stories are, let's move on to understanding splitting user stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-does-splitting-user-stories-mean"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What does 'Splitting user stories' mean?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a user story is ready so that it can be scheduled for implementation, it should be 'small enough'. What this means is that the story should be such that the developers can complete it in one iteration. This is a general rule of thumb around user stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agile&lt;a href="https://buildd.co/product/invest-agile"&gt;INVEST&lt;/a&gt; acronym states the characteristics of a good user story and can be cited here. A quick refresher, this is what the acronym stands for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I - Independent&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;N - Negotiable&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;V - Valuable&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E - Estimable&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;S - Small&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;T - Testable&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is clear, the S-Small suggests that user stories are to be small in size. These allow faster implementation, and are also more reliable. This is because being small in size, they flow through the system with a less amount of risk and variability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it so happens that most user stories are complex in nature. They cannot be completed in one iteration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where user story splitting comes into play. As you might have already figured, splitting user stories means to split a bigger, more complex user story into a smaller one to complete it in one go. This process is also known as story splitting. Since a user story has three parts, the role + activity + business value, it's a must to keep these on splitting. So, story splitting is done such that each story has a measurable business value by itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, how is this done? Well, there is no one way for splitting user stories. The ways of doing this depend on the business domain and hence various authors have their own ideas on how to do it. In the coming sections we will touch upon some of the ways of splitting user stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eJVrFTbv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/RackMultipart20211126-4-2wiv03_html_1a1a24b74d9c3d41.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eJVrFTbv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/RackMultipart20211126-4-2wiv03_html_1a1a24b74d9c3d41.jpg" alt="" width="" height=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#agile-techniques-for-splitting-user-stories"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Agile Techniques for Splitting User Stories
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are some of the common ways of splitting user stories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-story-splitting-by-capabilities-offered"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Story splitting by capabilities offered
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this, you have to look at the capabilities being offered by each user story. For example, if a main user story needs you to search as well as sort, you can split these into two. You can also then further split these if you have multiple ways of sorting and searching in each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-based-on-the-devices-the-app-is-to-be-used-on"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Based on the devices the app is to be used on
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can't expect all the users using your software to use it on the exact same type of system. For this, you have to make accommodations for devices, settings, and other things. So, you can split user stories based on these differences and work on one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-splitting-based-on-user-roles"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Splitting based on user roles
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the same software would be used differently by different users. For example, consider a recruitment portal. The users would be using it in a different way than the HR managers. Same thing for educational software, teachers and students wouldn't be using it in the same way. Thus, you can define the different roles of people who would use the system. Through this, you can also split the features and work on them accordingly. In this way, it's easier to address the varied needs of each user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-splitting-user-stories-based-on-user-personas"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Splitting user stories based on user personas
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, after user roles, user personas also could differ. This would depend on a number of things. For example, if a person has a lot of knowledge about the system, they'd want shortcuts so that they can work faster. A newer user would need a lot of guidance on the system and you'd probably have to integrate a lot of tips or guides. Someone with a physical handicap would need to interact with the feature in a different way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on such differences in personas, you can split your user stories so that you are focusing on only one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-split-user-stories-by-workflows"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Split user stories by workflows
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One main feature can be divided into a number of smaller ones. Take, for instance, posting a photo on an app like Instagram. You'd first choose the picture from your gallery, or click one. Then, you might want to make some edits to the picture. Next, tagging people and adding a location and caption would come into play. After all these things only would you post the picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the example we've taken is bound to be more complex than this, but the basic idea is to split based on the flow. So each of these tasks can be worked on as a separate user story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-split-based-on-data-types"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. Split based on data types
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, we shall consider local ways of entering data all over the world. Suppose you are creating an app to track the amount of steps you take a day and the distance covered. In the USA, you'd have to show this data in miles. But, in India, you'd have to show the same data in kilometres. So, when making an app, you'd come across different ways of entering data. You can split user stories based on the data types accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#7-splitting-user-stories-by-the-crud-operations"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  7. Splitting user stories by the CRUD operations.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might know, CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete. You can split your user stories into smaller ones based on this. This way, a smaller user story would involve only dealing with the Creation of something. Another might deal only with the way users Read certain data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-spidr-method-for-splitting-user-stories"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The SPIDR method for splitting user stories
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SPIDR method is a relatively new way of splitting user stories. It stands for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;S - Spikes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P - Paths&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I - Interface&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D - Data&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R - Rules&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's understand how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spikes&lt;br&gt;
Spike is a method to make the development team more aware of the things they are doing. Technical unknowns tend to make a story large, so the team needs to learn before making user stories. Only after understanding the components in detail do they work on writing and splitting the user stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paths&lt;br&gt;
There could be multiple ways of carrying out a function. Say to pay online, you could use credit or debit card or some other way. User stories are then made to tackle each of these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interfaces&lt;br&gt;
This is similar to the point about devices mentioned earlier. You can split user stories based on the devices and interfaces users will be interacting through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data&lt;br&gt;
The data would be entered in different ways. Take for instance filling a form. Here, you could work on one story for collecting and storing basic user data such as name and location. Another story could then collect the picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rules&lt;br&gt;
User stories would have some restrictions to make it function well. So, you can split and add just one rule at a time in each user story. For example, the first user story would be open and have no restrictions and collect any sort of data. The next ones can add various restrictions on this data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Use react-hot-toast with Promise &amp; Axios</title>
      <author>MOHSIN ALI SOOMRO</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2021 06:55:44 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/mohsinalisoomro/use-react-hot-toast-with-promise-axios-2lmd</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/mohsinalisoomro/use-react-hot-toast-with-promise-axios-2lmd</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#promise"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Promise
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise"&gt;promise&lt;/a&gt; is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future : either a resolved value, or a reason that it's not resolved (e.g., a network error occurred). A promise may be in one of 3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected, or pending&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉 A promise can states&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;✅ fulfilled - The action relating to the promise succeeded&lt;br&gt;
❌ rejected - The action relating to the promise failed&lt;br&gt;
⚪ pending - Hasn't fulfilled or rejected yet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#axios"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Axios
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://axios-http.com/"&gt;Axios&lt;/a&gt; is a Javascript library used to make HTTP requests from node. js or XMLHttpRequests from the browser and it supports the Promise API that is native to JS ES6. It can be used intercept HTTP requests and responses and enables client-side protection against XSRF. It also has the ability to cancel requests&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#reacthottoast"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  react-hot-toast
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/timolins/react-hot-toast"&gt;Smoking hot Notifications for React&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Lightweight, customizable and beautiful by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React Code&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import axios, { AxiosResponse } from "axios";
import toast, { Toaster } from "react-hot-toast";
import { useEffect } from "react";
export default function App() {
  const fetchData = async (): Promise&amp;lt;AxiosResponse&amp;gt; =&amp;gt; {
    const response = await axios.get(
      "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users"
    );
    console.log({ response });
    return response;
  };
  toast.promise(fetchData(), {
    loading: "Process",
    error: "error occurs in data",
    success: "get data successfully...."
  });
  useEffect(() =&amp;gt; {
    fetchData();
  }, []);

  return (
    &amp;lt;div className="App"&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Hello CodeSandbox&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Start editing to see some magic happen!&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;Toaster /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
  );
}


&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>4 best python web app hosting services for free(with complete process)</title>
      <author>Yash Makan</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2021 06:43:07 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/yash_makan/4-best-python-web-app-hosting-services-for-freewith-complete-process-57nb</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/yash_makan/4-best-python-web-app-hosting-services-for-freewith-complete-process-57nb</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi developers, I am Yash Makan and in today's post, we are going to discuss 4 platforms where you can host your flask or Django app. If you've completed a website or API using python or planning to create one then this post is so right for you. Also, read till the end as in the end, I am going to explain step by step the complete process of uploading your web app to the internet. So without any further ado let's start!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--545USPNC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.giphy.com/media/dpsUFSR9ZHjwfrVAg9/giphy.webp" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--545USPNC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.giphy.com/media/dpsUFSR9ZHjwfrVAg9/giphy.webp" alt="https://i.giphy.com/media/dpsUFSR9ZHjwfrVAg9/giphy.webp" width="480" height="270"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-a-hosting-platform-and-why-do-i-need-one"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is a hosting platform and why do I need one?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright! If you have developed a web app then you might know that all these apps whether made with Django or flask run on localhost. A localhost is a place where you can run your code and view it in your browser. But when you complete the development of your web app then it might be time to publish your app on the internet so that anyone can access your websites. A web app setup locally can be viewed by you but your friends won't be able to see your amazing work. There are two options you can opt-in these situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One is to connect your localhost with a tunnel using ngrok. Ngrok exposes your localhost to the internet so that everyone can access it by a specific URL provided by it. I don't recommend this way if you want your website 24x7 as you have to run your program 24x7 which is quite not the case but if you just want to share your localhost for some time and you don't want the connection to be connected then you can choose this method. For more info, you can read it &lt;a href="https://dev.to/drsimplegraffiti/ngrok-expose-a-local-web-server-to-the-internet-4m67"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; by Abayomi Ogunnusi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second way is to host your code to someone else's server. This someone else server is what we call the hosting platform. Here these servers run your code 24x7 at some specific domain. So if you want to host then below are your best options according to me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--R9qVSFlO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media3.giphy.com/media/COAg7vjpWW8Ja/giphy.gif%3Fcid%3Decf05e47akugdyaqluoi5847vpgh9uw34nt71j11s3nxw8b4%26rid%3Dgiphy.gif%26ct%3Dg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--R9qVSFlO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media3.giphy.com/media/COAg7vjpWW8Ja/giphy.gif%3Fcid%3Decf05e47akugdyaqluoi5847vpgh9uw34nt71j11s3nxw8b4%26rid%3Dgiphy.gif%26ct%3Dg" alt="Trulli" width="245" height="199"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;bye-bye localhost
  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;✅ Git connect&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;✅ Custom domain&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;✅ CLI available&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;✅ deploy and manage multiple versions &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;✅ deploy ease&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;✅ HTTPS/SSL&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No Project limit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;32 deployments every 1 hour&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-qovery-%E2%86%97"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. qovery &lt;a href="https://www.qovery.com/"&gt;↗&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;✅ Git connect with auto-deploy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;✅ Great community support with discord&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;✅ HTTPS/SSL&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;✅ Inbuilt database integration like PostgreSQL, MySQL&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;✅ CLI available&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;up to 3 projects with 100 applications&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to my personal experience, it's a little tricky to deploy the web app on qovery&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;100 deployments a month&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-pythonanywhere-%E2%86%97"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. pythonanywhere &lt;a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/"&gt;↗&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;✅ Git connect&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;✅ deploy ease&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;✅ HTTPS/SSL&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CLI is not available&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No custom domain&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You cannot deploy and manage multiple versions of your web app&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can make one project per account&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is internet outbound so you won't be able to scrape most of the websites you want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-heroku-%E2%86%97"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Heroku &lt;a href="https://www.heroku.com/"&gt;↗&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;✅ Git connect and deploy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;550-1,000 dyno hours per month&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5 apps(unverified accounts) &amp;amp; up to 100 apps(verified accounts)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;web app sleeps when no activity detects&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not that easy to deploy like others on the list&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-recommendations"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My Recommendations
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Vercel&lt;/code&gt; is the winner for sure for me. It has everything for free that I want and I will recommend vercel to you guys as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-can-i-deploy-my-flask-web-app-on-vercel"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How can I deploy my flask web app on vercel?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;download node from &lt;a href="https://nodejs.org/en/"&gt;https://nodejs.org/en/&lt;/a&gt; and make sure npm is accessible from your terminal by &lt;code&gt;npm -v&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download vercel cli using &lt;code&gt;npm i -g vercel&lt;/code&gt;. Refer &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/vercel"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add &lt;code&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt; file with all the python packages mentioned you've used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create your account on &lt;a href="https://vercel.com/"&gt;https://vercel.com/&lt;/a&gt;. It's pretty straightforward...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add &lt;code&gt;vercel.json&lt;/code&gt; file and add the below content(here I am using app.py as my main file)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="s"&gt;"version"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="s"&gt;"builds"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="s"&gt;"src"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"*.py"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="s"&gt;"use"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"@liudonghua123/now-flask"&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="s"&gt;"routes"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="s"&gt;"src"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"(.*)"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="s"&gt;"dest"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"app.py"&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;make sure your project looks something like this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XmmLXMJB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x212ogw561dpe3bhan1n.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XmmLXMJB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x212ogw561dpe3bhan1n.png" alt="Project structure" width="643" height="141"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;open terminal at the root of the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type the below commands&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8sSM-7lj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kbylguvtmjqef6kqi0v5.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8sSM-7lj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kbylguvtmjqef6kqi0v5.png" alt="Vercel in cmd" width="281" height="24"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NZwaAngn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9ysrgmob2jmjrr9no0k2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NZwaAngn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9ysrgmob2jmjrr9no0k2.png" alt="Vercel commands" width="880" height="164"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there you have it. visit &lt;a href="http://vercel.com"&gt;vercel.com&lt;/a&gt; and open your project. Click the visit button and your website is live. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;to later update just use &lt;code&gt;vercel --prod&lt;/code&gt; to push your code to production level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you see, it's that easy to upload your web app to the web for free in just 2 to 5 minutes. For this blog post, I have used the web template from this &lt;a href="https://github.com/StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-one-page-wonder"&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt;. If you want the complete code then visit&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;
      
    &lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I have deployed the website to &lt;a href="https://vercel-python-ten.vercel.app/"&gt;https://vercel-python-ten.vercel.app/&lt;/a&gt; if you want to check out.

      <title>Contact Form with Emailjs - React</title>
      <author>NJOKU SAMSON EBERE</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2021 06:31:10 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/ebereplenty/contact-form-with-emailjs-react-581c</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/ebereplenty/contact-form-with-emailjs-react-581c</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is majorly for frontend engineers/developers who have no backend skill or do not want to delve into it but needs a way to get contacted from their website at minimum cost. We will be using the REACT library/framework for the purpose of this article. Adapting to VUE, ANGULAR or any other framework isn't much of a task from here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article continues from where we stopped &lt;a href="https://dev.to/ebereplenty/contact-form-with-emailjs-plain-javascript-365l"&gt;last time&lt;/a&gt; we discussed how to implement Emailjs in our plain JavaScript code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now want to turn attention to implementing Emailjs in our React application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are about to begin...&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/sirYaPWyjCvEk/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/sirYaPWyjCvEk/giphy.gif" alt="Silence Now" width="441" height="384"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prerequisite"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Prerequisite
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article assumes that you already have basic knowledge of Emailjs such as setting up an account, Email service and Email template. We learnt all those in the previous article. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/ebereplenty/contact-form-with-emailjs-plain-javascript-365l"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; to catch up if you are behind. With that out of the way, let’s get busy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/q6RoNkLlFNjaw/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/q6RoNkLlFNjaw/giphy.gif" alt="Getting Busy" width="300" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#starter-application"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Starter Application
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get the starter code &lt;a href="https://github.com/EBEREGIT/react-emailjs/tree/starter-code"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or you can create a react project and replace the &lt;code&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; code with the following:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./App.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;col align-self-center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;text-center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Email&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;JavaScript&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Contact&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* &amp;lt;!-- contact form --&amp;gt; */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* &amp;lt;!-- name --&amp;gt; */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;form-group&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;              &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nx"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;form-control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nx"&gt;placeholder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;enter your name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;submit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;btn btn-primary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Submit&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      manifest.json provides metadata used when your web app is installed on a

    &lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!--
      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;npm i&lt;/code&gt; to install dependencies if you cloned the app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;npm start&lt;/code&gt; to load the project in a browser &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should have the following view on your browser &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PPchwXNM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/j2q0mol8khcllwfd5rgx.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PPchwXNM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/j2q0mol8khcllwfd5rgx.png" alt="Starter Project Preview" width="880" height="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#install-emailjs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Install Emailjs
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run the following command to install Emailjs&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;npm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;emailjs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;com&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;save&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#initialise-emailjs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Initialise Emailjs
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To initialise Emailjs, Import it in the &lt;code&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file like so:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;emailjs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;emailjs-com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#submit-form"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Submit Form
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To submit the form, we need to import the &lt;code&gt;useRef&lt;/code&gt; hook like so:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useRef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Learn more about &lt;code&gt;useRef&lt;/code&gt; hook &lt;a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useref"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next, initialise an instance of the useRef hook and name it &lt;code&gt;form&lt;/code&gt; like so:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next, Replace the opening &lt;code&gt;form&lt;/code&gt; tag with the following:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;ref=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;{form}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;onSubmit=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;{sendEmail}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;this gets the form inputs and submits it when the form is submitted&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now enter the following function just below the &lt;code&gt;const form = useRef();&lt;/code&gt; line:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sendEmail&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;preventDefault&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;emailjs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sendForm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;YOUR_SERVICE_ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;YOUR_USER_ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the code above, we stop page from refreshing when the form is submitted. Then we call the &lt;code&gt;sendForm&lt;/code&gt; function provided for us by &lt;code&gt;emailjs&lt;/code&gt;. For this to be successful, you need to replace &lt;code&gt;'YOUR_SERVICE_ID'&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID'&lt;/code&gt; and 'YOUR_USER_ID' with your own details.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get your USER_ID, go to your dashboard and click on the &lt;strong&gt;Integrations&lt;/strong&gt; link on the side menu. You should be on a page like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--B5jDSao1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1rbbfhxp5gbeiefh0q1w.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--B5jDSao1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1rbbfhxp5gbeiefh0q1w.JPG" alt="Image description" width="880" height="543"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your USER_ID is down below under the &lt;strong&gt;API Keys&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get YOUR_SERVICE_ID, click on the Email Services link in your dashboard's side menu&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q73euTMi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fn0w746c5fmsdokjabr7.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q73euTMi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fn0w746c5fmsdokjabr7.JPG" alt="YOUR_SERVICE_ID" width="696" height="359"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID, click on the Email Templates link in your dashboard's side menu and go to the settings tab like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BxftVbqm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dw3cr4xy0gwdbl9h5fsr.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BxftVbqm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dw3cr4xy0gwdbl9h5fsr.JPG" alt="YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID" width="880" height="582"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; You will need a new template for this tutorial if you have used the one you created before in another project like the &lt;a href="https://dev.to/ebereplenty/contact-form-with-emailjs-plain-javascript-365l"&gt;last project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now have this &lt;code&gt;sendEmail&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sendEmail&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;preventDefault&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;emailjs&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sendForm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;service_b4qmiqc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;template_h9rzd14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;user_UHpNJFij8MtQD1aAfs38X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;SUCCESS!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;FAILED...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Very Well Then, Let’s Proceed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have replaced the dummy strings with your value, then let's test our application by filling the form, submitting it, checking our console and email for new message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#test"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Test
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sending The Email&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--k9hCh5Tu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/738ncrg95fhtxm2r9sol.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--k9hCh5Tu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/738ncrg95fhtxm2r9sol.gif" alt="Sending The Email" width="599" height="260"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confirming that the email was received&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--64cOWvMd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wzkmv9hs6xqn4yeyrlad.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--64cOWvMd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wzkmv9hs6xqn4yeyrlad.gif" alt="Confirming that the email was received" width="600" height="245"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! You are a Champion for Getting this far...&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Simple way to generate random string in PHP</title>
      <author>Deepak Singh</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2021 06:18:40 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/techmesh/simple-way-to-generate-random-string-in-php-25gj</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/techmesh/simple-way-to-generate-random-string-in-php-25gj</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While developing an application, sometimes it requires generating a random but unique string, e.g. &lt;strong&gt;Password Generator, CSRF token&lt;/strong&gt;, and many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many methods to generate random and unique strings in PHP. For Example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;rand();
uniqid();
bin2hex(random_bytes(20));
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0CprJtQn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/shyuzpal9et2ewpjfbx7.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0CprJtQn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/shyuzpal9et2ewpjfbx7.jpg" alt="Simple way to generate random string in PHP" width="600" height="478"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But I prefer my way to generate a random string by using existing PHP functions and bit improvisation.&lt;br&gt;
Here is the function:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;function random_seed(){
  list($usec, $sec) = explode(' ', microtime());
  return $sec + $usec * 1000000;
}

function getRadomSeed(){
    mt_srand(random_seed());
    $prefix = substr(str_shuffle(str_repeat($x='abcNOPQRSTUVWXYZdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLM', ceil(5/strlen($x)) )),1,5);
    $suffix = substr(str_shuffle(str_repeat($x='wxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvPQRSTUVWXYZ', ceil(5/strlen($x)) )),1,5);
    $randval = mt_rand();
    if(strlen($randval) % 2 == 0){
        $random = $prefix.$randval.$suffix;
    }else if(strlen($randval) % 3 == 0){
        $random = $prefix.$suffix.$randval;
    }
    else{
        $random = $randval.$prefix.$suffix;
    }
    return $random;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Execute:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$rd = getRadomSeed();
echo $rd;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just to be sure that this is not the only way to generate random strings in PHP. I am just sharing one of my ways to generate random strings.&lt;br&gt;
Happy Thanksgiving! 🦃&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>3 Best Black Friday Deals for Online Educators, Instructors, and Course Creators in 2021</title>
      <author>javinpaul</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2021 05:39:30 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/javinpaul/3-best-black-friday-deals-for-online-educators-instructors-and-course-creators-in-2021-44i9</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: This post includes affiliate links; I may receive compensation if you purchase products or services from the different links provided in this article.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello Devs, if you love teaching online or want to build another income stream, I won't say passive as it require work but if you are determined to share your knowledge by teaching and looking for best black Friday deals 2021 for online course platforms then you have come to the right place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been suggesting programmers and developers to create online courses to both learn and earn in 2022 for quite some time and have been recommending &lt;a href="https://try.thinkific.com/javinpaul8817-blackfriday2424"&gt;Thinkific&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://teachable.sjv.io/c/1193463/998814/12646"&gt;Teachable&lt;/a&gt; to create their online courses and share their knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of you asked about discount coupons and deals to get started and that's why I am sharing the best discount offers for both Thinkific and Teachable platforms to create your online course business in 2021 -2022. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In today's world, there is no better way to teach than creating courses and this pandemic has proved that e-learning is going to stay and increase in near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, creating a course is easier said than done, especially if you are a perfectionist. There are a lot of things involved like choosing a camera, mike, &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/03/top-5-websites-to-create-online-courses.html"&gt;online course hosting platforms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/12/how-to-create-online-courses-for-free.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and buying other gear. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to invest in your online course creation tools and platforms then Black Friday and Cyber Monday are probably the best time to buy anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With lots of offers flying around it's difficult to choose which one to choose and which one to let go and that's why I am creating this page where you can find the best Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals for online course creators and educators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my second such list, yesterday, I posted about the &lt;a href="https://dev.to/javinpaul/10-best-black-friday-cyber-monday-deals-2021-for-programmers-and-developers-2hg1"&gt;best Black Friday deals for programmers&lt;/a&gt; and my readers were very happy about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I thought to put together a similar list for online course creators and educators, after all, I am also aiming to release my course as the next step after publishing my first book - &lt;a href="https://gumroad.com/l/QqjGH"&gt;Grokking the Coding Interview&lt;/a&gt;, and guess what I am going with &lt;a href="http://try.thinkific.com/javinpaul8817-blackfriday"&gt;Thinkfic&lt;/a&gt; to start my online course business.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My honest opinion on Tailwind CSS</title>
      <author>Chris Bongers</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2021 05:35:05 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/dailydevtips1/my-honest-opinion-on-tailwind-css-11m1</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/dailydevtips1/my-honest-opinion-on-tailwind-css-11m1</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I've written quite a few articles about Tailwind CSS and would really like to give my honest opinion about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seems to be a big divide between those loving Tailwind and those not loving it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is fine, eventually it's all up to someone what works for them, and what they like to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This is an opinionated article&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#when-not-to-use-tailwind"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  When not to use Tailwind
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, Tailwind should not be used if you don't have medium experience with CSS in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tailwind is a utility framework that can be used to optimize and speed up your development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose you are not familiar with how something would be set up in plain CSS. In that case, I personally think you might struggle to find the correct classes to use in Tailwind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-tailwind-rocks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why Tailwind rocks
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say you have medium to a good experience in building websites with p[lain CSS, you will most likely know what you want to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, when creating a header, all the styles are already in your head. You just need to type them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tailwind helps me in this process. I don't have to define all these little helpers classes to make an element a &lt;code&gt;flex&lt;/code&gt; item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another big pro is that it makes things stricter. Their sizing, padding, margin are all proven numbers that work. So I don't have to go and think about what generic sizes might be needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the ease of development, we recently got Tailwind JIT mode, making it even more powerful. We can now add any classes on the fly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tailwind also offers a purge mode, which cleans up your output CSS with only the classes you actually need.&lt;br&gt;
This purge process makes your end file as small as possible with only the classes you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#uniform-but-yet-so-different"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Uniform, but yet so different
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, I was afraid Tailwind would give us all the same kind of website. But this is not true at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though Tailwind has uniform classes, every website built with it is so different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And besides that, you can always add your own theming layer to Tailwind to make it more unique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also a lot of templates and elements available for us to take inspiration from and set up a basic structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some websites with Tailwind inspiration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://tailwind-elements.com/"&gt;Tailwind Elements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://tailwindui.com/"&gt;TailwindUI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://tailwindcomponents.com/"&gt;Tailwind Components&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://daisyui.com/"&gt;Daisy UI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many more out there, let me know what your favorites are, and I'll add them here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#responsive-and-selectors-just-work"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Responsive and selectors just work
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've always found responsiveness a pain, but it's been a breeze ever since switching to Tailwind.&lt;br&gt;
You're always only a couple classes away from making a beautiful responsive layout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the same goes for hover states, group hovers, and all those good things!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good thing to note is that Tailwind is mobile-first, so my general approach is to design the complete mobile layout and work my way up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way, you'll always have the correct flow in place for modifying elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#choose-what-works-for-you"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Choose what works for you
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, it's essential to evaluate what works for you.&lt;br&gt;
For me, Tailwind is a massive help, but for some projects, it's still overkill, and I write some custom CSS for those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you tried out Tailwind and don't like it, that's perfectly fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is always a suitable tool, for the right job, for a particular person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because not only should tools enhance our workflows, they should also make us, as the users of them, make it fun to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is your opinion on Tailwind?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#thank-you-for-reading-and-lets-connect"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Thank you for reading, and let's connect!

like  &lt;strong&gt;React&lt;/strong&gt; , &lt;strong&gt;Angular&lt;/strong&gt; , &lt;strong&gt;Next JS&lt;/strong&gt;  etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is a gist of some of the questions and concepts that i have came across in my interview for some product based startups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basics of javascript should be clear very much , Things like arrays , objects , variables etc should be very clear before even you think of applying at any job as a js dev.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arrays&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arrays are very important and since you will be using them so much in your day to day use case as being a web dev you should definitely learn all the things that can be done in js for arrays like &lt;br&gt;
     * Push&lt;br&gt;
     * pop&lt;br&gt;
     * shift&lt;br&gt;
     * unshift&lt;br&gt;
also you should learn how we iterate over arrays &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also learn these :-&lt;br&gt;
      * Slice&lt;br&gt;
      * Splice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every developer in his day to day life will definitely come across objects while working on a javascript project .&lt;br&gt;
So every interviewer expects you know the basics of Objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try to understand them and apply them in any of your projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Objects will also be used while you work on things like json all that is is a big blob of object so you have to work with them .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So try to understand all related topics to objects &lt;br&gt;
Things like how we add an item to an object&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to iterate through an object&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we delete an item from an object&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try to also learn things like object.keys , object.freeze etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Good Topics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every interviewer will ask you questions related to these questions so its very necessary that you know these concepts and can explain them in detail &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whats Execution context in js.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whats a promise and how to create one .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are callbacks &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whats async/await used for &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Difference between == and ===&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whats call , apply and bind .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Difference between simple functions and arrow functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whats 'this' in javascript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are closures &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whats memoization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what is an IIFE(Immediately Invoked Function Expression).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Difference between let and Var.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different stages of a promise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Difference between setTimeout and setInterval&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other topics also which you should give a good go before going for the interview , not everyone will ask you these but its good to know them &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whats prototype and prototypal inheritance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what are anonymous functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Event bubbling and how do you prevent that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whats promise.all&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whats a polyfill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many many topics in javascript that you would to know but for a fresher js or even for 1+ year of experience these are the most asked questions .&lt;br&gt;
You can also checkout the greats series by &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/pN6jk0uUrD8"&gt;Akshay Saini&lt;/a&gt; which explains all the javascript concepts in great detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All right , i guess this will be hopefully helpful for any one out there .&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial we will learn about how to create pdf document in C# with IronPdf. We will cover following topics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IronPdf&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create C#  Project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install IronPdf&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design the Form&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write Code for creating pdf documents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write Code for converting HTML to PDF document&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  IronPdf:
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IronPdf is a .Net library which provides us ability to create PDF, read PDF and manipulate them. The following tutorial will show how to create PDF files with IronPdf. This tutorial assumes that you have basis C#, Visual Studio and HTML knowledge. We need Visual Studio for writing, compiling and running our application, C# for writing logics and code, and HTML for formatting the pdf file such as making titles, headings, add images  and paragraph etc. This Library fully supports .Net 5, .Net core, standard and Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can create pdf file in C# with just few lines code, It's very easy task and need some little knowlede about C# and HTML. You can explore more about Ironpdf from this &lt;a href="https://ironpdf.com/"&gt;URL&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#install-ironpdf"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Install IronPdf:
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To develop a solution, we need to install &lt;a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/IronPdf"&gt;Nuget&lt;/a&gt; Package. Select "Project" from the Menu Bar, a Drop Down List appears. Select Manage NuGet Packages from the drop-down menu and click it. The window below will display.&lt;br&gt;

Once you've pressed the 'Ok' button, you're ready to go.&lt;br&gt;
Following Readme.txt file will open. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#readme-file"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Readme File:
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vqvJbF3o--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tjty5o73xaam01leboxi.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vqvJbF3o--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tjty5o73xaam01leboxi.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="444"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I recommend that you click on all of the links and learn more about this Library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#design-window-form"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Design Window Form:
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project has been created, and the Nuget package has been installed. The next step is to create a Window form that allows the user to enter text. The content can be saved as a pdf document.&lt;br&gt;
Open Form1 Design&lt;br&gt;
On the left side of the window, click on the 'Toolbar'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#toolbar"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ToolBar:
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yLtWcOZ2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/78wx18yenkdx0b45ps6m.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yLtWcOZ2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/78wx18yenkdx0b45ps6m.png" alt="Image description" width="788" height="1003"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We need a label to name our Application. A label can be found by searching for it from the toolbar and then dragging and dropping it onto the Form Design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give the label a name. I have named it as C# Create Pdf using IronPdf,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drag and drop one label named "Write Text Here (Use HTML Tags for Formatting)", one Rich text Box, and three buttons (one for saving the text to a pdf file, the other for clearing the text, and the third for closing the window).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#form"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Form:
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KYJK6vpX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0vjb8hnycnpoej53tf1u.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KYJK6vpX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0vjb8hnycnpoej53tf1u.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="540"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#write-code-for-generating-pdf-document"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Write Code for Generating Pdf document
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Double Click on Save Button, the following code will appear.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;private void Save_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) {}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Add the namespace of Ironpdf on the top of the .cs file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;using IronPdf;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, the actual work will start from here. We need a File path where we have to save our newly created pdf file. For that I am using SaveFile Dialog, that will ask user to select file path and file name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add Following Code inside the Save_Click Function.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;private void Save_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // Code for Select the folder to save the file.
    SaveFileDialog saveFileDialog1 = new SaveFileDialog();
    saveFileDialog1.InitialDirectory = @"D:\";      
    saveFileDialog1.Title = "Save Pdf File";
    saveFileDialog1.DefaultExt = "pdf";
    saveFileDialog1.Filter = "Pdf files (*.pdf)|*.pdf|All files (*.*)|*.*";
    saveFileDialog1.FilterIndex = 2;
    saveFileDialog1.RestoreDirectory = true;
    if (saveFileDialog1.ShowDialog() == DialogResult.OK)
    {
        string filename = saveFileDialog1.FileName;
        // actual code that will create Pdf files
        var HtmlLine = new HtmlToPdf();
        HtmlLine.RenderHtmlAsPdf(PdfText.Text).SaveAs(filename);
        // MessageBox to display that file save
        MessageBox.Show("File Saved Successfully!");
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SaveFileDialog will open a file dialog to select the folder and file name where you want to create a pdf file. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have set Initial Directory to D drive, but you can set it to any.&lt;br&gt;
I have set Default Extension to pdf files as we are only dealing with pdf files here. &lt;br&gt;
Inside the if condition, I have put the actual code that will create the pdf file. &lt;br&gt;
You can see that, With only two lines of code, we have managed to generate pdf file.&lt;br&gt;
PdfText is the name of a Rich text box in which we have our text to be written in a pdf file. &lt;br&gt;
The filename is the file path and name which the user has selected via save file dialogue.&lt;br&gt;
For more details please read the &lt;a href="https://ironpdf.com/docs/questions/create-pdf-csharp/"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#add-the-back-end-code-for-clear-and-close-button"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Add the Back End Code for Clear and Close Button
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Double Click on the clear button, the following code will appear.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;private void Clear_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) {}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Add the following code inside the Clear_Click function to clear the text feilds.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;private void Clear_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) {
    PdfText.Text = "";
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, Double click on Close Button, the following code will appear.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;private void Close_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) {}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Add the following code inside the Close_Click Function.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;private void Close_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) {
    this.Dispose();
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Run the Project.
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Press Ctrl + F5 to run the Project, the following window will appear.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--s4sW22_v--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qrgs9ut9np3fei1pnljz.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--s4sW22_v--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qrgs9ut9np3fei1pnljz.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="540"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Write Your text inside the Text Box. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have written the following text. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt; This is Sample Pdf File &lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt; This is the demo for C# Create Pdf using Iron Pdf &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Iron Pdf is a library which provides building functions for creating, reading &lt;br&gt;
and manipulating pdf files with just few lines of code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6vSOWh3s--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c6d0voqrhiqdl3imd34p.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6vSOWh3s--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c6d0voqrhiqdl3imd34p.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="312"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Now Click on the 'Save' button to save the file, the following window will appear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#file-explorer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  File Explorer:
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--v4Rph6pL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/510z7r2rbf2dnx7na9k5.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--v4Rph6pL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/510z7r2rbf2dnx7na9k5.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="609"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Select 'Folder' and write 'File' name. I have select D drive and set the file name as “C# Create Pdf”. Press the 'Save' button, the following message box will appear after successful creation of Pdf file. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#message-box"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Message Box:
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--feWEOH8c--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tebd15iq0hokb2x87y3a.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--feWEOH8c--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tebd15iq0hokb2x87y3a.png" alt="Image description" width="405" height="316"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Now, Let’s open the pdf file and see. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A file is created as shown below,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#output-file"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Output file:
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HxLyi45n--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/08946iq98w1ugy736n6c.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HxLyi45n--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/08946iq98w1ugy736n6c.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="675"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#summary"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Summary
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, we have seen that, reading pdf file file using C3 is very easy task. We can easily convert our html text to pdf document, our web link to pdf document, and manipulate them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iron software provides other useful libraries which provides us ability to create, read, and manipulate with the the Excel File, generating QR and Bar Cade, extracting text from image using OCR and many others.  If you will purchase complete suit, you will get all five libraries for the price of two. For more details, please refer to following &lt;a href="https://ironsoftware.com/suite/"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings the guide to a close. I hope you found it simple to follow and comprehend. If you have any questions, please post them in the comments section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can download the Project from this &lt;a href="https://ironpdf.com/downloads/csharp-create-pdf.zip"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to automatically generate release notes for your project</title>
      <author>Michelle Mannering</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2021 04:52:10 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/github/how-to-automatically-generate-release-notes-for-your-project-2ng8</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you ship a new version for your product, the last thing you want to worry about are release notes. They can take a lot of time, you might forget things, and they are often so much hassle maintainers leave them out entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, with GitHub's new automatically generated release notes feature, you'll never miss your changelog. Plus auto-generate notes will even include thanks to first time contributors ❤️.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's how to automatically generate release notes for your project's next release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-a-release-for-your-project"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Create a release for your project
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you want to create a new release for your project, make sure you've merged all the pull requests you want to include for that release. Then follow these steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;1. Navigate to your project's GitHub repo&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;2. Click "Releases" on the left side of the screen:&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_ZQDccDd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/o89vngxp5lhsgc6n8cpy.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_ZQDccDd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/o89vngxp5lhsgc6n8cpy.JPG" alt="Releases" width="880" height="255"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;3. Click "Create a new release"&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XrmJXNVJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ewbayi623h2d6ksxmkdf.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XrmJXNVJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ewbayi623h2d6ksxmkdf.JPG" alt="Create release" width="234" height="53"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;4. Click "Choose a tag":&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mSDFMOT4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5xq88umqmchzv9lf7md7.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mSDFMOT4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5xq88umqmchzv9lf7md7.JPG" alt="Choosing a tag" width="230" height="57"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;5. Type a new version number to create a new tag:&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Vtc73Y0e--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/t1tg3xqacfnuc34n0cl3.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Vtc73Y0e--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/t1tg3xqacfnuc34n0cl3.JPG" alt="Select your release version" width="464" height="248"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;6. Select the target branch:&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hVkNF7j4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lbsitb3hkg67tfyrkryz.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hVkNF7j4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lbsitb3hkg67tfyrkryz.JPG" alt="Automatically generate release notes" width="573" height="370"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;7. If you've selected to create a release from a new tag, the "Auto-generate release notes" button will now be unlocked:&lt;/ol&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7FeBXyOn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/m2wwvssmz6qh4at21nyc.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7FeBXyOn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/m2wwvssmz6qh4at21nyc.JPG" alt="automatically generate release notes" width="880" height="344"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt; 8. Instead of typing your release notes, click the "Auto-generate release notes" button:&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_XQQhfHy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rmxsnu9436nraglop9xn.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_XQQhfHy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rmxsnu9436nraglop9xn.JPG" alt="auto generate release notes" width="880" height="298"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now your release notes will be automatically generated. A title will be created for your release notes along with the body content. You'll notice there are auto-generated headings, each change is listed along with the contributor, and link to the PR. First time contributors even get a special mentione ✨&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--11dymkAU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/eutrf6ojz7s3ta6t9ml5.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--11dymkAU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/eutrf6ojz7s3ta6t9ml5.JPG" alt="auto generate release notes" width="880" height="477"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;9. Click "Publish release" to see your notes:&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--y9sE253U--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/aq6f3y5swgcpcwaigtc4.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--y9sE253U--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/aq6f3y5swgcpcwaigtc4.JPG" alt="Release notes" width="880" height="591"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this new feature, you'll never miss another changelog. Users can react to your release notes. Your release notes will also automatically generate a link to the full changelog where users can compare the changes. The more PRs merged since the previous release, the longer, and more detailed your new release notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#autogenerate-release-notes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Auto-generate release notes
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've also created a short video to show the above steps in action. You can check it out on our &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyqZjOrez0g&amp;amp;list=UUSH7c3Kb6jYCRj4JOHHZTxKsQ&amp;amp;ab_channel=GitHub"&gt;YouTube Shorts page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8ryjj5x6FlQ"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try this out on your project for your next version release. Read more about &lt;a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/automatically-generated-release-notes"&gt;auto-generated release notes on the GitHub Docs&lt;/a&gt;. If you have a major version release coming up, considering &lt;a href="https://github.com/github/release-radar"&gt;submitting your project&lt;/a&gt; to be featured in the &lt;a href="https://github.blog/?s=release+radar"&gt;GitHub Release Radar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
