      <description>&lt;p&gt;The year 2021 is about to end so let us recall and recollect what different tools have been used by Data Professionals throughout the entire year. I am using the term Data Professionals to refer to all different jobs associated with data like Data Scientists, Data Analysts, Data Engineers. To become a better Data Professional we need to have knowledge of different domains but the most important skill set required are knowledge of Databases and SQL, languages like Python, R, Julia, JavaScript, etc.,  experience in Data Visualization tools like Tableau and PowerBI,  and knowledge of Bigdata and Cloud Technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I am going to give a list of different tools and technologies which have been used extensively by Data Professionals throughout the year and the expertise of these can make you one of the best in the industry. This list is based on a survey conducted by Kaggle (the biggest community of Data Scientists). I have used the term toolset because it is a comprehensive list of tools from different domains. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ide"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  IDE
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common languages used for Data Science are Python, R, JavaScript, MATLAB, Julia along with SQL. These languages are used for data analysis and visualization, building machine learning algorithms, implementing data pipelines, and various other things related to Data science. The most important tool we require are IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) where we write code, compile them and then execute them to view the output. Here is a list of most common IDEs used by different Data professionals for development which makes their life easier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jupyter Notebook&lt;/strong&gt; - Jupyter Notebook is a web-based interactive computational environment for creating Jupyter notebook documents. It supports several languages like Python (IPython), Julia, R etc. and is largely used for data analysis, data visualization and further interactive, exploratory computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/strong&gt; - Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. It can be used for writing code in many languages and is one of the most popular IDE among Software engineers as well for its wide variety of features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jupyter Lab&lt;/strong&gt; - JupyterLab is the next-generation user interface including notebooks. It has a modular structure, where you can open several notebooks or files (e.g. HTML, Text, Markdowns etc) as tabs in the same window. It offers more of an IDE-like experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PyCharm&lt;/strong&gt; - PyCharm is an IDE used specifically for the Python language. It is developed by the Czech company JetBrains. It provides code analysis, a graphical debugger, an integrated unit tester, integration with version control systems, and supports web development with Django as well as data science with Anaconda. PyCharm is cross-platform, with Windows, macOS and Linux versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R Studio&lt;/strong&gt; - RStudio is an IDE for R, a programming language for statistical computing, data science, and data visualization. It is available in two formats: RStudio Desktop is a regular desktop application while RStudio Server runs on a remote server and allows accessing RStudio using a web browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spyder&lt;/strong&gt; - Spyder is an open-source cross-platform IDE for scientific programming in the Python language. Spyder integrates with a number of prominent packages in the scientific Python stack, including NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, pandas, IPython, SymPy and Cython, as well as other open-source software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notepad++&lt;/strong&gt; - Notepad++ is a text and source code editor for use with Microsoft Windows. It supports tabbed editing, which allows working with multiple open files in a single window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sublime text&lt;/strong&gt; - Sublime Text is a commercial source code editor. It natively supports many programming languages and markup languages. Users can expand its functionality with plugins, typically community-built and maintained under free-software licenses. To facilitate plugins, Sublime Text features a Python API.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vim or Emacs&lt;/strong&gt; - Vim is a free and open-source, screen-based text editor program for Unix. Emacs  or EMACS (Editor MACroS) is a family of text editors that are characterized by their extensibility. The manual for the most widely used variant, &lt;em&gt;GNU Emacs&lt;/em&gt;, describes it as "the extensible, customizable, self-documenting, real-time display editor". These two are used in the UNIX and LINUX based systems and are one of the oldest text editors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MATLAB&lt;/strong&gt; - MATLAB is a proprietary multi-paradigm programming language and numeric computing environment developed by MathWorks. MATLAB allows matrix manipulations, plotting of functions and data, implementation of algorithms, creation of user interfaces, and interfacing with programs written in other languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#algorithms"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Algorithms
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machine Learning is an integral part of Data Science and most of us are fascinated by the type of things it is doing in our day-to-day life like Self driven cars, Robots and AI assistants talking in almost human language, detection of diseases like cancer, facial recognition, etc. All these things are only possible because of data and the ML algorithms which work on this data. ML algorithms which are most widely used by Data scientists is listed below. It includes a wide variety of algorithms from most basic algorithms like regression and decision trees to high profile Deep Learning algorithms like Transformers, GANs and RNNs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linear and Logistic Regression&lt;/strong&gt; - These are the most basic algorithms of the ML ecosystem. Almost every data scientist learns these two algorithms as their first ML algorithm. Linear regression algorithm is basically a curve fitting algorithm which is used to determine trends and predict the value of dependent variable from independent variables. Logistic regression is used for classification tasks and finds probability of class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decision Trees or Random Forests&lt;/strong&gt; - Decision Trees are another popular ML algorithm where based on certain decisions the possible consequences are defined. It can be used for both classification and regression task. It is an ensemble technique that combines many different decision trees to give the output.  For classification tasks, the output of the random forest is the class selected by most trees. For regression tasks, the mean or average prediction of the individual trees is returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gradient Boosting Machines&lt;/strong&gt; - Gradient boosting is a machine learning technique used in regression and classification tasks, among others. It gives a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, which are typically decision trees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Convolutional Neural Networks&lt;/strong&gt; - A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a class of artificial neural network, most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery.  They have applications in image and video recognition, recommender systems, image classification, image segmentation, medical image analysis, natural language processing, brain-computer interfaces, and financial time series. CNNs are regularized versions of multilayer perceptrons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bayesian Approaches&lt;/strong&gt; - Bayesian inference is a method of statistical inference in which Bayes' theorem is used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dense Neural Networks&lt;/strong&gt; - It is another class of neural networks that is connected deeply, which means each neuron in the dense layer receives input from all neurons of its previous layer. The dense layer is found to be the most commonly used layer in the models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recurrent Neural Networks&lt;/strong&gt; - Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) are a type of Neural Network where the output from previous step are fed as input to the current step. It is the first algorithm that remembers its input, due to an internal memory, which makes it perfectly suited for machine learning problems that involve sequential data. The different variants of RNN architecture are Bidirectional recurrent neural networks (BRNN), Long short-term memory (LSTM), and Gated recurrent units (GRUs). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transformer Networks&lt;/strong&gt; - A transformer is a deep learning model that adopts the mechanism of attention, differentially weighting the significance of each part of the input data. It is used primarily in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and in computer vision (CV). Like recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers are designed to handle sequential input data, such as natural language, for tasks such as translation and text summarization. Some famous Transformer architectures are BERT and GPT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generative Adversarial Network&lt;/strong&gt; - Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs for short, are an approach to generative modeling using deep learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks. Generative modeling is an unsupervised learning task in machine learning that involves automatically discovering and learning the regularities or patterns in input data in such a way that the model can be used to generate or output new examples that plausibly could have been drawn from the original dataset. The GAN model architecture involves two sub-models: a generator model for generating new examples and a discriminator model for classifying whether generated examples are real, from the domain, or fake, generated by the generator model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evolutionary Approaches&lt;/strong&gt; - Evolutionary algorithms are a heuristic-based approach to solving problems that cannot be easily solved in polynomial time, such as classically NP-Hard problems, and anything else that would take far too long to exhaustively process. Genetic Algorithm is the most common evolutionary algorithm. It is used in Optimization of the neural networks and ML models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;

  Machine Learning Experiment Tools
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list below shows tools which are used for machine learning explainability and helping us better understand the ML algorithms like Tensorboard. It also contains tools for MLOPs like Weights and Biases, ClearML, Neptune.ai, etc. They are used to measure performance of models, keep logs, optimize ML pipelines, automate pipelines, and tune hyperparameters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;TensorBoard&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard"&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard&lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Automated Machine Learning Frameworks
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automated machine learning (AutoML) is the process of applying machine learning (ML) models to real-world problems using automation. More specifically, it automates the selection, composition and parameterization of machine learning models. These frameworks help in implementing AutoML. The different steps in traditional ML are data pre-processing, feature engineering, feature extraction, feature selection, algorithm selection, and hyperparameter optimization. AutoML helps automate this entire pipeline. AutoML dramatically simplifies these steps for non-experts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Google Cloud AutoML&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/automl"&gt;https://cloud.google.com/automl&lt;/a&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/salehmubashar/simple-python-exercises-4109</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi guys!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post we will be looking into a few simple python exercises or challenges that will be very useful in strengthening your concepts.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#exercise-1"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Exercise - 1
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find the number of upper case and lower case letters in a string.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For this challenge, we will loop through a string and count the number of upper and lower case letters in it. Then when all the characters have been checked, we will output the numbers.&lt;br&gt;
We will use the string 'The Dev Community is Amazing'.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"The Dev Community is Amazing"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#Variables to store the number of upper and lower case
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;UpperCase&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;LowerCase&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#loop through the string
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;#check for upper case
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"A"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Z"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;UpperCase&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;#check for lowercase
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;elif&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"a"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"z"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;LowerCase&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#print the final number.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"UpperCase letters:"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;UpperCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"and LowerCase letters:"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;LowerCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The output for this string will be:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;UpperCase letters: 4 and LowerCase letters: 20
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#exercise-2"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Exercise - 2
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write the multiplication table of a number to 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In this one, we will write the multiplication table of any number input by user.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#user input
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Enter a number: "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#loop from 1 to 5 and write the multiplication for each
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"*"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"="&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#output"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Output:
&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Enter a number: 5
5 * 1 = 5
5 * 2 = 10
5 * 3 = 15
5 * 4 = 20
5 * 5 = 25
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#exercise-3"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Exercise - 3
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find the number of even numbers in a given range&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For this one, we will take a range of numbers from the user and give the number of even numbers in that range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number is even if its remainder is 0 when it is divided by 2.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#user inputs the range
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Number1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Enter starting number: "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Number2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Enter last number: "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#Store number of even numbers
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Even&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#check each number in range
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Number1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Number2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;#check if number is  even
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;Even&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Number of even numbers are:"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Even&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#output"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Output:
&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Enter starting number: 1
Enter last number: 4
Number of even numbers are: 2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;






&lt;p&gt;These were the 3 simple python exercises every beginner should try to strengthen their concepts and get some useful practice&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you all found them useful.&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Create Notepad editor with Python using Tkinter</title>
      <author>rrtutors</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 13 Nov 2021 16:23:42 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/rrtutors/create-notepad-editor-with-python-using-tkinter-21ap</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/rrtutors/create-notepad-editor-with-python-using-tkinter-21ap</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Develop a Notepad editor with Tkinter .Tkinter is Python GUI toolkit which will provide GUI interface. To create this notepad editor we need to add Tkinter library. This Project contains functionalities like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create new File&lt;br&gt;
Open new File&lt;br&gt;
Save File&lt;br&gt;
Exit Editor&lt;br&gt;
Cut, Copy and Past functionalities&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AmCIWvZV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://rrtutors.com/uploads/langpostimg/notepad-editor-with-python.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AmCIWvZV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://rrtutors.com/uploads/langpostimg/notepad-editor-with-python.JPG" alt="Python Notepad application" width="880" height="408"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to install Tkinter library?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To install Tkinter we need pre installed python, when we install python we need to check td/tk and IDLE checkbox which will install Tkinter library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we missed it while install python we can install Tkinter separately by run the pip command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Tkinter can be installed by pip, we need to run below command&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pip&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tk&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This will download and install all required packages for Tkinter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now create python project and import required packages&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tkinter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tkinter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;messagebox&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tkinter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;filedialog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="nn"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;Notepad:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;__root&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Tk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here we have imported two other packages called messagebox and filedialog&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tech-blogging the easy way</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/sroehrl/tech-blogging-the-easy-way-347m</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately I have seen a lot of posts here about how to set up your own blog. It's not a surprise that a regular Wordpress-installation doesn't really scream developer. On my personal blog &lt;a href="https://neoan.us/blog"&gt;neoan.us/blog&lt;/a&gt;, I use &lt;a href="https://blua.blue"&gt;blua.blue&lt;/a&gt; and if you are a follower you will notice that many of my dev.to contributions originate from there as well (whenever I want to publish to multiple sites/services). However, knowing that the PHP-crowd here is miniscule I decided to provide you with 2 repositories you can start with that do not require the use of the blua.blue-API (because they are webhook-based) and allow you to simply design your blog using the means of your choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Repo&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;serverless framework&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div class="ltag-github-readme-tag"&gt;
  &lt;div class="readme-overview"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;
      &lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--i3JOwpme--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev.to/assets/github-logo-ba8488d21cd8ee1fee097b8410db9deaa41d0ca30b004c0c63de0a479114156f.svg" alt="GitHub logo"&gt;
      &lt;a href="https://github.com/sroehrl"&gt;
        sroehrl
      &lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://github.com/sroehrl/serverless-blog"&gt;
        serverless-blog
      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;
      
    &lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="ltag-github-body"&gt;
    
&lt;div id="readme" class="md"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
blua.blue Serverless Framework Node Express API on AWS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This POC is based on the serverless node/express/api template with added support for
s3 bucket storage and rendering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a bucket and ensure that your AWS cli AIM has the required permissions to read &amp;amp; write to this bucket.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change line 8 of handler.js accordingly: &lt;code&gt;const bucketName = 'my-article-storage-bucket'&lt;/code&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
Deployment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install dependencies with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="snippet-clipboard-content position-relative overflow-auto"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then deploy with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="snippet-clipboard-content position-relative overflow-auto"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;serverless deploy
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Enhance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current setup is a POC to ease local development (when using serverless-local).
Ultimately, you may want to set up your bucket as a website and permanently render
what is now done in &lt;code&gt;app.get('/:slug?)&lt;/code&gt; to HTML files (pug.compileFile) to enjoy a static blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="gh-btn-container"&gt;&lt;a class="gh-btn" href="https://github.com/sroehrl/serverless-blog"&gt;View on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;file-based (mono-repo node &amp;amp; PHP)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div class="ltag-github-readme-tag"&gt;
  &lt;div class="readme-overview"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;
      &lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--i3JOwpme--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev.to/assets/github-logo-ba8488d21cd8ee1fee097b8410db9deaa41d0ca30b004c0c63de0a479114156f.svg" alt="GitHub logo"&gt;
      &lt;a href="https://github.com/sroehrl"&gt;
        sroehrl
      &lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://github.com/sroehrl/minimal-blog"&gt;
        minimal-blog
      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;
      
    &lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="ltag-github-body"&gt;
    
&lt;div id="readme" class="md"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
minimal-blog&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
blua.blue webhook POC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This little repo can be run either with node or PHP and serves as a proof of concept for blua.blue based blogs without using the API or SDKs.
Both the PHP-version and the node-version are based on a total of less than 75 lines of code. The PHP version is even completely free of dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project is was to create the easiest possible setup to host your own blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See it here:
&lt;a href="https://equinox-vivacious-havarti.glitch.me/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://equinox-vivacious-havarti.glitch.me/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
How to use&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don't have an account, sign up at &lt;a href="https://blua.blue" rel="nofollow"&gt;blua.blue&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clone, fork or download this repo and host it depending on your needs*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up webhooks on blua.blue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PHP-endpoint: &lt;code&gt;https://your-site.com/receive.php&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;node-endpoint: &lt;code&gt;https://your-site.com/receive&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Be careful of hosting via services like heroku: many of these services delete files written to the file-system after some idle time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it. Enjoy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="gh-btn-container"&gt;&lt;a class="gh-btn" href="https://github.com/sroehrl/minimal-blog"&gt;View on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-use-them"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to use them
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After deploying one of these versions, sign up with blua.blue and navigate to your profile. You will find the tab "Webhooks". With both repositories, you will want to generate a webhook to &lt;code&gt;https://your-endpoint.tld/receive&lt;/code&gt;. There is no need for a token as we check for allowed origins, but ultimately you will want to set one of your choice and then verify the source of the payload (sent through authorization header as bearer token) in order to prevent other blua.blue-users to post on your behalf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#thats-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  That's it
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, please be aware of two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These repos are very basic and meant to be a boilerplate rather than a final solution. I am happy to accept pull-requests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share! If you built something beautiful, let everyone know in the comments!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>How to Drive and Convert More B2B Leads with Webinars</title>
      <author>Margo Ovsiienko</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 13 Nov 2021 15:01:53 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/margo_ovsiienko_a873f908a/how-to-drive-and-convert-more-b2b-leads-with-webinars-4g1o</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/margo_ovsiienko_a873f908a/how-to-drive-and-convert-more-b2b-leads-with-webinars-4g1o</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In most online resources that will teach you how to conduct successful webinars, you will most likely get generic tips on setting up landing pages, choosing webinar software, and promoting it on social channels. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having conducted dozens of webinars that turned out to be both successes and failures, I have learned that one can succeed with webinars only through practice – by making mistakes and improving with every live transmission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it – anyone can set up a virtual room and read a presentation. The truth is when you know the basics and do everything according to the book, you can still fail. Why? The devil is in the details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, I will share my key learnings from organizing the webinars, which helped attract the right highly-engaged audience. No matter if you decide to run webinars on your own or hire a marketer to help you during this process — in both cases, you will acquire the right mindset to help you conduct successful webinars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-generate-more-leads-with-webinars"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to generate more leads with webinars
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive deeper into eight tips to organize and successfully promote webinars that gather a full room of highly targeted prospects. These are the boxes you need to tick before you go live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Choose the right topic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Even though choosing the right topic seems to be the most obvious thing on Earth when it comes to webinars, you can make the most mistakes with this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When choosing the topic for your webinar, avoid general descriptive topics that don’t address these two points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eliminate pain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help achieve the desired outcome
In other words, your webinar topic should either be a pain killer or a vitamin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at the webinar case study of Drift, a company famous for using chatbot marketing hacks for lead generation. It’s clear what the webinar helps achieve. Also, it’s quite specific. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bringing up a unique case study in the headline is what makes this webinar valuable! Incorporating case studies and numbers in your topic makes it much easier for you to convince prospects to sign up for it during the stage of webinar promotion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YmKdO6YY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cak73bhmvzytzy6qmsct.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YmKdO6YY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cak73bhmvzytzy6qmsct.png" alt="Drift webinar" width="880" height="405"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protip: you can also tweak the topic to repel your “negative persona” or people who will never become your customers. Make sure you clearly state who the webinar is for and who won’t derive value from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, by stating the webinar is for SaaS growth consultants, you would turn away junior marketing people. Make sure you have aligned the benefits of the webinar with your persona’s personal and professional goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Co-host with industry influencers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Even though your company might not have a recognizable brand just yet, you can enhance your image by inviting industry thought leaders who have already built a reputation.&lt;br&gt;
Check out how Lemlist, an outreach tool, does it with sales and marketing heroes. They have hosted a series of webinars with sales and growth marketing experts that went viral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--oWCl5mNj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5ja6mmba98ls3ukctkxy.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--oWCl5mNj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5ja6mmba98ls3ukctkxy.jpg" alt="example of webinar" width="880" height="539"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do your research online to find influencers in your field who have a well-developed and engaged social media network. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find out how popular their materials are by looking into engagement metrics such as comments, likes, and reposts. Check out the popularity of their Youtube channels and page traffic to find out if they have built a sufficient legacy in their field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you hit a message to an influencer, think carefully about what you can offer in return. For example, you could create a video that you could post on your closed group or promote with Facebook ads – this will help an influencer reach a new audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By creating a win-win situation you will be able to get even more recognizable people to join you every time you conduct the next webinar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Design landing page copy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Before you start &lt;a href="https://sellcoursesonline.com/best-sales-funnel-software#webinar-platforms"&gt;choosing your webinar software&lt;/a&gt; and setting up a virtual room, try to be as precise with your webinar value proposition as possible. If you are targeting your content at the B2B segment you should know how busy the decision-makers are and how little time you have to convince them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Show real benefits and explain the reasons why someone would spend an hour of their time to watch your live transmission.&lt;br&gt;
Perhaps this makes sense as you have managed to invite an “industry celebrity” that can share their secret sauce and their latest case studies or it may also be your know-how on solving specific problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you write concise and easy to understand sentences one can skim fast online. Use bullet points and icons to support your statements visually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Optimize your signup form&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Even if your topic and value proposition for the webinar is great, your landing page and signup form might underperform resulting in lost leads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the most common issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Sign up form contains a lot of fields&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Don’t overwhelm your users – make your sign-up form simple and short. Ask for basic information – you can always collect more information about their profiles later on. &lt;br&gt;
Let’s examine the form placed on the webinar page of Outreach. One – it is annoying to fill in all the fields. Two – let’s be honest: would you provide all the correct information? On the contrary, you may still decide to randomly fill it in just to get a sign-up link. So what’s the point? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1KUW69XU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c31hb9wokl4rd2j12s2g.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1KUW69XU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c31hb9wokl4rd2j12s2g.png" alt="signup form example" width="880" height="450"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider collecting as little information about your leads as possible to make it easier to sign up. You can even sign up your contact using a chatbot and don’t need to have a complex sign up system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Your sign up form doesn’t work properly&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Perhaps, there is some bug which causes problems on sign up. First, check out the process on different browsers by yourself or use special testing tools. Next, install heatmaps and track user interaction with the forms to identify issues. Keep an eye on mobile performance as well – your form might look differently on smaller devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Your sign up form is not intuitive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Make sure you provide a user with clear guidance on what information needs to be filled in and where. Sometimes, users don’t know what’s wrong as a warning message is not displayed correctly. That is why you have to test your forms by yourself or some test users and work on eliminating critical form usability issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Book at least 1 month for promotion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Setting up a landing page and choosing the most optimal webinar platform is not rocket science. When organizational aspects of the webinar make 20% of work, 80% of effort needs to be dedicated to promotion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you have planned for at least 3-4 weeks of promotion prior to the webinar. For this, you have to calculate how many leads you are planning to generate, define channels, and allocate budget to each of them respectively. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are just some ideas for you to incorporate into your webinar promotion strategy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Use social media management tools to schedule posts prior to the webinar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*Consider incorporating video marketing into your promotional activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design and send email newsletters to your subscribers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up website popups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launch &lt;a href="https://www.sortlist.com/online-ad/dubai-ae"&gt;paid ads&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Track progress every week to know if you are on track with your lead targets. If you have already dealt with webinar promotion before, you can benchmark against historical data on lead generation and marketing costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t leave promotion for the last week if you want your effort to pay off in leads and sales!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Get co-hosts to promote&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Apart from spending money on paid channels, you can also engage your guests in the promotion process. Ask if they can schedule a social media post to promote your webinar. Encourage them to promote your webinar on their channels, send newsletters, and post on their groups. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stress out that your webinar is a win-win game and your influencers can use your &lt;a href="https://www.andcards.com/blog/member-experience/virtual-community-events/"&gt;online event&lt;/a&gt; as a tool to nurture their leads as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By inviting their potential clients to the webinar, they also boost awareness about themselves and can use it as another sales touchpoint. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, don’t be overbearing with your requests. Make co-promotion optional for your guests. Also, if you have chosen the right thought leaders and built trust with them prior to the webinar, you can be sure they won’t leave you alone with promotion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s also just a simple physiological mechanism! They will love to brag about the fact someone has invited them to the webinar as an expert unless they are extremely high-caliber speakers who get hundreds of such invitations every month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Engage leads before the webinar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Even though you might set up the target for the number of leads you want to generate, you should also define the turn-up rate as a key metric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more leads you manage to attract to the webinar, the more chances you have to build awareness about your brand’s expertise and convince them to buy your products. That is why you have to engage your leads prior to the webinar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set up automatic reminders on the day and 15 minutes before the event. Apart from sending an email with a reminder, you can also consider using SMS marketing and send SMS reminders if you have collected phone numbers through your sign up form. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider creating drip sequences that would educate your audience on the webinar topic before they join a live transmission. You can decide to send them one email weekly before the webinar or come up with another frequency. Don’t sell anything in your emails – make them educational and highly valuable for your audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Nurture leads after the webinar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Create some special offers for your users and place them on the webinar replay page. You can consider including your product reviews there as well as it will provide an additional boost to your attendees’ confidence in buying your product. Remember that 9 out of 10 customers read reviews before they end up buying a product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget to set up &lt;a href="https://agilitycms.com/resources/posts/7-email-marketing-tips-that-can-increase-sales-in-2022"&gt;post-webinar email sequences&lt;/a&gt; as a part of your sales automation strategy. The sequences should continue educating a user on the topic after the webinar is over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that webinars take some time to convert. That is why you have to not only retarget users with your company case studies and your client’s success stories to build trust with your company but also use other &lt;a href="https://www.mayple.com/blog/marketing-strategy"&gt;marketing channels&lt;/a&gt; to reach them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, apart from &lt;a href="https://www.voilanorbert.com/blog/email-follow-up/"&gt;email follow-ups&lt;/a&gt;, you can also consider adding a webinar attendee on LinkedIn. Engage them in a conversation and continue to build relationships to be top of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t be afraid to create multiple touchpoints with your leads for a better result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to some studies, one needs eight touch points, on average, to make a proposal and close the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wrap up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The best way to learn how to conduct successful webinars is to practice supported by smart tools. That is why I encourage you to start applying these tips in practice, understand what channels drive the most sign-ups and conversion, and invest in them more during the consequent online events. This way you will be able to achieve better results with each live session. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>8 Most Common Type Of Cyber Attacks</title>
      <author>Prajwol Shrestha</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 13 Nov 2021 14:43:43 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/prajwolshrestha/8-most-common-type-of-cyber-attacks-2be5</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/prajwolshrestha/8-most-common-type-of-cyber-attacks-2be5</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before learning about types of cyber attacks, you must know what a cyber attack is. Basically, it is an attack performed by a group or an individual to gain unauthorized access to a system with the intent to harm the victim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we will briefly learn about some of the most common types of cyber attacks  and how to protect yourself from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-phishing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Phishing:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phishing involves sending emails that appear to be from trusted sources. The goal is to make the victim click on the link and trick them into giving their login credentials or spreading malware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spear phishing is carried out in the same way, except it is more focused on particular people. The attacker has to do some research on the victim before sending them the malicious link. For example, with a little research an attacker can find your friend’s email and send you the malicious link which might appear to be a legitimate email from your friend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Protect yourself:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think before you click.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verify a site’s security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never give out personal information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-password-attack-amp-credential-reuse"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Password Attack &amp;amp; Credential Reuse:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attacker will use an array of password hacking techniques. The attacker might use a list of common ‘weak’ passwords, to sophisticated ‘Rainbow table’ attacks using previously hacked/cracked passwords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to protect yourself:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*Use a strong password.&lt;br&gt;
*Don’t use the same password on different platforms.&lt;br&gt;
*Use two-factor authentication (2FA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-dos-and-ddos"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. DOS and DDOS:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It stands for Denial Of Service and Distributed Denial Of Service respectively. The difference between them is that DOS is an attack mode between a single machine and a single machine, whereas a DDOS attack is a large-scale attack mode based on DOS. DDOS uses a group of controlled computers (Botnets) to attack a host. &lt;br&gt;
The idea of both these attacks is to send a high volume of data or traffic through a network that is making a lot of connection requests until the server becomes overloaded and can no longer function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to prevent DDOS attacks:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*Protect your DNS Servers.&lt;br&gt;
*Configure your network hardware against DDOS attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-driveby-downloads"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Drive-By Downloads:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike other cyber attacks, you don’t have to open an email attachment or download anything. You will get infected simply by viewing an email or by visiting a website that will automatically download malware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to protect yourself:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*Keep your OS and browsers updated.&lt;br&gt;
*Only keep the programs you need, the more plug-ins you have, the more vulnerable you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-man-in-the-middlemitm"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Man In The Middle(MitM):
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hacker places himself between two communicating hosts and listens to their information. &lt;br&gt;
This attack is similar to the Eavesdropping attack but is much more dangerous. The attacker can not only listen to their information but can also impersonate one of them or change the context of the information being sent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Protect Yourself:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*Make sure you use SSL certificates (HTTPS, not just HTTP) to enhance security.&lt;br&gt;
*Use VPN to enhance security when using untrusted networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-malvertising"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. Malvertising:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This attack will compromise your system with malicious code that is automatically downloaded to your system when you click on an infected advertisement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to protect yourself:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*Don’t click on advertisements just because they look appealing.&lt;br&gt;
*Keep your OS, browsers, and plug-in updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#7-sql-injection"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  7. SQL Injection:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It stands for Structured Query Language Injection. The attacker inserts malicious SQL code into the website’s search box or input box. Once the code has been deployed, it might delete or modify data on the database and even copy the whole database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to protect yourself:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*Use input validation on input fields.&lt;br&gt;
*Update and patch your software and database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#8-zeroday-exploit"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  8. Zero-Day Exploit:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Zero-Day exploit is an attack that occurs on the same day a weakness is discovered on software. This type of attack is usually hard to defend against since the precise nature of the attack is only known after it has happened. When a person discovers a vulnerability on software instead of directly reporting to the creators of the software, he decides to share this vulnerability on the internet. The hackers then exploit this vulnerability before the creators of the software could patch the vulnerability. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;How to protect yourself:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*Keep your OS and software up-to-date.&lt;br&gt;
*Only use SSL certified websites.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Create a Nexus Repository with Windows Containers</title>
      <author>Federico Navarrete</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 13 Nov 2021 14:09:01 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/fanmixco/how-to-create-a-nexus-repository-with-windows-containers-e0p</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/fanmixco/how-to-create-a-nexus-repository-with-windows-containers-e0p</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Docker is an extremely powerful tool. You often build your own image using X image or X Linux distros like Ubuntu or Debian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our case, we have a Nexus repository running in Windows but we started to move everything to AWS. The greatest challenge happened when we were not able to migrate the DB. Regardless, the configuration we chose, the repo started to crash over and over again. The only option was to move the old VM as a new EC2 which was a bad deal since this would be our only EC2 because the rest was running in containers in ECS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while, we thought of a new solution, we had heard about Windows Containers, something that is not so well-known. And this is the solution that we came with:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;FROM mcr.microsoft.com/windows/nanoserver:1809
RUN mkdir "c:\\nexus"
WORKDIR c:/nexus
RUN mkdir sonatype-work
RUN mkdir nexus-3.36.0-01
COPY nexus-3.36.0-01 .
COPY sonatype-work .
WORKDIR c:/nexus/nexus-3.36.0-01/bin
EXPOSE 8081
CMD ["nexus.exe /run"]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first line downloads a copy of &lt;strong&gt;Windows Nano Server&lt;/strong&gt;, which has the smallest footprint. And later, we configured the location that we wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number &lt;strong&gt;3.36.0-01&lt;/strong&gt; represents our current version of the Nexus repo, it can change over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that's all that you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, something important to highlight, this solution doesn't show any logs for any reason and takes some time to run it the first time. So, if you start hitting: &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:8081&lt;/code&gt; in minute one, it might not work, it takes a while maybe 3 to 5 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What is Git? How will it help you?</title>
      <author>Sushrut Mishra</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 13 Nov 2021 13:07:09 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/sushrutkm/what-is-git-how-will-it-help-you-4m5k</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/sushrutkm/what-is-git-how-will-it-help-you-4m5k</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZqwTtpA6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6vq45tzju4l6m3aijeoq.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZqwTtpA6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6vq45tzju4l6m3aijeoq.png" alt="git" width="876" height="430"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-git"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Git?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Git is a version control system that helps you keep track of changes in your project. It is &lt;strong&gt;open source and distributed&lt;/strong&gt;. Git can keep track of the smallest of changes, no matter how large your project is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But hey, what do you mean by keep track of changes? What does a version control system mean? Don't worry, let me form words in a beginner-friendly way -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A version control system is basically a tool that helps you manage all sorts of changes to your software code. Since, Git is a version control system, it allows you to - &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Store all your code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage &amp;amp; Track changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Makes it available for others to use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Git is a distributed version control system&lt;/strong&gt; which makes the third point valid. This feature allows other people to access, save, and modify the source code as per their requirements. However, this doesn't affect your personal project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-will-you-benefit-from-git"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How will you benefit from Git?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you know that Git helps you manage your code. Moreover, it also helps you upload, outsource, or store your code. There are a few cloud-based hosting services that let you do that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GitHub! You must have heard about it. GitHub is the most popular hosting service that lets you store your personal projects, code, and open-source projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a developer, in most cases, GitHub ends up as your portfolio. A great GitHub profile allows clients &amp;amp; recruiters to look at the projects you've worked on, how often you contribute, and all those metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Git &amp;amp; GitHub combined help you -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save your code for life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with other developers and work together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track changes of the project since its inception!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find people working on similar projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build your Public Portfolio! C'mon!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you know what Git is and how it can benefit you, I recommend you start using Git &amp;amp; GitHub. Whether you write a one-liner or end up making a whole project, upload every one of it on GitHub. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climb your way up the ladder. One by One. Happy Coding! Happy Git-ting! xD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Journey From Nothing to Game Designer</title>
      <author>Mr. Unity Buddy</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 13 Nov 2021 12:48:03 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/unitybuddy/my-journey-from-nothing-to-game-designer-487k</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/unitybuddy/my-journey-from-nothing-to-game-designer-487k</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, buddies!! Today is something special for me, it's my Birthday 🙈🙈  So, I was thinking about what should I write on this day and someone from myself told me "Why don't you write about your first &lt;code&gt;Hello, World&lt;/code&gt;?" &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3eXJUyrk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635961918664/NNWNFF53l.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3eXJUyrk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635961918664/NNWNFF53l.png" alt="image.png" width="480" height="360"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#30-mpd-gaming"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  30 MPD Gaming 🥴
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NYEp6RJq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635959981605/y1J1PiIXE.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NYEp6RJq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635959981605/y1J1PiIXE.png" alt="image.png" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Almost every game designer is a Gamer(It's a must!). So it was the same with me but I played games only for 30 minutes, maximumly, 1 hour. I know, I know a normal person plays a video game for at least 2 hours. The reason with me wasn't that I'm not interested in Gaming, but I had a lot, I mean a really lot of studies and work to do. Besides, I can't play well-performing games on my old windows 8 laptop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I never wanted to be a Game Designer, even though I love video games. I was just a simple buddy who have never heard of C#, Game Engines, Github, etc. One day, everything was changed. I can't remember why I was forced to watch Brackey's Cube Run tutorial, maybe I watched it for fun. But that's the day my real-life got started!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#making-the-first-ever-game"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Making the First ever Game
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the same day that I watched Brackey's tutorial, I got a Unity ID and installed Unity and other stuff. Must say that it took me a day to set up Projects with my Old windows 8. But I still wonder that how I was able to install Unity on my machine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, my first piece of code wasn't &lt;code&gt;Hello, World&lt;/code&gt;; it was &lt;code&gt;public Rigidbody Rb;&lt;/code&gt; 😋&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to make an actual copy of the Cube Run game but I changes the concept a little bit, actually a lot in the middle of the project. &lt;br&gt;
This is a very, very simple game that can be made in a day. But trust me, it took me 2 months to finish this. I learned so many things and I still believe that it wasn't a waste of time, never! I found a community, I learned how to get used to resources around me, and most importantly, a bug that wasted your day may get fixed on the next day without any effort! 🐛&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-ontriggerenter-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;OnTriggerEnter&lt;/code&gt; 😆
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often experience this so I never forgot this &lt;strong&gt;bug&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;OnTriggerEnter&lt;/code&gt; function is used to do something when the Player passes through a trigger. So simply, it was not working. I put Debug.Logs,  used similar somewhat similar functions to see whether it is a problem with physics or something. And tried to get help from experts even. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They told me different things like "you might as well check the collision matrix", "You should first put a debug.log outside of the if so you know if the problem is with the od part or the ontriggrenter part" and so many things!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Sh-THzfo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635786271590/REdy6NlWb.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Sh-THzfo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635786271590/REdy6NlWb.png" alt="image.png" width="880" height="87"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Bruh 😑&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of them suggested turning on Mesh Renderer :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mMbQ1N_1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635785716120/HCtXI2dsZ.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mMbQ1N_1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635785716120/HCtXI2dsZ.png" alt="image.png" width="880" height="553"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it can't collide with the Trigger if it is above the Player 😏&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#finding-a-niche"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Finding a Niche
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a typical absolute beginner, I wanted to make a game that will become a trend and have Millions of downloads! So, I thought that a game like a COD will help me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to make a simple FPS game from a Unity Template. After 2 or 3 days of playing with it, I realized that FPS isn't for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By those days, I attended Unity's Create with Code live sessions and they taught me to make a good RPG game. Wow, that's so easy! I will make this for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I played some time with RPG games as well. Though they are easy to understand than FPS games, I found that was Boring for me and I don't have a passion for RPG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, my first game has been played by near about 200 Unity devs and I got good feedback as it was my first ever game. And One day, A Hyper-casual game studio asked me to join their team as a 1st Tier Developer. And boom, they said my game has a good Hyper-casual look. Why didn't I think about Hyper-Casual!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was only about 2 and a half months I have started with Unity but I didn't want to miss this chance 🤓&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#firstever-colloboration"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  First-ever Colloboration
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were using Github for collab as usual but I was troubling what an erratic thing is this! Of course, they got confused when I said I don't know Github but I just told them that I have only used Unity's itself Collab feature and it went OK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZDaf4pJK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635783563093/1WzERPiKa.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZDaf4pJK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635783563093/1WzERPiKa.gif" alt="hammaya-relaxed.gif" width="220" height="249"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Phew!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the team lead was kind enough to teach me about this and how to set it up. Although I didn't understand how it exactly works, I got it after a few days!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-game"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Game
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sEfXbH1s--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635960453902/OxSMQH__c.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sEfXbH1s--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635960453902/OxSMQH__c.png" width="249" height="512"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was half-made a one. We had to do a lot of things, Shop, Leaderboard, Power-ups, Bug fixes, and a lot! But I didn't find it stressful just because our team had at least 2 people in almost every role! Head Programmers, 1st Tier Devs, 2nd Tier Devs, 3D modelers, Sound artists, Testers, etc. Every task is divided and it was my baby steps to Project Management and Marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jXUtEpLV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635784731119/3u1yuJw0q.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jXUtEpLV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635784731119/3u1yuJw0q.png" alt="image.png" width="880" height="410"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time that we finished and published the game, I left them because it didn't seem official anymore. A few members were joined and they are thinking everyone is the same as them or something and the real-talented people left the team. I didn't think that I should be there anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I got another offer from a Great team to work with them as a Content Creator! I hope this is gonna be better than before 🤞&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#goodbye-unity-will-see-you-again"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Good-Bye, Unity, will see you again! 👋
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yeah, I'm gonna take a little break from the game design, just because I got a new role to work with I think this is gonna be the same with writing future but I try my best to manage them all. Just don't think I'm giving up haha ✌&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that's all for now. Thanks a lot for reading this self-centered article. Goodbye and happy coding! See you soon 😉&lt;/p&gt;
