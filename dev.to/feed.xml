  Amazon Personalize new features
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--I7Ll8P8j--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7vvuxg95fg5w1vt6pe25.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--I7Ll8P8j--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7vvuxg95fg5w1vt6pe25.png" alt="Image description" width="770" height="308"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User segmentation and use case optimized recommenders&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ar/about-aws/whats-new/2021/11/amazon-personalize-intelligent-user-segmentation/"&gt;User segmentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon Personalize now offers intelligent user segmentation so you can run more effective prospecting campaigns through your marketing channels. By using two new recipes, you can automatically segment your users based on their interest in different product categories, brands, and more. aws-item-affinity identifies users based on their interest in individual&lt;br&gt;
items, such as movies, songs, or products. aws-item-attribute identifies users based on the attributes they care about, such as genre or price point.&lt;br&gt;
This drives higher engagement with marketing campaigns, increases retention through targeted messaging, and improves the return on investment for your marketing spend. &lt;br&gt;
For sample cost calculations, see &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/personalize/pricing/"&gt;Amazon Personalize pricing.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ar/about-aws/whats-new/2021/11/recommenders-optimized-personalized-media-entertainment-retail-amazon-personalize/"&gt;Use case optimized recommenders for retail, as well as media and entertainment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New recommenders make it faster and easier to deliver high-performing personalized user experiences. You can choose from use cases like “Frequently Bought Together,” “Because You Watched X,” “Top Picks for You,” and more. Map your data to a recommender, and Amazon Personalize chooses the optimal settings for your use case and automates the work of creating and maintaining personalized recommendations. For sample cost calculations, see &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/personalize/pricing/"&gt;Amazon Personalize pricing.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Availability&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General availability. For more information, check the &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/"&gt;AWS Regional Services&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XKhpl--4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/z3yngvyopxle3ivk2mpe.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XKhpl--4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/z3yngvyopxle3ivk2mpe.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="364"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experience Builder, Search Analytics Dashboard, Custom Document&lt;br&gt;
Enrichment&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What is it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experience Builder&lt;br&gt;
You can now deploy a fully functional and customizable search experience with Amazon Kendra in a few clicks, without any coding or machine&lt;br&gt;
learning (ML) experience. Experience Builder delivers an intuitive visual workflow to quickly build, customize, and launch your Amazon Kendra– powered search application securely on the cloud. You can start with the ready-to-use search experience template in the builder, which can be customized by simply dragging and dropping the components you want,&lt;br&gt;
such as filters or sorting. You can invite others to collaborate or test your search application for feedback, and then share the project with all users when you’re ready to deploy the experience. Amazon Kendra Experience Builder comes with AWS Single Sign On (SSO) integration that supports popular identity providers such as Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AD) and Okta ,delivering secure end-user SSO authentication while accessing the search experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Search Analytics Dashboard&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Amazon Kendra Search Analytics Dashboard allows you to better understand quality and usability metrics across your Amazon Kendra–powered search applications. The Search Analytics Dashboard helps administrators and content creators understand how easily end users are finding relevant search results, the quality of the search results, and gaps in&lt;br&gt;
the content. The dashboard provides a snapshot of how your users interact with your search application and how effective your search results are. The analytics data can be viewed in a visual dashboard in the console, or you can build your own dashboards by accessing the Search Analytics data through an API.&lt;br&gt;
The dashboard empowers you to dive deep into search&lt;br&gt;
trends and user behavior to identify insights, as well as bring clarity to potential areas of improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Custom Document Enrichment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Amazon Kendra Custom Document Enrichment capabilities, you can build a custom ingestion pipeline that pre-processes documents before they get indexed into Amazon Kendra. For example, while ingesting content from a repository like SharePoint using AWS connectors, you can enrich documents with additional metadata, convert scanned documents to text, classify documents, extract entities, and further transform the document using custom extract, transform, and load (ETL) processes. The enrichment&lt;br&gt;
is performed by simple rules that can be configured in the console or by invoking functions from AWS Lambda. These functions can optionally call other AWS artificial intelligence (AI) services such as Amazon Comprehend, Amazon Transcribe, or Amazon Textract.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Resources&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kendra"&gt;Webpage &lt;/a&gt;| &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/12/amazon-kendra-experience-builder-search-analytics-dashboard-custom-document-enrichment"&gt;Blog post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accelerate conversation design&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What is it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Amazon Lex Automated Chatbot Designer helps you design chatbots using existing conversation transcripts in hours rather than weeks. Using machine learning (ML), it can analyze thousands of lines of transcripts in a couple of hours and provide an initial bot design that includes common intents and the information needed to fulfill them. You can iterate on the bot design to deliver effective conversational experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designing conversational interfaces or chatbots is manual, time consuming, and prone to human errors. Developers often spend hundreds of hours analyzing transcripts and gathering the key information needed to design chatbots. With the Automated Chatbot Designer, you can off-load the analysis of conversation transcripts to Amazon Lex and accelerate the design of your chatbots, reduce errors, and improve your customer experience.&lt;br&gt;
You can try the Automated Chatbot Designer in Preview for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
• Reduce manual effort. Analyze thousands of lines of transcripts to discover intents and compile a list of information required to fulfill them, reducing&lt;br&gt;
manual effort in conversation design.&lt;br&gt;
• Expedite conversation design. Automatically surface an initial bot design that you can then refine to launch conversational experiences faster.&lt;br&gt;
• Improve customer experience. Help your bot understand customers better by minimizing ambiguity between intents. Ensure that intents are well defined&lt;br&gt;
and well separated to avoid frustration and improve customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Availability&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
Amazon Lex is available in 12 AWS Regions. For more information, check the &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/"&gt;AWS Regional Services&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;br&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/getrealvisitors/3-golden-tips-to-increase-click-rates-with-email-marketing-2ng9</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#click-rates-with-email-marketing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Click Rates with Email Marketing
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are various tools and methods in the field of internet marketing and digital marketing , one of the most powerful and main of which is email marketing. Especially these days its importance has become more obvious.&lt;br&gt;
If we can improve our email creation skills, we can easily overtake our competitors.&lt;br&gt;
We also need to know that email marketing has many benefits. Its advantages include cheapness, convenience and..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#click-rate"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Click rate
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/17127453-How-to-Increase-Email-CTR"&gt;Email click-through rate (CTR)&lt;/a&gt; is the ratio of the number of subscribers who clicked on at least one link in the email to the total number of emails received. It is usually expressed as a percentage.&lt;br&gt;
According to studies in the field of email marketing, 73% of marketers evaluate email click-through rate as one of the most important criteria for measuring the success of email campaigns. Because the main purpose of email marketing is to establish and maintain communication and interaction with contacts. Therefore, you should design your email campaigns in a way that can persuade your audience to click on the link in the email. When it comes to email click-through rate (CTR), all parts of an email can be effective in persuading a user to click.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#high-email-clickthrough-rate"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  High email clickthrough rate
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indicates that the email campaign was related to user interest. Your audience also interacts well with the content of the email sent, and an acceptable percentage of them take the action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#low-clickthrough-rate"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Low click-through rate
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that you need to make adjustments to future campaigns. The best way to find out if you have a good click-through rate is to compare your performance with the average of your business.&lt;br&gt;
By following a series of very simple golden tips, we can easily increase the opening rate of our sent emails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#email-marketing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  e-mail marketing
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These 3 golden methods are the most important very simple tricks that if you use them in your &lt;a href="https://www.targetedwebtraffic.com/buy/targeted-email-marketing/"&gt;targeted email marketing system&lt;/a&gt;, you will see great results to increase your click-through rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a good sense of curiosity in the reader in email marketing
The most important factor in opening an email is the curiosity of the audience. Curiosity is a very effective way and encourages the reader to click on the email. Using this method in the title of the email is very effective and increases the rate of opening the email.
For more impact, state the title and the first line in a way that makes the reader curious and makes them feel good. This will allow the user and the client to open your email.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Email subject&lt;br&gt;
Do not use titles such as "hello" and short words to increase email opening rate in email marketing. Also avoid aimless and short titles. The title of your email is very important and will attract the attention of the audience&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focus on the first line&lt;br&gt;
The best way for your email to be read by the user is how to write the first line of the email. Write the first line of your email very carefully and leave it for that time because it has a very important impact on the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use of numbers&lt;br&gt;
Using special numbers will increase the opening rate of your emails in email marketing. For example, write down the duration of a movie that you emailed for advertising. Know that using specific numbers increases the audience's curiosity.&lt;br&gt;
For example:&lt;br&gt;
• 10 ways to earn professional internet money&lt;br&gt;
• You only have until 20:30.&lt;br&gt;
• Download 6:30 minute movie&lt;br&gt;
• and…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use question sentences&lt;br&gt;
Using question sentences when sending an email to the user increases the rate of email opening, such as:&lt;br&gt;
• How to increase sales?&lt;br&gt;
Haven't seen the free movie yet?&lt;br&gt;
Why not start your own Internet business?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify user interests and audience segmentation for email marketing
If we send an email to all our contacts, if someone does not like or need the content of our email, they will not open it. Or he may be upset and change his view of our brand.
When it comes to email marketing campaigns, it's best to divide your audience into several categories. Send emails to each category based on their interests and needs. Not only does this make them more willing, but it can also increase the click-through rate of the email sent. Having a call-to-action bar in the email will increase the number of customers coming to our website .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, suppose you are very interested in pizza, if every week, a 60% discount is sent to your Inbox by your favorite pizza shop, would you not want to open the whole email ?! The answer to this question will definitely be positive.&lt;br&gt;
One of the most effective tricks to increase clickthrough rate is to monitor the interests of each of your users. This method is very simple. You will definitely receive an email or phone number from your buyers.&lt;br&gt;
Track what products and services users provide, and organize and categorize people who are interested in a particular category of your products.&lt;br&gt;
You can then design an email text for each user according to their taste and interest. Or just send emails and suggestions that the person is more interested in receiving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e-mail marketing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also read this article: Why do businesses need digital marketing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customize your emails
Try to be intimate with your audience in the content of email marketing, so that the person feels that this email is designed just for him and after receiving the email, he will feel good. This creates a sense of worth in the person.
Suppose you receive an email from a reputable company with the subject line:
"Mohammad Jan, you have not yet received your 50% discount code ?!"
The person becomes curious to open the email, then reads the contents of the email. It feels valuable to be targeted by a reputable brand and company. This is etched in the recipient's mind and increases the likelihood of the email being reopened.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion&lt;br&gt;
According to the golden and practical tips of email marketing mentioned above, you can have successful email marketing campaigns. As a result, you will have the highest return with the least cost. Email marketing is one of the most powerful digital marketing tools that plays a role today. It is important in increasing sales and attracting specific audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>7 Steps to Reduce Code Smell 🦨</title>
      <author>Conor Bronsdon</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 17:45:17 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/linearb/7-steps-to-reduce-code-smell-2pjh</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/linearb/7-steps-to-reduce-code-smell-2pjh</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Code smell is a way to describe code that hasn’t aged well and has the potential for a lot of issues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It usually is the source of a lot of hot fixes or workarounds keeping it functional. My most common reflex is to rewrite it. However, if I’m not careful, I’ll waste an entire day and not improve anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a decade of programming, here are my 7 steps to reduce code smell gradually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-0-admit-there-is-a-problem"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 0: Admit there is a problem
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I start to recognize my code is smelly when I start saying things like “that time only took an hour.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m usually doing something simple, like adding another field to a form or another schedule for a customer. I quickly add in code because it feels like the easiest thing to do and ship the feature. There are so many other things on my plate, I don’t have time for this, I’ll say to myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the 5th or 6th hour I’ve hacked the same spot, I realize, had I rewritten it sooner, I would have actually saved time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-1-identify-spots-to-clean"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 1: Identify spots to clean
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smelly code is so disorganized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it really smelly or do I just not understand it? It’s very tempting to always default to a rewrite. If I write all the code, I’ll understand it. But who is to say the next person who looks at it will?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to profiling code to identify the slowest spot, I work to identify the place that smells the most. Are there sections of the code that new devs are always struggling with? Are there frequent small changes that require touching lots of different files or methods?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a list of smelly code helps identify which sections of code need the most attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-2-pick-the-worst-spot"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 2: Pick the worst spot
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smelly code is like dirty dishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a stack of dishes, I’ll plug my nose until I dispose of the rotting food that’s causing the stink. It was easy to blame the whole pile, but for the most part, all of the other dishes are fairly clean. They don’t need immediate attention. The rotting smell came from something I forgot to clean off when I was in a hurry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When there is a piece of code that’s really rotten, it’s often hidden somewhere in the pile. Maybe an abstraction went too far, spreading a hundred lines of code across dozens of files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BasXM8HK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8kxhd27wtfo5s8bcniyx.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BasXM8HK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8kxhd27wtfo5s8bcniyx.png" alt="Stinky, smelly code" width="751" height="917"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep in mind that I need to fix the worst smell; most of the other code is good enough and doesn’t need my immediate attention. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-3-resist-the-urge-to-do-everything"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 3: Resist the urge to do everything
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smelly code is never-ending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the hardest part of improving a code base is scoping it to one thing. It’s so liberating to finally get a chance to clean up, that I can easily take it too far. I’ll think, “While I’m at it, I might as well clean up this… oh! and that other thing needs fixing too.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resist!&lt;/strong&gt; Do not do everything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I try to tackle everything, I’m not going to finish. Even more likely, it’s not going to pass code review. It’s better to do one piece at a time - ya know, like eating an elephant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-4-make-sure-its-better"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 4: Make sure it’s better
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smelly code has edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inevitably, in the process of rewriting, I discover why the code was written that way in the first place. I might even stumble across a can of worms. At that point, I realize my not-so-dimwitted co-worker wasn’t as dumb as I thought (or even more likely, I discover I was the one who wrote the code originally 🤦‍♂️).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After learning all the edge cases, I’ll be tempted to walk away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-5-dont-immediately-give-up"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 5: Don’t immediately give up
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smelly code is messy to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m frustrated imagining how far away the current code is from a better solution. I’ve got the code in my head, I know the edge cases, and I’ve got the context. It’s important not to give up as the solution may be right around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_JGl2-QF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dmoey7npex87r38arcga.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_JGl2-QF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dmoey7npex87r38arcga.png" alt="Mount Codeverest" width="880" height="473"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep thinking about it while I go for a walk. Maybe even take a break. Solutions often come to me while I’m on walks or in the shower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-6-use-the-coworker-bobblehead"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 6: Use the co-worker bobblehead
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smelly code needs attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I steal my co-worker’s bobblehead and explain aloud what I’m doing. In the process, I figure out what I've missed or overlooked. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a bobble head isn’t available, I resort to using my actual co-workers. (I’m checking my assumptions by walking them through what I’m thinking step by step.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-7-publish-or-throw-in-the-towel"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 7: Publish or throw in the towel
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smelly code can improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of my steps I have a complete solution or I’m banging my head on the keyboard. If it’s the first, I push the change and take a breath of fresh air. If it’s the second, I commit it to a branch and plan to revisit another day. Sometimes we can’t have nice things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#rinse-and-repeat"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Rinse and repeat
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The depth I go into each step changes based on complexity or how critical the code is. Sometimes I can run through each of the steps in a few minutes, other times it’s spread out over a few weeks. It really depends on what I’m working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running through these steps helps me gradually improve my code. There’s nothing better than finally getting a fix for some smelly code merged and into production. Sometimes we can have nice things.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Relational VS Non-Relational Databases</title>
      <author>Aulad Himel</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 17:35:50 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/auladhimel/relational-vs-non-relational-databases-4mpn</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/auladhimel/relational-vs-non-relational-databases-4mpn</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For storing data of application choosing the right database is very important. Sometimes choosing the relational database might seem more natural but sometimes this choice may not be successful. Here I am trying to explain the differences between relational and non-relational databases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#relational-database"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Relational Database&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A relational database organizes data into one or more tables which consists of columns and rows. All data is organized in the table where columns indicate attributes and every row indicates a single data item which is called records. In simple words, All the information in Relational Database is structured and is organized in tables. Here the primary key is something that identifies each item uniquely and a primary key can contain one or more columns of a table. Different tables can establish relations between them by different foreign keys. SQL is used for executing queries, retrieve data, and editing data. It is used for communicating with a Relational Database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages of Relational Database&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A relational database is great for structured data. And it uses an existing query language (SQL) for making the relation between them. It can handle lots of complex queries and database transactions of data as here data in tables are very well connected by using unique keys. It is great for complex queries and it has easy data navigation. For a high level of data integration transactions are secure and it is very high reliability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantages of Relational Databases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It has an up-front schema definition that means it has to maintain schema always. Here Relational Database has no adaptation to changing requirements. For that dynamic changes can affect all the other items in the same table and here data processing is slow. For getting high-performance expensive hardware is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#nonrelational-database"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Non-Relational Database&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A non-relational database refers to a database that has no tabular schema of rows and columns. It maintains an optimized storage model which is very flexible. &lt;br&gt;
It is also known as a NoSQL database that means “Not Only SQL”. The Meaning of that line is you don't need to use just SQL only to query the database, you can use any language which you prefer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages of Non-Relational Database&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Non-Relational Databases are designed for use with low-cost commodity hardware. Here huge volumes of data can be easily handled. It can be easily installed in cheap commodity hardware. That means we can process and store more data within less cost. Non-Relational databases need no schemas.  Non-Relational databases technologies have excellent integrated caching capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantages of Non-Relational Database&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Non-Relational databases don’t have reliability functions. It is not compatible with SQL. We need a manual query language that makes things slower and more complex. It is less stable and may have fewer functionalities compared with a relational database.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Complete Guide Of ALL HTML tags</title>
      <author>elinabey</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 17:13:15 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/elinabey/the-complete-guide-of-all-html-tags-51o9</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/elinabey/the-complete-guide-of-all-html-tags-51o9</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--I8ZCbrW2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q0goz94xmucb8iehflhs.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--I8ZCbrW2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q0goz94xmucb8iehflhs.jpg" alt="Complete Guide Of ALL HTML tags" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Complete Guide Of HTML tags, in a single tutorial, you will learn All HTML Tags with examples. HTML tags like a keyword that describes how the web browser will display the content. With the help of HTML tags, A Browser can differentiate the HTML content and simple content. However, HTML tags having three important parts:&lt;br&gt;
Opening tag &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;  closing &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag and content. But many HTML tags are unclosed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An HTML Document/Page must have some vital HTML tags in which a web browser can distinguish between simple and HTML content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#html-ltgt-tag"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  HTML &amp;lt;!--...--&amp;gt; Tag
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!--This is a comment. Comments are not displayed in the browser--&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#html-ltdoctypegt-declaration"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  HTML &amp;lt;!DOCTYPE&amp;gt; Declaration
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;The content of the document......&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#html-raw-ltagt-endraw-tag"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  HTML &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; Tag
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://www.softcodeon.com"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Soft Codeon!&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  HTML &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;abbr&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;  and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;acronym&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; Tag
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;The abbr element&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Using &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;abbr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;title=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Learn HTML"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;HTML&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/abbr&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; is fun and easy!&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;The acronym element&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
Can I get this &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;acronym&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;title=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Learn HTML"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;HTML Guide&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/acronym&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;?
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Note:&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; The acronym element is not supported in HTML5.&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;These three elements are use to create a description list:&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;dl&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;dt&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Coffee&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/dt&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;dd&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;White cold drink&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/dd&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

      <title>Single Service or Container </title>
      <author>Ashutosh Singh</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 17:11:02 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/aws-builders/single-service-or-container-581b</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#you-guessed-it-right-containerdocker"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  You Guessed it Right Container/Docker
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever you wanna call it, I call it Docker mostly 😉.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lets-discuss-why"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Let's discuss &lt;strong&gt;WHY&lt;/strong&gt;?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why we needed something like docker (if know about docker if not just wait)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;nswer to the above question can be explained by the simple line you might have heard about it !!&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;strong&gt;"It works in my machine"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
so back then we don't have any clear or precise answer that can satisfy someone need, but now we have and it called as &lt;strong&gt;Docker or Containerization&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a very simple words suppose you have written a piece of code and you want to &lt;strong&gt;send&lt;/strong&gt; it to &lt;strong&gt;someone else without breaking the code or environment&lt;/strong&gt; in which you're running it you need to pack your code in a docker image or container image that you can send in zip or upload to the registry like &lt;strong&gt;DockerHub&lt;/strong&gt;, just like GitHub. And then just give them the url.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like something this 👇👇👇&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uDpo8dvn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wmmtz74kt34ct30pcs6v.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uDpo8dvn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wmmtz74kt34ct30pcs6v.PNG" alt="Image description" width="880" height="460"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You can create the account and get started with it's free upto some limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can even download the Docker for you OS more info &lt;a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And from their documentation you can learn the basic command and usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-i-named-this-blog-as-single-service"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why I named this blog as Single service
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically We are supposed to be or it is required to run only single program, single thing, only 1 service inside a container.&lt;br&gt;
And that's the most powerful thing my friend !! you might ask why ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supposed you're running something inside docker container that was compromised or hacked so attacker will only be able to access that single container not the whole system because it's running standalone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not going to much detail coz then it will be a whole lot burden 😅  even if you want to learn about this just google about it and you'll find the answer. TRUST ME JUST DO IT!! 🔥🔥🔥&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-does-aws-offer-with-dockercontainer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What does AWS offer with Docker/Container?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's the reason I'm here for 😎😎😎&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ill-mention-only-few-of-the-services-as-its-easy-for-me"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  I'll mention only few of the services as it's easy for me😉😉.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ECS&lt;/strong&gt; Elastic Container Services, why elastic ?? it can expand as much as you want that's why!&lt;br&gt;
So it's a bunch of services together we call it ECS like ECR, fargate, and the (K8s) cluster services, hmmm strange I thought there were more but okay we can do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again what does this ECR is it's called Elastic Container Registry, remember about DockerHub like GitHub it the same but only as AWS services and a couple of differences about their working, simple words we can save our image over there and share them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fargate!!&lt;/strong&gt; It's a serverless service for Kubernetes Cluster or whatever you wanna call it, but it's using the containers that's for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if we go deep inside we discover there are bunch of services or term that we need to understand for that I'll be writing a How-to-blog so stay tuned&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: Somethings that I'm not mentioning like scaling, managed or not, pricing etc are not really part of this blog as these are just to give a general idea of the services so forgive me about tha t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#so-my-friends-this-is-it-about-the-containers-and-aws-service"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  So, my friends this is it about the Containers and AWS service
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That uses the Containers as their major components, there are some-others too but as you are just learning these services are enough for you for now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What is Custom Hook?</title>
      <author>Md Farid Hossain</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 17:02:34 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/developerfarid/what-is-custom-hook-30ab</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/developerfarid/what-is-custom-hook-30ab</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Custom Hook?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Custom Hook is a JavaScript function which we create by ourselves, when we want to share logic between other JavaScript functions. It allows you to reuse some piece of code in several parts of your app.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;When and How to Use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When we want to share the logic between other components, we can extract it to a separate function. According to official documents, the custom hook has to:&lt;br&gt;
start with the key word use&lt;br&gt;
call other hooks&lt;br&gt;
Because custom hook is a JS function, the Rules of Hooks apply to it as well. Those are:&lt;br&gt;
Never call Hooks from inside a loop, condition or nested function&lt;br&gt;
Hooks should sit at the top-level of your component&lt;br&gt;
Only call Hooks from React functional components&lt;br&gt;
Never call a Hook from a regular function&lt;br&gt;
Hooks can call other Hooks&lt;br&gt;
How to Create Custom Hook?&lt;br&gt;
You create the hook same way as you create any JS function. Look at it as a refactoring of code into another function to make it reusable. It will speed up your productivity and save your time.&lt;br&gt;
Let's consider the following example, where we have useEffect()hook which updates the document title:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import {useState, useEffect } from 'react';

    export const Counter=()=&amp;gt; {
      const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
      const incrementCount = () =&amp;gt; setCount(count + 1);
      useEffect(() =&amp;gt; {
        document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`
      });

      return (
        &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You clicked {count} times&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;button onClick={incrementCount}&amp;gt;ClickMe&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
      )
    }

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What we want to do is to create a custom hook, which accepts a piece of text and updates the document title for us. Here is how we do that:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const useDocumentTitle = (title) =&amp;gt; {
        useEffect(() =&amp;gt; {
          document.title = title;
        }, [title])
      }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our useDocumentHook() now accepts the string and calls useEffect() hook inside, which updates the document title with a given title, when the title was changed (we pass title as dependency here).&lt;br&gt;
So our final code would look like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

const useDocumentTitle = (title) =&amp;gt; {
  useEffect(() =&amp;gt; {
    document.title = title;
  }, [title]);
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;export const Counter = () =&amp;gt; {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const incrementCount = () =&amp;gt; setCount(count + 1);
  useDocumentTitle(`You clicked ${count} times`);

  return (
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You clicked {count} times&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;button onClick={incrementCount}&amp;gt;Click me&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
  );
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And that is all, as simple as that :) In my next blog post I'll share 5 the most commonly used custom hooks, which make your development faster and easier.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Scoping in JavaScript</title>
      <author>vaishnav</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 16:45:22 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/vaishnav/scoping-in-javascript-explained-1m6p</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/vaishnav/scoping-in-javascript-explained-1m6p</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article we will cover one of the most important concepts in JavaScript, that is, ‘scope’. Scope defines the availability of variables and introduces the idea of local and global variables. Understanding scope will allow you to reduce unexpected errors and more reusable code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-scope"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is scope?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current context of execution. Scope determines the visibility of variables. In JavaScript there are 3 types of scopes, namely: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Block scope&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Function scope&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global scope&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#block-scope"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Block scope
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to ES6, we only had two types of scopes, function and local scope. ES6 introduced two new keywords &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt;. These two keywords provide block scoping in JavaScript. In block scoping, all variables declared inside a &lt;code&gt;{ }&lt;/code&gt; block cannot be accessed outside the block.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;John&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 'name' and 'age' are not available here&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This feature cannot be practiced using var&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;John&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 'name' can be accessed from here&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#function-scope"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Function scope
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All variables declared inside the function, cannot be accessed outside that function. This means that the variable have local scope as they are local to that function&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;James&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 'name' cannot be accessed from here&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This allows us to declare a new variable with same name outside the function.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;James&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Jack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All function (local) variables are born when they are declared and deleted when the function is completed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Function arguments (parameters) act as local variables inside the function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#global-scope"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Global scope
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Variables that are declared outside the function have global scope. That is, they are available anywhere in the JS program.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 20&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Any variable that is assigned a value without declaring it, is automatically a global variable. However, this is not possible while in ‘strict mode’.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Jack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a web browser, all global variables are deleted when you close the browser window or tab. With JavaScript, global scope is the JavaScript file itself. In HTML, a variable is said to have global scope when it is in the window object. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global variables must be defined with a var keyword for it to be included in the window object.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 20&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;45&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// undefined&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: It is advised not to create global variables as your global variable can overwrite your window variable and your local variables can overwrite your global variables. This can lead to a lot of confusion and inefficient code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#wrapping-up"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Wrapping up
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any large or small project must have variables to store and manipulate data. By understanding scoping you can reduce the stress of working with JavaScript to some extent and it can also help you in avoiding those small errors that sometimes eats your brain up!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CSS Transformations</title>
      <author>Md Farid Hossain</author>

      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#css-transformations"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  CSS Transformations
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSS transformations can be split into two categories, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. We’ll look at two-dimensional transformations first. Two-dimensional CSS transformations operate on the X (horizontal) and Y (vertical) axes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSS Transform: Translate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The translate() method translates, or moves, a page element up, down, left, and/or right on the page by a specified amount. In the parenthesis, the first number specifies the horizontal distance, and the second number specifies the vertical distance.&lt;br&gt;
For example, we can translate our div by a number of pixels:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;transform: translate(100px, 75px);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;TranslateX():&lt;br&gt;
In addition to translate(), we also have the translateX() and translateY() methods. translateX() moves an element only horizontally, and takes one argument:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;transform: translateX(100px);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;TranslateY():&lt;br&gt;
Similarly, the translateY() method moves an element vertically. It also takes just one argument:transform: translateY(100px);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSS Transform: Scale&lt;br&gt;
The scale() method changes the size of the target element. If we provide one argument, this increases or decreases the size of our div by a multiple of its original size:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;transform: scale(2);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CSS Transform: Rotate&lt;br&gt;
The rotate() function, as you might guess, rotates an element. By default, the element will rotate around its center. We can specify the rotation in terms of degrees, radians, or turns (from 0turn to 1turn):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;transform: rotate(45deg);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CSS Transform: Skew&lt;br&gt;
The skew() method skews, or slants, an element along its X and/or Y axes. Its arguments specify the horizontal and vertical angle of the skew, respectively.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;transform: skew(50deg, -15deg);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CSS transform-origin Property&lt;br&gt;
transform-origin is another CSS property that can be used with transform. The transform-origin property changes the position of the origin, the point where the transformation starts or is based around.&lt;br&gt;
This is most clearly demonstrated with the rotate() method: We can use transform-origin to move the center point of rotation:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;transform: rotate(45deg);  transform-origin: top left;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CSS Transform: Perspective&lt;br&gt;
The perspective() value sets the depth of the element on the Z-axis. It toggles how “close” or “far away” the element appears. perspective() is used in conjunction with other 3D transformation methods, as we’ll see next.&lt;br&gt;
CSS Transform: rotateX() and rotateY()&lt;br&gt;
Like rotate(), the rotateX() and rotateY() values rotate our div, but “around” the X and Y-axes:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;transform: perspective(500px) rotateY(40deg);
transform: perspective(500px) rotateY(60deg); 
transform: perspective(500px) rotateY(80deg);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>I wrote a distributed ZeroTier like things in three weeks</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I am working with my soon 4 years old project called ArozOS in my spare time. If you didn't read my previous post about ArozOS, it is a web desktop system designed for cloud / private server environments. You can read more in the link below: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="ltag__link"&gt;

      &lt;h2&gt;I write my own web desktop OS for 3 years and this is what it looks like now&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;Toby Chui ・ Apr 4 ・ 9 min read&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;div class="ltag__link__taglist"&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#webdev&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#go&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#linux&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#ux&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In a chat session with my coauthor from US, we discuss the possibility of implementing a way to connect multiple ArozOS nodes (mostly Raspberry Pis) into a large storage and compute pool. But as ArozOS has some design guidelines like no 3rd party run-time dependencies and all core system must be static and fail safe, this makes it not possible to work with existing solutions. So this is where this project kicks off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-not-zerotier-or-vpn"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why not ZeroTier or VPN?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of my dev friends see this project will ask me this question. In fact, ZeroTier, Hamachi or other SDWAN solutions can provide the answer for my use case easily if it was not designed to run under the ArozOS project. The problem with ZeroTier and others is that they relies on a central server and runs on a tree network structure. These structures are not designed to prevent single point of failure (SPOF), they are designed to increase the user dependencies on their services. So, I need to implement my own to solve this issue without relying on structure that contains SPOF. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--or44JFhx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ov1wwdanrrybtskghvx6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--or44JFhx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ov1wwdanrrybtskghvx6.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="174"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go implementation of the Routing ID based Distributed Dynamic Domain Name Service&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no such standard as DDDNS and this is not a DDNS protocol. I drafted this experiment myself to test if it is possible to create a clusters that "floats" on the floating IP assigned by the ISP or in a network environment that can only allow plug-and-play hosting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The requirement of this project is as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The software cannot get IP address from its NIC, or using any kind of commands that request OS to provide the IP address information (e.g. No ip a or ifconfig)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No external dependencies other than the connected nodes (e.g. no UPnP to ask router what is the current node IP, no online IP checking API)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No platform dependencies (aka it should not be only working on Linux)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the ip address information has to be come from…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="gh-btn-container"&gt;&lt;a class="gh-btn" href="https://github.com/tobychui/go-DDDNS"&gt;View on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-this"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What Is This?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project was code-named go-DDDNS (I should rename it to something else later as it is technically not a DNS, but for now please stick with this first), it is a distributed, no Single Point of Failure implementation of a routing ID based IP resolver for a cluster of nodes "floating on the sea of internet".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you want to connect a few computers together is you need to know where to find them. "Where" in term of the internet is IP address. So I would need to create a way for all the nodes within the network to know their reachable IPs. This is easy as in daily implementations, you can always just send a GET request to AWS web service or &lt;a href="https://api.ipify.org"&gt;IPIFY.org&lt;/a&gt; and let the 3rd party server return your public IP address. As mentioned, ArozOS do not allow run-time 3rd party dependencies. So I need to design a protocol for each nodes to know its public IP address from other connected nodes. And this is what I came up with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-it-works"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How it Works?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setup
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This part was not actually related to the algorithm. Just before heart beat of nodes happens, each nodes exchange their TOTP secret over HTTPS to make sure the sender and receiver are both registered to each other, just a tiny security feature, but worth mentioning here. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EeE_3vmk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dhhb4jqq3e2tb6nkms4h.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EeE_3vmk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dhhb4jqq3e2tb6nkms4h.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="626"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#heartbeat"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Heartbeat
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heartbeat is commonly used in automatic fail-over systems where two server nodes, usually one primary and one secondary, keep heart-beating to each other to make sure the other node is online. In case of a heart beat request failed, the other node will replace the first node and continue serving your requests. However, heart beating to a remote node would also carries information of the request routing, like the source IP. Hence, by utilizing the source IP field in the packet, we can know where the request was sent from. After the remote nodes analysis the sender's (public) IP address, the remote node will return the sender IP address as seen from the remote node to the sender, and now we got a public IP address returned!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5fIIQmQH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ylxkt4522m5tg80jp1kx.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5fIIQmQH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ylxkt4522m5tg80jp1kx.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="602"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#oh-wait-dynamic-ip-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Oh Wait, Dynamic IP !?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the world is running low in IPv4 address, ISP now serving their clients with dynamic IP address. So in order to handle IP change of nodes that is set-up using home networks, the protocol need to handle IP changing and updating as well. Luckily, as the heart beat is purely implemented based on remote node's view point of sender node's IP address, if the sender node's IP changed, the remote node also get the updated IP address of the sender node just by looking at its packet header. So IP change of a particular node in the network wont' be a big problem.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KlR5OWwf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pg3v3utokr33umb2rsse.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KlR5OWwf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pg3v3utokr33umb2rsse.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="872"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a quick demo video showcasing a node changing IP during run time and the other node is able to catch the IP update in next cycle (10 second) and update the heartbeat endpoint. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qnpuubt70I4"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#oh-wait-two-node-ip-change-at-the-same-time"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Oh Wait, Two node IP change at the same time!??
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However when you got more nodes, IP changing might occur in the same heartbeat cycle on multiple nodes. And based on the above method of updating IP address based on heart beat request, there might be a situation where two nodes, in which the two nodes change IP at the same time / within the same heartbeat cycle, will never able to reach each other again as both node's heart beat is not reachable on both side. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hKhLwQ9c--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5ob1z9mfkatv0ncrx7cv.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hKhLwQ9c--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5ob1z9mfkatv0ncrx7cv.png" alt="Image description" width="742" height="342"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, that is why a synchronization protocol is added in the module. After a fixed number of retries (Might change this to a random range instead later for better performance), it will try to get the "lost node" IP address from a randomly picked nearby static nodes (a node which IP didn't change recently) / most recently online node. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---RinXODk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zyj6kkc4wekyhix2o3ox.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---RinXODk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zyj6kkc4wekyhix2o3ox.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="1067"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way, after a few cycles of iterations, the lost node should established an updated IP address and heartbeat connection to the "static node", where the two IP changing node can update their "lost node" IP address from the "static nodes"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a short video demonstrating 3 nodes, where 2 nodes IP are manually changed at the same time during run time.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UcgDCWygO2Q"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, both nodes grab the other's IP address after a few retry count, and successful continue the heart beat process with an updated IP address. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-next"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What Next?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess the next stage for this project is add NAT node support via websocket / other dual way communication protocols as well as supporting iterative registration of nodes (i.e. register node E on node A will also register the node E on B, C, D nodes using iterative logic). Right now it can only track IP address of network nodes, but later I hope I can continue build on top of this project and create a transport layer and add clustering features to my ArozOS projects :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no such standard as DDDNS and this is not a DDNS protocol. I drafted this experiment myself to test if it is possible to create a clusters that "floats" on the floating IP assigned by the ISP or in a network environment that can only allow plug-and-play hosting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The requirement of this project is as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The software cannot get IP address from its NIC, or using any kind of commands that request OS to provide the IP address information (e.g. No ip a or ifconfig)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No external dependencies other than the connected nodes (e.g. no UPnP to ask router what is the current node IP, no online IP checking API)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No platform dependencies (aka it should not be only working on Linux)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the ip address information has to be come from…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
