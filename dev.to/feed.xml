      <description>&lt;p&gt;We live in a world where progress is king - complete tasks, meet goals, commit more, deploy frequently, ship faster. But what happens when something is lurking in the codebase that’s holding you back? That’s right, legacy code. Let’s take a look at how you can deal with legacy code, once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This guide will cover the following topics👇&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is legacy code?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The characteristics of legacy code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The problem of legacy code and technical debt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tips and tools for working effectively with legacy code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legacy code migration and cultural shift&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resources for dealing with legacy code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-legacy-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is legacy code?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we talk about legacy code, your first thought might be of old, obsolete code. Yes, it may be written for operating systems that are no longer supported. However, it may also mean code which is: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inherited code: it may be from another developer, team, or older software version.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code that the original developer no longer maintains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A code base that is no longer engineered but continually patched. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legacy code can also refer to unsupported operating systems, hardware and formats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-characteristics-of-legacy-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The characteristics of legacy code.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/websites/web-development/what-is-legacy-code/"&gt;Ionis characterises&lt;/a&gt; legacy code as “the antithesis of clean code which is easy to understand, maintain, and adapt. Legacy code is unwieldy, outdated, and messy, which can lead to numerous problems.” It’s typically resistant to bug finding through automated tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/what-is-legacy-code-is-it-code-without-tests/"&gt;Nicolas Carlo&lt;/a&gt; calls legacy code code you’re not comfortable changing but also “valuable code you’re afraid to change” and “the code you need to change, and you struggle to understand.” He suggests that you may, in fact, be responsible for “that code you wrote because you can’t remember the hell you had in mind when you did. Yes, our past self often makes silly mistakes. (If you ever need a good reason for great documentation, this is it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-problems-of-legacy-code-and-technical-debt"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The problems of legacy code and technical debt
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes legacy code exists for a reason. It may point to a team with a crazy high turnover, making little effort in their documentation. Or a team of more experienced developers who are comfortable with older languages. A company may keep legacy code due to competitive advantages over other businesses. They may fear that rewriting code may introduce new bugs or remove hidden functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, legacy code may also operate in a black box that is less accessible to a broader development community, meaning insufficient quality improvement, security, and maintainability. When people leave, it may be hard to find new developers appropriately skilled to work with it. As time goes on, the code may struggle to work with new and emerging apps and hardware. The company risks falling behind and is drowning in technical debt. Do you hate legacy code?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ivo Lukač did a survey which &lt;a href="https://netgen.io/blog/how-to-cope-with-legacy-code-and-technical-debt"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; over half of the respondents would rather not work on it, and an additional 11% hate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7Z-XUkwZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/w37xr8al4ie3juqs8mrk.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7Z-XUkwZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/w37xr8al4ie3juqs8mrk.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, their pain points are many, with spaghetti code and fear of breaking something the most common concerns followed by the frustration of sticking to depreciated technology. This survey offers an insight into the complexities of dealing with legacy code and explains some of the reasons developers prioritise other work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intrinsic to legacy code is technical debt - each time the code changes hands, it needs more and more features and bug fixing, all of which is time-consuming and frustrating, and the amount of technical debt continues to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hI9g8XzM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8ag5szk05rbdt7o7fycg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hI9g8XzM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8ag5szk05rbdt7o7fycg.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="#tips-and-tools-for-working-effectively-with-legacy-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tips and tools for working effectively with legacy code
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When working with legacy code, time and energy is precious and you need to know where to concentrate your efforts. Planning and purpose are critical - you need to know what can be changed and what to ignore. Fortunately, there’s plenty of tools available to make life easier:‍&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#static-code-analysis%E2%80%8D"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Static code analysis‍
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Static code analysis is the process of debugging by examining source code before a program is run. Code is analyzed against a set (or multiple sets) of coding rules. Then you get a diagnosis report of any violations of these rules based on their severity. This helps you prioritise the most urgent or important tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, static code analysis is a good practice even beyond legacy code. It creates the opportunity to identify and eliminate code defects before code is pushed for functional QA, saving a lot of later pain and reducing technical debt. Some examples of static code tools:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.grammatech.com/products/source-code-analysis"&gt;Code sonar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
• &lt;a href="https://www.castsoftware.com/glossary/static-analysis-tool"&gt;CAST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
• &lt;a href="http://www.klocwork.com/capabilities/static-code-analysis"&gt;Klocwork&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
• &lt;a href="https://www.sonarqube.org/"&gt;SonarQube‍&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of IDEs that are used for code refactoring already use static analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#code-refactoring-legacy-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Code refactoring legacy code
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.stepsize.com/blog/the-ultimate-engineers-guide-to-refactoring"&gt;Code refactoring&lt;/a&gt; is one way to deal with legacy code. It’s about overhauling code to make it more understandable, maintainable and adaptable through optimizing code, simplifying and merging variables and classes and rewriting command methods. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://martinfowler.com/aboutMe.html"&gt;Martin Fowler&lt;/a&gt;, author of two books on refactoring, explains:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;”Refactoring is the process of changing a software system in such a way that it does not alter the external behavior of the code yet improves its internal structure. It is a disciplined way to clean up code that minimizes the chances of introducing bugs. In essence, when you refactor you are improving the design of the code after it has been written.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, you can only begin refactoring once it is clear how the code works - and doesn’t work. The code is then optimized piece by piece. Any unnecessary code is removed or rewritten. Classes and variables in the code are simplified and merged. Command methods are adapted and rewritten. In the end, refactoring is basically a general overhaul of the legacy code. The resulting code is easier to understand, maintain, and adapt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers should test code after refactoring to check for any breaks. Continuous integration is useful as it enables you to revert to a previous build if something goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#add-context-to-your-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Add context to your code
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bit.ly/3hi3DiB"&gt;Stepsize VS Code&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://bit.ly/3gZ6OeF"&gt;JetBrains extensions&lt;/a&gt; help Engineering teams gain actionable insights into their technical debt, including those caused by legacy code. Engineers can track debt, add bookmarks, and organise their TODOs in their code editor, plus see the impact of technical debt and prioritise it &lt;a href="https://bit.ly/3AdAPAo"&gt;in the webapp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZZU7Y0PZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3crkhnr721fl2fhq9cmd.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZZU7Y0PZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3crkhnr721fl2fhq9cmd.gif" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#legacy-code-migration-and-cultural-shift"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Legacy code migration and cultural shift
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s increased interest in migrating legacy systems to low code development platforms. Sylvain Leroy wrote a succinct but in-depth &lt;a href="https://dzone.com/articles/how-to-do-a-legacy-software-migration-a-successful-1"&gt;guide to legacy software migration&lt;/a&gt; a few years back that’s worth a read. There are also practices like migrating desktop or on-premise data centres to the cloud and the shift from monoliths to microservices. While discussing all of these in great detail is beyond the scope of this article, it’s important to explore these trends in regard to cultural change and company culture:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do developers collaborate?&lt;br&gt;
 How is knowledge passed down from developer to developer?&lt;br&gt;
 What efforts are made to retain knowledge when someone leaves? &lt;br&gt;
What are the company standards for documentation and who ensures they are met? &lt;br&gt;
How does the company prioritise time spent dealing with technical debt? What incentives do they offer (especially important if everyone hates doing it: maybe they need to provide more time off or bring in specialists? &lt;br&gt;
How do you ensure that the new code is clean and error-free from here on? What about training and development?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;

      <title>Running Weblogic Server when connected to VPN</title>
      <author>Ravi Nagubandi</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2021 12:17:20 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/naguban123/running-weblogic-server-when-connected-to-vpn-1l4o</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/naguban123/running-weblogic-server-when-connected-to-vpn-1l4o</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of my development work, I tried to run my Weblogic Server when I am connected to VPN network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weblogic server failed with error saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(thread=Cluster, member=n/a): Delaying formation of a new cluster; unicast networking appears to be inoperable on interface as this process isn't receiving even its own transmissions; consider forcing IPv4 via -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can resolve this error by setting a JAVA_OPTIONS in setDomainEnv.cmd file located in \bin folder. The setting is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;set JAVA_OPTIONS=%JAVA_OPTIONS% -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the weblogic server starts without any issue when connected to VPN Network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Learning!!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Debug Selenium Tests in Docker using VNC Viewer</title>
      <author>Dilpreet Johal</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2021 12:04:32 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/automationbro/debug-selenium-tests-in-docker-using-vnc-viewer-59nj</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/automationbro/debug-selenium-tests-in-docker-using-vnc-viewer-59nj</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://dev.to/automationbro/selenium-docker-tutorial-4dkg"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, we learned how to integrate Selenium tests with Docker. In this tutorial, we will take a look at how to integrate VNC Viewer with Docker and debug Selenium tests in Docker using VNC Viewer. We will also learn why it's important to run tests through VNC Viewer as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-run-selenium-tests-in-docker-using-vnc%C2%A0viewer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why run Selenium tests in Docker using VNC viewer?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally, when I was preparing this post, I was going to name the title "View Selenium Tests in Docker using VNC Viewer". Because I thought the goal is to be able to view the tests running in VNC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the main reason we want to view tests in VNC viewer is to be able to debug any test issues that are happening inside the Docker. Typically, when tests are being triggered inside Docker container, you are not able to see anything that's happening inside. But, with the help of the VNC viewer, you get a visual representation of exactly what's going on inside Docker which makes it easier to debug your test issues. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prerequisite"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Prerequisite
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Install a VNC client&lt;/strong&gt;: the one I am using in this tutorial is the RealVNC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Use Selenium Debug images&lt;/strong&gt;: to be able to see what's going inside the Docker container, you will need to use an image that has a VNC server installed. Any image that ends with &lt;code&gt;-debug&lt;/code&gt; will have a VNC server installed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Map external VNC port to the Docker VNC port (5900)&lt;/strong&gt;: when you will run the docker image you will need to map the local VNC port to Docker VNC port (5900)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#run-selenium-standalone-debug-docker%C2%A0image%C2%A0"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Run Selenium Standalone Debug Docker image 
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's run the selenium/standalone-chrome-debug image and map the VNC port with it -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run -d -p 4444:4444 -p 5900:5900 --shm-size=2g selenium/standalone-chrome-debug:3.141.59-20210607&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;-p 4444:4444 is the port for your local machine mapping to Docker Selenium server port 4444&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;-p 5900:5900 is the port for your local VNC server mapping to Docker VNC server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#open-real-vnc%C2%A0client"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Open Real VNC client
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a docker image running mapped to port 5900, we can open that port in VNC viewer. To do that, open up the RealVNC client and type in the URL - &lt;code&gt;127.0.0.1:5900&lt;/code&gt;, and hit Enter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When prompted for a password, type &lt;code&gt;secret&lt;/code&gt; and continue. &lt;br&gt;
VNC server pointed to port 5900&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--P-EAQGgz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xm3fb6feimdjb8wvhz2d.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--P-EAQGgz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xm3fb6feimdjb8wvhz2d.png" alt="realvnc"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#run-tests-in%C2%A0docker"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Run tests in Docker
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it's time to run tests in Docker, make sure your tests are pointed to port 4444 as that is what we have set up for our docker container (you can check out my previous post to learn more about that). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you will run your tests, you will notice the tests can be viewable in the VNC viewer. 🙌🏼&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BiKuS90w--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/m37ib9b6fslp3prfti7c.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BiKuS90w--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/m37ib9b6fslp3prfti7c.gif" alt="run tests in docker"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to make a share button html | Awesome button effect CSS | Modern web Coding Tutorial</title>
      <author>Modern Web</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2021 11:33:58 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/kunaal438/how-to-make-a-share-button-html-awesome-button-effect-css-modern-web-coding-tutorial-2app</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/kunaal438/how-to-make-a-share-button-html-awesome-button-effect-css-modern-web-coding-tutorial-2app</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, I am kunaal, glad you are here. Today we will see how to make share button for your website. We'll see how can we make a share options in HTML for our website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Share Button is very useful in this days as everything is online and everybody uses social media. Share button is used to enable sharing image, audio, link or anything. We'll make share options UI only in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So without wasting more time let's start. You can see the demo of the button in the video below or you can watch video for better understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#video-tutorial"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Video Tutorial
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lSO6FvNCFLU"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lets-code-this"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Let's Code This
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to start we need 3 files HTML, CSS and JS file. Create an &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; file and paste this code.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"container"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"share-btn"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"fas fa-share-alt"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"share-options"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"title"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;share&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"social-media"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"social-media-btn"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"far fa-folder-open"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"social-media-btn"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"fab fa-whatsapp"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"social-media-btn"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"fab fa-instagram"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"social-media-btn"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"fab fa-twitter"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"social-media-btn"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"fab fa-facebook-f"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"social-media-btn"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"fab fa-linkedin-in"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"link-container"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"link"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;https://example.com/share&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"copy-btn"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;copy&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is our share button structure now let's style this. For that create a &lt;code&gt;style.css&lt;/code&gt; file. Inside that code this.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;box-sizing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;border-box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100vh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;justify-content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;align-items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#ff7d7d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.share-btn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;relative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#fff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#ff7d7d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;60px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;60px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;30px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding-top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2.5px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding-right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;3px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;cursor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;pointer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;z-index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.share-options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;absolute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;bottom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.copy-btn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;absolute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#fff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;30%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;text-transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;capitalize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;16px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.share-options.active&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.share-options.active&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.social-media&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.share-options.active&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.link-container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;opacity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;.5s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transition-delay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;.5s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are done with styles also. Now we need JS to toggle our share button's active class. Now create &lt;code&gt;app.js&lt;/code&gt; and code this.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;shareBtn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;.share-btn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;shareOptions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;.share-options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shareBtn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;shareOptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;classList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toggle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;active&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That's all We are done with our share button. Great work.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi guys, I'm proud to present you my latest project: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://fakeflixapp.vercel.app/"&gt;Fakeflix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--88jFhxs7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jwfbe1hsjja10je8g8xf.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--88jFhxs7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jwfbe1hsjja10je8g8xf.png" alt="Home"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have started this project with the purpose of learning how to structure a Web App of a mid-level complexity integrating the &lt;a href="https://redux.js.org/"&gt;Redux&lt;/a&gt; logic and experiment with things like &lt;a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk"&gt;Redux Thunk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://redux-saga.js.org/"&gt;Redux Saga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://firebase.google.com/"&gt;Firebase&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.framer.com/motion/"&gt;Framer Motion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--J9OxgtW---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r40tqi7elhxwv6kfvsgc.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--J9OxgtW---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r40tqi7elhxwv6kfvsgc.png" alt="Detail Modal"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PR37DGV1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xs82szd1hakd4xe39il1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PR37DGV1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xs82szd1hakd4xe39il1.png" alt="Search view"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a Netflix clone: I've tried to replicate the original layout as much as possible and I've also made some improvements in some sections inserting route animations and micro-interactions. I've also inserted a really close clone of Netflix's original splash animation, &lt;strong&gt;made entirely with CSS&lt;/strong&gt;, as well as the play animation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--38yvU5Gk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/phb60kqgaolz4gnvlm34.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--38yvU5Gk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/phb60kqgaolz4gnvlm34.png" alt="Sign In"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tQi2CzvN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ups6fxxcxh8or5vwjvod.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tQi2CzvN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ups6fxxcxh8or5vwjvod.png" alt="Sign Up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put a lot of effort into it and I hope that you could like it and show some love by starring the project and following me on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
🎯 About&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have started this project with the purpose of learning how to structure a Web App of a mid-level complexity integrating the Redux logic.&lt;br&gt;
I've tried to replicate the original layout as much as possible and I've also made some improvements in some sections inserting route animations and micro-interactions. I've also inserted a really close clone of Netflix's original splash animation, made entirely with CSS, as well as the play animation.&lt;br&gt;
I put a lot of effort into it and I hope that you could like it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Web App redirects you to an authentication page, in which you can choose to sign up or to sign in: you can sign in with your custom account or with your Google account. Once you are logged in and after the splash animation, you will land on…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="gh-btn-container"&gt;&lt;a class="gh-btn" href="https://github.com/Th3Wall/Fakeflix"&gt;View on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I would be glad to hear your feedbacks about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here you can find the demo link:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://fakeflixapp.vercel.app/"&gt;https://fakeflixapp.vercel.app/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next weeks I will publish more articles about this project, focusing on pieces of the code that is what we like most ;)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you are a backend engineer who wants to load data to your site using the React library, or you want to explore the use of React with Laravel. Or maybe you have other interests in using Laravel with React, either way you are at the right place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to learn how to make a POST request to a Laravel application using React and retrieve the response.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Browsing Jetpack Compose samples</title>
      <author>Anton Shilov</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2021 10:09:54 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/antonshilov/browsing-jetpack-compose-samples-32m6</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/antonshilov/browsing-jetpack-compose-samples-32m6</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#problem"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Problem
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While writing apps with Jetpack Compose you can always &lt;code&gt;Cmd+Click&lt;/code&gt; on a library function to check their sources and comments. And often you can find a link to the sample code with an example of usages for that function. Unfortunately, sample code is not published together with the Jetpack Compose library so you cannot browse them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ORbK3hs0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/a3a457slucs0wzfb1t86.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ORbK3hs0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/a3a457slucs0wzfb1t86.png" alt="Sample documentation"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#easy-solution"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Easy Solution
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All Jetpack Compose sources are open and published as a part of the AndroidX repo. We can quickly find sample code using &lt;a href="https://cs.android.com"&gt;Android Code Search&lt;/a&gt; website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hRZl6OFc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u1oia5ix1tkb3exejbam.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hRZl6OFc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u1oia5ix1tkb3exejbam.gif" alt="code-search"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy sample name from the sources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open &lt;a href="https://cs.android.com"&gt;https://cs.android.com&lt;/a&gt; in the browser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search for the sample code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#better-solution"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Better solution
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping a browser tab open and manually copying function name is quite a hassle. We can do better, we can automate it! And CodeSearch plugin can help us with that. It allows us to launch search queries right from the IDE, and we can add a custom search engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install Code Search plugin &lt;a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12578-codesearch"&gt;https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12578-codesearch&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add Android Code Search engine to plugin settings(IDE restart required).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Name:&lt;/strong&gt; Android CS&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Url:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://cs.android.com/search?q=lang:kotlin%20usage:"&gt;https://cs.android.com/search?q=lang:kotlin usage:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZwDcjZwX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vpbb90ykxzg9no061z7l.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZwDcjZwX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vpbb90ykxzg9no061z7l.png" alt="Search settings"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Select the sample name and search for it&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--z-efbhJP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nb2m44k82irrqu91na3c.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--z-efbhJP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nb2m44k82irrqu91na3c.gif" alt="Plugin usage"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Neo4j GraphQL Library</title>
      <author>Tomek Poniatowicz</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2021 09:57:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/graphqleditor/neo4j-graphql-library-3c96</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/graphqleditor/neo4j-graphql-library-3c96</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A booming market has created the demand for reducing the time to market of software products to a minimum. The current trend is pushing app development more and more towards versatility and speed to market, which has caused tools like GraphQL to gain prominence and as more and more people get into GraphQL they in turn look for tools that make it easier to use for them. If you’re thinking about working with GraphQL the first thing that comes to mind is obviously the schema and wouldn't you know it, there’s a little something that can help you working on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#graph-plus-graph"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Graph plus graph
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href="https://neo4j.com/product/graphql-library/"&gt;Neo4j&lt;/a&gt;, a graph database management system. Honestly even going by that, combining GraphQL with a graph database sounds like a no brainer but there’s a bit more to it than that. Since GraphQL treats app data as a graph, a graph backend like Neo4j fits it like a glove. Neo4j is written in Java but is very versatile and translates data from sources written in other languages into Cypher queries which makes it perfect for GraphQL and its SDL (Schema Definition Language) The connection isn't something that happened by chance as Neo4j has been involved with GraphQL for years and has supported the GRAND stack for quite a while as well. Let’s look at the key features of the database itself: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;easy to learn and versatile query language&lt;/strong&gt;: Cypher is a powerful, declarative query language inspired by SQL which uses ASCII-Art syntax to make querying graph data easy to read, learn and use for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ACID compliance&lt;/strong&gt;: atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability, basically a set of properties which make sure the data is valid despite errors, power cuts, and other problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;performance and adjustability&lt;/strong&gt;: graph databases in general provide great performance especially for more complex queries and a ton of flexibility due to the graph data model being ‘whiteboard-friendly’ and the graph query model being very intuitive and transparent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#equals-neo4j-graphql-library"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Equals Neo4j GraphQL Library
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April Neo4j released the Neo4j GraphQL Library, a tool which makes using the two even easier and more beneficial. It's designed to be a low code library aimed at fully utilising the power of connected data in API development. It basically acts as an intermediary between your GraphQL client and the Neo4j database making sure everything works smoothly between frontend and backend development. In more technical terms because GraphQL uses a schema and type safe SDL the library is written in TypeScript and takes a schema-first approach as well minimizing the amount of backend code needed. Let’s look at what it does for you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;GraphQL queries are translated into a single Cypher query, this solves the n+1 query problem and makes sure there are no unnecessary database calls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generates Cypher code from GraphQL, GraphQL CRUD API from type definitions, auto-generated resolvers, and allows custom logic with its cypher schema directive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provides strong authorization to secure your GraphQL API, nested mutations and Object-Graph-Mapper&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tJQq_kRI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uw1g54ycgw16vhblzx5f.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tJQq_kRI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uw1g54ycgw16vhblzx5f.png" alt="Neo4j GraphQL Library"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#source-neo4jcom"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Source: &lt;a href="https://neo4j.com/product/graphql-library/"&gt;neo4j.com&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#and-maybe-even-add-on-something-else"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  And maybe even add on something else
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all the library does exactly what it promises and if you’re already using GraphQL that's a good enough reason to check it out. The benefits of using Neo4j are pretty apparent in and of itself and, as mentioned before, it just fits GraphQL perfectly. You can also use it along with some of the popular frameworks like React, Vue, Angular and others to get even more out of it, but we'll take a look at that next time when we check out the GRAND stack.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>React State Management with Recoil</title>
      <author>Jakub Abramowski</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2021 09:51:43 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/sonalake/react-state-management-with-recoil-3fpk</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/sonalake/react-state-management-with-recoil-3fpk</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Deciding which state management library to use in a new &lt;a href="https://reactjs.org/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;React&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; project can be quite a challenge – there are so many options. Obviously &lt;a href="https://redux.js.org/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Redux&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is high on the list, however it requires a lot of boilerplate even in small apps that don’t require a lot of global state management. On the other hand, &lt;a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;React Context&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is very simple, but any change to the &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt; prop causes all the consumer’s children to rerender, even when only a small bit of the data is being used by them. You could use &lt;a href="https://mobx.js.org/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mobx&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but there’s a steep learning curve there, especially if you’re not quite familiar with observables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, there is nothing wrong with any of these solutions, but they all have one downside – they are ‘external’ to React. Wouldn’t it be better to have something created especially for React?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new kid on the block comes from the React team themselves – it’s called &lt;a href="https://recoiljs.org/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recoil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The library is still in the experimental phase and has not been released in a stable version, but it’s a good time to start playing around with it, since it might prove the best choice for React developers in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is Recoil and what makes it so special? I will try to explain while creating a small shop that allows users to purchase some products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the basic stuff – first we need to wrap our app (or just the part that needs access to the global state) in &lt;code&gt;RecoilRoot&lt;/code&gt; (remember to import it from &lt;em&gt;recoil&lt;/em&gt;, I won’t include all the imports here).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ReactDOM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;StrictMode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;RecoilRoot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/RecoilRoot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/React.StrictMode&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s it, we’re all set to use Recoil in our code!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The smallest unit of state in Recoil is called an atom. It is a function that requires a unique key and a default value, and returns a writable piece of state.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cartState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;atom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;cartState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To write/read from that atom, we need to use the useRecoilState hook.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useRecoilState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cartState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looks nice and simple, doesn’t it? And the best thing is, it has the exact same syntax as standard React hooks, which dramatically flattens the learning curve once you get familiar with some basic Recoil concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s stock our little shop with some products.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;products&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Toothbrush&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Smart TV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;800&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Laptop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;600&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Chocolate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Apple juice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, we’ll display them to the user so they can add them to their cart.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ShopProducts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCart&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useSetRecoilState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cartState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

 &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;addToCart&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cart&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

 &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="na"&gt;PRODUCTS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;products&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;addToCart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;       &lt;span class="p"&gt;))}&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this component we do not need access to the cart, we only require a setter function to be able to add products to it. We can use the &lt;code&gt;useSetRecoilState&lt;/code&gt; hook in the &lt;code&gt;setCart&lt;/code&gt; function to achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now all we need to do is render this component within our app.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ShopProducts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now we can see a list of products, each having a button next to it that says ‘Add to cart’. But what about the cart? We need a way of showing it’s content to the user. Let’s take care of that.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Cart&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useRecoilState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cartState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

 &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;removeFromCart&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;

 &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="na"&gt;CART&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Empty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
             &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
               &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
               &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;removeFromCart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;             &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;           &lt;span class="p"&gt;))}&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And remember to include Cart in the app.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ShopProducts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Cart&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now we are able to see the cart’s content or the string ‘Empty’ it’s empty. Of course – I know, I know – we could use some fancy icon to represent an empty cart, and we could also allow users to buy multiple products of the same type, but hey it’s just a simple app to demonstrate how easy it is to manage the state with Recoil, so bear with me please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next thing we need is to display the total price. We can do that using a selector.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cartDetailsState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="na"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;cartDetailsState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="na"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cart&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cartState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

   &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;total&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;prev&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cur&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;prev&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cur&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

   &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nx"&gt;total&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Simple as that! Selectors let you create derived state from atoms, but you can also pass props to them, or even access setter functions, but we’ll get there later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is to add a component that will read the cart details state.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;CartDetails&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;total&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useRecoilValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cartDetailsState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

 &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;TOTAL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;total&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ShopProducts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Cart&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;CartDetails&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#item-discounts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Item Discounts
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say we want to allow the shop manager to set discounts for all the products. We can create a simple select with a few options, prepare an atom for holding the shop’s configuration, which will include the discount, and then expand the &lt;code&gt;CartDetails&lt;/code&gt; selector logic to include the new state:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;shopConfigState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;atom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="na"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;shopState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="na"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="na"&gt;discount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cartDetailsState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="na"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;cartDetailsState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="na"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;discount&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shopConfigState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cart&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cartState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

   &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;total&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;prev&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cur&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;prev&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cur&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;discountAmount&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;total&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;discount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

   &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nx"&gt;total&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nx"&gt;discountAmount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;CartDetails&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;total&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;discount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;discountAmount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCart&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nx"&gt;DISCOUNT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;discount&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;discountAmount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;TOTAL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;total&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;TOTAL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AFTER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;DISCOUNT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;total&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;discountAmount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([])}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Clear&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ShopConfig&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shopState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setShopState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useRecoilState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shopConfigState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

 &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;updateDiscount&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setShopState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shopState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;discount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

 &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="na"&gt;Discount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shopState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;discount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;updateDiscount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;option&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/option&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;       &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;option&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.05&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/option&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;       &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;option&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/option&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;       &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;option&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/option&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ShopConfig&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ShopProducts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Cart&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;CartDetails&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now our little shopping app is complete! The code looks very simple compared to Redux, but it has even more out-of-the-box features which make it a great competitor for all the other state management tools, and the coolest one is that it supports asynchronicity! Just like that, no additional libraries are needed, no extra code needs to be added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#asynchronous"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Asynchronous&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s change the way we provide the product list to the shop.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getProductsFromDB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;products&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;productsQuery&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="na"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Products&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="na"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getProductsFromDB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;getProductsFromDB&lt;/code&gt; is a function that waits 2.5 second (to simulate a network latency, or database response time) to simply resolve a promise with the product list that we’ve created at the beginning. The important part here is the selector with an async getter function – it simply calls the aforementioned function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recoil is built to work with &lt;a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactsuspense"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;React Suspense&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and this is how they can be connected.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ShopProducts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;shopProducts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useRecoilValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;productsQuery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCart&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useSetRecoilState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cartState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

 &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;addToCart&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cart&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

 &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="na"&gt;PRODUCTS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shopProducts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;addToCart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;       &lt;span class="p"&gt;))}&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ShopConfig&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Suspense&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fallback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Loading&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;products&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&amp;gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;       &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ShopProducts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/React.Suspense&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Cart&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;CartDetails&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From now on, before the product list gets displayed on the screen, the user will see a nice fallback loader component for 2.5 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about handling errors? Simply wrap the component in an &lt;a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;error boundary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if I don’t really want to use React Suspense? It’s still experimental and using it in production is still discouraged (well, so is Recoil).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a way of using async Recoil without Suspense.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ShopProducts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCart&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useSetRecoilState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cartState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;shopProducts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useRecoilValueLoadable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;productsQuery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

 &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;addToCart&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cart&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

 &lt;span class="k"&gt;switch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shopProducts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;loading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Loading&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;products&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;
&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;hasError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="k"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;shopProducts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;contents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;hasValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="na"&gt;PRODUCTS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shopProducts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;contents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
             &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
               &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
               &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;addToCart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;             &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;           &lt;span class="p"&gt;))}&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;       &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When using &lt;code&gt;useRecoilValueLoadable&lt;/code&gt;, we get access to an object containing the current state of an async selector’s promise and, when it’s resolved, either to contents or error. This works exactly the same as in case of using Suspense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#summary"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum up, there are numerous ways of dealing with global state in React apps. Some have a steep learning curve, others are inefficient and in most cases and dedicated to just some pieces of state that don’t change very often. Now that we have Recoil within our reach, we can write state logic in a very similar way to how we write UI logic. The result is that creating React apps is even simpler and even more fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to experiment, the &lt;a href="https://github.com/jakub-abramowski-sonalake/recoil-demo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;recoil-demo source is available on Github&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy coding!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hetchr Beta : a developer's homepage</title>
      <author>Hetchr.</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2021 09:37:37 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/hetc_hr/hetchr-beta-a-developer-s-homepage-31fh</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/hetc_hr/hetchr-beta-a-developer-s-homepage-31fh</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi folks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We centralize the main features of your everyday tools (PRs, CI, Kanban tasks) and build a live feed of everything happening within your development teams. Essentially, we aggregate a "quick view" of your team's development status and give you a way to manage tasks directly from our platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We just opened up beta testing and anyone can create an account here: &lt;a href="https://preview.hetchr.com/signup"&gt;https://preview.hetchr.com/signup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, we have integrated Github Issues, Github Pull Requests, Jira, and two native Hetchr ATOMs.  Next on the list are CircleCI / Github Actions / Jenkins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some additional notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only data we permanently store is your name, email, and authentication credential.  While using Hetchr, we only collect and store locally the data necessary to display your workspace.  For Jira, we access/store your project's configurations and the issues.  For Github, we access/store your Issues and Pull Requests' comments (not the code).  You can delete your account and any associated data in the setting section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to install our Jira ATOM, you must be the Jira administrator and in order to install our Github ATOMs, you must be the repo owner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for taking a look!  I’d love to hear your thoughts and happy to answer questions 🙂 &lt;/p&gt;

About 3 years ago I started as a Quality Assurance Engineer at SinnerSchrader and just recently, I switched my position to Scrum Master/ Agile Coach. Besides that, I'm the lead of our Diversity Skill Group and part of several cool change &amp;amp; social initiatives at SinnerSchrader. What sparks my joy is video games, music, french fries and intersectional feminism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#thats-a-great-variety-of-interests-what-made-you-want-to-switch-from-being-a-quality-assurance-engineer-to-doing-something-else"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  That's a great variety of interests!🍟 What made you want to switch from being a Quality Assurance Engineer to doing something else?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved being a tester and I still do have feelings for it. I mean I really like the aspect of analyzing the shit out of things, thinking outside of the box to catch all cases, trying out things that weren’t expected, bothering developers… but over time I simply realized that I hit the ceiling of possibilities when it came to developing and using my soft skills in the QA. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-come-you-decided-that-being-a-scrum-master-agile-coach-would-be-the-right-fit"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How come you decided that being a Scrum Master/ Agile Coach would be the right fit?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I’ve been a QA tester in a cross-functional and agile team, and watching my Scrum Masters doing their job, I eventually found many of the traits I craved in them and their daily work. I like the idea of servant leadership, empowering others to become an autonomous collective and fostering their professional relationships. And I’m really happy that SinnerSchrader gave me the opportunity to do this switch (unpaid ad...🥺).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-did-you-realize-that-you-needed-a-job-that-would-fulfill-you-in-a-different-way-as-well"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How did you realize that you needed a job that would fulfill you in a different way as well?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, all the social initiatives I did in parallel to my daily QA job started to spark more joy than working as a tester. Engaging for people &amp;amp; equal opportunities, driving change, motivating others to join in, questioning status quos, creating processes and being there for my peers and my team made me grow way more than I expected, so that slowly but surely, it shifted what I thought were my ideal job requirements. Somehow it was a logical consequence for me to dig into the idea of becoming some kind of coach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#can-you-share-some-details-about-the-initiatives-youre-working-on-next-to-your-daily-job"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Can you share some details about the initiatives you’re working on next to your daily job?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give a little context, the SinnerSchrader Skill Groups are usually a mix between a topic-related study group and a task force, which can be joined by people of all disciplines, levels and studios. They are an independent, non-hierarchical place where people can share knowledge, learnings, groom their soft- and hard skills and drive internal projects next to their normal jobs. We have several of them and when I found that &lt;a href="https://dev.to/kotzendekrabbe"&gt;Feli Kugland&lt;/a&gt; initiated a Skill Group that focussed on pushing diversity topics in our work environment, I joined and never left, knowing that there’s still a ton of work to do when it comes to diversity in our society. Since then, the skill group organized talks, workshops, discussion rounds and much more, all under the umbrella of creating a safe and welcoming environment for the people of SinnerSchrader. &lt;br&gt;
Considering that the Skill Group handles topics in an overarching and SinnerSchrader-wide manner and therefore decision paths are naturally longer, I’m also part of a studio based Change Team which is tackling similar topics, but in a more decentralized way, focussing on our studio in Hamburg and driving innovation from within. This team is responsible for analyzing pain points within the studio, forming initiatives and promoting change for the overall wellbeing of the people working in our studio in Hamburg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#can-you-name-some-topics-the-skill-group-and-the-change-team-are-working-on"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Can you name some topics the Skill Group and the Change Team are working on?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among other tasks, we’re currently working on concepts for trainings addressing anti-racism &amp;amp; allyship, we’re deriving next steps for gender pay gap prevention and educating on unconscious bias. We also implemented regular employee happiness surveys, guidelines for inclusive language &amp;amp; meeting culture, celebrated the International Women’s Day and formed alliances with several departments in the company to gather the necessary tools and support, so that we’re able to tackle all these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-it-that-drives-your-engagement"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is it that drives your engagement?🚀
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anger and impulsiveness, I guess...😄&lt;br&gt;
I know this sounds hackneyed now, but what I’ve learned about anger is that this emotion has such a negative connotation although anger ≠ aggression. We tend to equate anger with destruction, violence and even becoming blind from anger when in fact, it’s a powerful vehicle for being consequent and passionate about something that bothers us. It’s all just depending on the driver of this vehicle, and how they’re capable of expressing their anger in a healthy way. There’s so much more to anger than blind rage. Angriness is transformative and potent; the response to it isn’t necessarily fear or dismissal. Once you’re on the anger train, you can be super determined, fast and brave. And since anger is a particularly honest emotion, it holds the power of motivating others to jump onto it, uplifting awareness for things that matter to you, empowering solidarity and creating a stir that simply can’t be unseen. &lt;br&gt;
Well, and same goes for impulsivity. At first glance, reacting on impulses might appear unreflected or hasty when in fact, impulsivity is an intuitive response that comes along with a shitload of bravery. It took me some time to learn not to feel bad for being impulsive and reflect the source of my reactions, so as a result, I could start trusting my intuition instead of suppressing it. As long as we’re being respectful and minding basic human decency, impulsivity and impromptu actions have a high potential of serving a good purpose. If something doesn’t seem quite right or feels unfair, we should normalize releasing our concerns and immediately address them where they belong. Even if it sometimes seems like you’re creating a fuss, trust your gut feeling and learn in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#so-is-this-something-that-youd-like-to-share-with-everyone"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  So is this something that you’d like to share with everyone?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, just own it and grow. Be progressive. &lt;br&gt;
Dare to&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;rant&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’m well aware that this is easier said than done. Sadly, both anger and impulsiveness are united by one aspect which makes it difficult for some people to harness from them; it’s the fact that as women and girls in a patriarchal society, we are still constantly told that anger isn’t suitable for us and impulsiveness is not a “feminine” trait. That we should prevent at all costs to make others feel uncomfortable. That we have to hold back ourselves in order for others to come forward and that this is the definition of kindness. That women and girls have to be nothing else but modest, gentle and nurturing. &lt;br&gt;
Throughout history, our assertive traits are belittled by sentences like “You’re cute when you’re angry”. Being loud and determined about something that bothers us evokes subliminal oppression like tone policing or gaslighting, for instance by calling us crazy, falsely accusing us of being hysterical/ overreacting/ being on our period or a high maintenance Medusa (as if that was something bad!), so that eventually we turn our anger inwards or towards ourselves. It’s striking how deeply all this is interwoven with our identity. And how much we submit to it, without ever calling it into question. Systematically reproduced, we’ve internalized all of it as it was a natural condition. &lt;br&gt;
Nah. I don’t want me, my peers and the future generation to approve of those limitations any longer. I know I’m capable of being headstrong and kind at the same time! Let’s start fighting for each other and allow us to be gentle to ourselves, too. I want us to naturally trust our intuitions, express our emotions and learn from our own mistakes. Let’s normalize failure and stop striving for perfection. And lastly, let’s realize that sometimes, a woman’s anger is a reflection of a collective yearning to break with normative bonds of social control. Let’s start owning and reclaiming our emotions and reactions the way we want, the way we need to. So that we can become our authentic selves again.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;/rant&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’m looking forward to meeting these selves.❤️&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#well-that-got-deep-fast"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Well, that got deep fast!🤯
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, let me know if you need a party crasher!🤡&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to See Which Branch Your Teammates are on in VS Code</title>
      <author>SuDa2103</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2021 09:20:33 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/gitlive/how-to-see-which-branch-your-teammates-are-on-in-vs-code-cb1</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/gitlive/how-to-see-which-branch-your-teammates-are-on-in-vs-code-cb1</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"What branch are you on?"&lt;/em&gt; is often the first question you ask when a teammate says &lt;em&gt;"The tests aren't passing"&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;"The build failed"&lt;/em&gt;. Here's how you can get an answer to that question without even needing to ask.&lt;br&gt;
In VS Code, open up the team tab by clicking on the GitLive icon on the activity bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UM7feG5I--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6033cf9dce54c65d97d57571/60dc2f057742ba751f4b670d_P4%25258lkvvRciwZO%252BKdU4Vkg_thumb_337.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UM7feG5I--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6033cf9dce54c65d97d57571/60dc2f057742ba751f4b670d_P4%25258lkvvRciwZO%252BKdU4Vkg_thumb_337.jpg" alt="vs code view"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will show a list of your teammates, if they are online (or away) and the issue they are currently working on. Locate the teammate you are interested in and click the arrow on the left-hand side of their avatar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Y2Kg2VaM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6033cf9dce54c65d97d57571/60dc2ef91526165c62dc08a1_img%25202.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Y2Kg2VaM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6033cf9dce54c65d97d57571/60dc2ef91526165c62dc08a1_img%25202.png" alt="vs code view"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you will see all the repositories they have cloned including the name of their current branch!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wLyB4Xgq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6033cf9dce54c65d97d57571/60dc2ef4934bbc85921ee87f_image.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wLyB4Xgq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6033cf9dce54c65d97d57571/60dc2ef4934bbc85921ee87f_image.png" alt="vs code view"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: If an issue has been connected to the branch you'll see the issue name instead, if that's the case just hover your cursor over the issue name and a tooltip will appear showing you the branch name (and even the commit hash).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nU5tTMZ3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6033cf9dce54c65d97d57571/60dc2eff1f3a80255c49f6e6_img%25204.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nU5tTMZ3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6033cf9dce54c65d97d57571/60dc2eff1f3a80255c49f6e6_img%25204.png" alt="vs code view"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't have the GitLive extension installed yet? You can find it &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamHub.teamhub"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and, if you need help setting it up, follow the instructions &lt;a href="https://docs.git.live/docs/installation/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
