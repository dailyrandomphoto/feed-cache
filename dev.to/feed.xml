      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I built a SaaS in 30 days... and it was way more complicated that I originally thought, but check out how I did it, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Picking a topic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning AI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Registering a domain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a logo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Designing a landing page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coding the website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frontend and Backend design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking Payment with Stripe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VPS setup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launching it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent seven days building my own SAS, it's gonna help developers win at life by using AI. And in this video, I'm going to show you how I did it all the fun and all the pain and an actual product. At the end, they say developers can build anything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I'm a developer, and I want to build just something, I want to build a SAS. And I'm not really sassy, per se. But a SAS is just a software as a service. And it seems easy enough to build, you just need some front end, maybe some back end. And maybe you need it to work without bugs we'll see along the way. But I want to build something really cool. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XqbSIA9U--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3t7uwl8ji8t72t7q3b2a.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XqbSIA9U--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3t7uwl8ji8t72t7q3b2a.gif" alt="Enhance AI"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I checked out GitHub co pilot, and it uses AI tech, it's really cool AI attack that autocompletes what you're writing, and I wanted to use some of their tech to build a SAS a number of tools, maybe for developers or something like that, because I'm a little bit of a tool myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And whenever I jump into a problem, I always have to Google it, if there was an easier way for me not to have to Google the same things over and over, like how to perform a git merge or for example, how to, you know, just do basic commands, or even regex regex just blows my mind with some of the syntax. So I'm going to try and build a tool around that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the way I'm going to do it is I'm going to show you, I'm going to take you on this journey where I'm trying to solve this problems of building a SAS, this will be everything like trying to build the front end and the back end trying to design it and everything in between. So let's jump into my very first day of trying to do this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cMlmpe7c--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3d333tfm8v4r2ybfmt7b.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cMlmpe7c--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3d333tfm8v4r2ybfmt7b.gif" alt="EnhanceAI"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#learning-ai"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Learning AI
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the first thing I need to do is get access to some AI tools. There are lots out there, Google has their own machine learning suite, so does Amazon and even Microsoft themselves. But this isn't what got me excited in the first place. What really I enjoyed was GitHub co pilot. And that was made by a company called Open AI. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they created their own AI tech called GPT. Two and now also GPT three, which created the model that they're using, which is I think called codecs that they have for developers using VS code. That's what I wanted to use to create some of these tools. So I tried to jump onto their website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And unfortunately, even though there are companies called Open AI, you can't just jump in there and get access and sign up, you actually have to go through a waitlist and a process. So I did just that. And I waited, and waited. And eventually I did get in. So now here I am inside of their playground. And I'm going to try and see if some of these ideas that I have around building tools with AI actually even work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let's try them out. I jumped on the open AI website to try and figure out how it all works. I was a little scared at first because sometimes documentation can be terrible and some developer websites. But honestly, the open API documentation is some of the best I've seen so far. I'd actually even reminds me of stripe documentation, which is world class. But this does not mean I know what I'm doing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I jumped into their playground system. And I was overwhelmed with all these different things like models response temperature, Toppy frequency presidency, I was just at a loss. So I jumped into their examples here, it shows off some of the things you can build with open AI. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for me, I wanted to kick things off with a regex completer. I played around with a lot of different settings and prompts until I got a number of things working like a JavaScript chatbot and even the regex. So it means that it is possible seems like there is some cool merit to this idea around creating natural language to solve programming problems that we all have. But let's have a look at the next most important step in building their SAS. And that is to register the domain name. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to do that I need a business name. And that is one of the hardest things to do. I thought about all different types of options. And I came up with a name called sub writer, or was it sub editor? I can't remember but I immediately went to register, there is new domain names out there. called.ai. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WnpfPrlb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/06wp4lpsb30t9x3npyq7.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WnpfPrlb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/06wp4lpsb30t9x3npyq7.gif" alt="Enhance AI.ai"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#registering-a-domain"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Registering a Domain
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I jumped on and registered subeditor.ai domain. And actually then after spending, I think two $300 I decided no, no, I don't like this domain name, I need to register another domain name. One of the things that I've been doing recently is building enhance UI, which is a book for developers to learn design. So I thought I might as well keep up the trend and create enhance AI, which can be a bunch of tools for developers to use AI to improve their daily jobs, write blogs and stuff like that. So let's register that domain name as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Wiw_4p3C--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1ohkq21562e6tru58h7q.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Wiw_4p3C--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1ohkq21562e6tru58h7q.gif" alt="EnhanceAI.ai"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-a-logo"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating a Logo
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we've got this done, we can look at the hardest part of creating any sass product as a developer, and that is to create the logo. Now for a logo, it's going to have to be something amazing when people look at this logo, it has to have the representation of developers and tools and open AI and all of that. So what I did was put some circles and squares together and here's the logo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--el-I_dTQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/365zs5iap6tdfv1o6z9r.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--el-I_dTQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/365zs5iap6tdfv1o6z9r.gif" alt="Adrian Twarog"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#designing-a-landing-page"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Designing a Landing Page
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up, we need to create a landing page so that when people have a look at this product, they're more inclined to try out and even purchase it. To do this, I'm going to jump on to figma. And we're going to create a design based off the logo, what I want to do is pull in some of those colours from the logo, some of those shapes like the squares and the circles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I want to create a design that sort of gives people an idea of how the tool works. So I might send her it with a nice box and give them an example of how maybe he can explain code and what it's doing, as well as have lots of call to actions for people to sign up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a designer sort of came up with, it's nothing too fancy. And I probably continued to play around with it. But at least it's up and running. So the next thing we have to do is actually code it. So I'm going to code it in just some basic HTML and CSS. So let's try and do that right now. So I opened up VS code installed, tailwind CSS, and started coding it all from my figma design. And in no time I was done, I don't often have nightmares. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But last night, I had a nightmare that I'm gonna have to write out every single individual line of code for this SAS. Now, that's sometimes an interesting take as a developer because you enjoy coding, but sometimes it's just too much. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I'm going to try and use a page builder. And please don't judge me when I say this, I'm going to use web flow, I'm going to see if you can redesign some of these tailwind designs inside there. And if it takes me as long or quicker, just as a test. And if in this case, it's easier, I might just swap the whole landing page to webflow. And then when we actually build the app, I'll then definitely build that on react. But for the landing page, it's going to be changed all the time. And I just think that react might be overkill to build this thing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Vpi_2nyK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/345adbt0m3zhpn7wmcpc.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Vpi_2nyK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/345adbt0m3zhpn7wmcpc.gif" alt="Enhance AI"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#front-end-and-back-end"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Front end and back end
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it's time to build the front end and the back end, the best parts, let's work with the front end to start off with, let's use create react app for that. And I'll just start building that. And at the same time, I also need a backend to do even basic stuff, like logins. So let's use our favourite node Express and Mongo, I might use the cloud version of Mongo, just because later, I want to make sure that it persists if I'm going to scale it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--solQ3HFj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jmx4u757gd2cr528cc0v.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--solQ3HFj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jmx4u757gd2cr528cc0v.gif" alt="EAI"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it's a traditional route for building an a SAS. So let's just get started with that. Next, we'll need a payment processor, like for example, II way or PayPal or even stripe because you do not want to store credit card information yourself. So I decided to go with stripe because they're a popular one. And I do want to do subscriptions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that should be easy to set up. It wasn't easy to set up. But now that it's done, then it's all working. And every time someone jumps in, they can do a free trial to test out the product before they fully sign up and commit, which is something you want to do. Because no one wants to purchase something immediately without actually trying it out these days. Next, we need a place to host this entire system, both the front end and the back end, because it's not going to host itself, which was Linode&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5qMWEubL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dczdh8q1h4mvkpwqby40.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5qMWEubL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dczdh8q1h4mvkpwqby40.gif" alt="Enhance AI Adrian Twarog"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#launching"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Launching
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally it's done! I create a post on Twitter, and Article on Hashnode, and a video on youtube. You can find them below.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Analytics Box - A simple privacy focused analytics in GO. </title>
      <author>KetanIP</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/ketanip/analytics-box-a-simple-privacy-focused-analytics-in-go-hmm</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Repo: &lt;a href="https://github.com/KetanIP/analytics"&gt;https://github.com/KetanIP/analytics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello guys, today I am here to share with you a project that I've made recently, it is Analytics Box - A simple privacy focused analytics in Golang. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-analytics-box-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Analytics Box ?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analytics box is analytics tool like google analytics but instead of ripping user's privacy off them like google it respects their privacy and doesn't collect any unnecessary information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#features"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Features
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No Cookies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forgets user in 24 hours so even if wish to know user's private info you can't.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can track unique page views effectively without hurting user's privacy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom events available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Super simple to setup. ( 1 go binary + 1 super small script on frontend ).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Super low resource consumption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dashboard is decoupled from the tool so you can use any tool ( like Metabase for visualization of data ).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports multiple SQL database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#you-may-wish-to-ask-some-question-here-are-some-faq"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  You may wish to ask some question here are some FAQ.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-do-we-uniquely-identify-users"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How do we uniquely identify users?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We identify users uniquely by creating a hash and storing it in a Redis database along with a UUID which automatically deletes itself in 24 hours.&lt;br&gt;
hash = md5( raw_public_ip + browser_name + operating_system + date + secret)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It generates a 32 character long string with is stored in database along with a UUID and it is only valid for a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parameters used in hash have the following reasons,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;IP&lt;/strong&gt; - to identify user ( It may be a public IP like café or a user's own IP )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Browser&lt;/strong&gt; - So if user changes his/her browser we forget it.
&lt;strong&gt;Operating System&lt;/strong&gt; - So if user changes its device we forget him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Date&lt;/strong&gt; - So we forget user daily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Secret&lt;/strong&gt; - Here comes the most important part we while production recommend to use a UUID that isn't logged anywhere so even if want to view user's private info you can't, but while development use a hardcoded string as you restart server many times and it will generate false unique visitors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-makes-it-different-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What makes it different ?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many privacy friendly analytics tool but here are some points that makes it special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is written in go so you can but it on the same server as your app as it uses nearly to negligible amount of resource ( in large schema of things ).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is written in go fiber which can handle a by lot I mean around 35,000 requests per second ( as per their website).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It currently supports PostgreSQL and in future I plan to add support for Clickhouse because of its amazing performance, and I will continue to keep postgres supported for as long as possible because of its low resource consumption it would be a great tool for small websites like blogs, like one that, I have though it hasn't been updated for a while now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don't plan to convert it into a SaaS application ( at least in near future ) as I don't want to make another SaaS privacy focused analytics app as there are already many good in market. I'm making this in a way that you can get most insights from your data so it doesn't have a dashboard ( use something like Metabase for it here are some screenshots of dashboard that I build within 3-4 minutes while writing this readme and I'm no profession and it on par with what SaaS provides apps provides to you) with complete control over your data and it can run on simple commodity hardware for a long period of time without any manual Interventions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0OOi8nqv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/vVNg7PM.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0OOi8nqv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/vVNg7PM.jpg" alt="1st image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xTJtsEmT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/onLrNsl.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xTJtsEmT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/onLrNsl.jpg" alt="2nd image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--56S0eIfk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/G44UP29.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--56S0eIfk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/G44UP29.jpg" alt="3rd image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-dont-it-has-a-dashboard-build-in-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why don't it has a dashboard build in ?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many privacy friendly analytics tools and they have a dashboard built in as most of them are SaaS application but this isn't gonna be a SaaS app so in order to make most sense out of the data we recommend users to use something like Metabase as even a non-techie can make custom charts and if you are a techie then you can make even more sense of data by writing custom SQL Queries to obtain and visualize data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Images you saw above were made within 3-4 minutes while I was writing README for GitHub repo, and it was auto generated I just changed its sizes and names that's it. So we have made a conscious decision to decouple analytics tool and dashboard for it. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Storage Options in GCP </title>
      <author>Salah Elhossiny</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 05:20:30 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/salah856/storage-options-in-gcp-25h8</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/salah856/storage-options-in-gcp-25h8</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;GCP provides various storage options to store your application data. Different applications have different storage needs, and depending on the application, performance improves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the GCP storage options, it is very clear that it can support various storage needs like NoSQL, Document DB, Object Storage, Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), and so on. You can use Google's managed services for your storage needs, or you can use the Google infrastructure and install services that you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choosing the right storage option for your application is important. Based on the available storage options in Google, the following chart will help you to identify the right storage option:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4Q0rFklF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23625821/122635361-bbb09e80-d0e3-11eb-9570-5d05cda51873.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4Q0rFklF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23625821/122635361-bbb09e80-d0e3-11eb-9570-5d05cda51873.png" alt="1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we will discuss the following storage options in detail:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud Bigtable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud Datastore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud Firestore&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud SQL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud Spanner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud Memorystore&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cloud-bigtable-and-ai-applications"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cloud Bigtable and AI applications
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud Bigtable can act as storage in various AI and ML use cases. Most of the big data migration or modern data platforms use cloud Bigtable to build their NoSQL Database. For example, a streaming ML application can use Bigtable very well as a backend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cloud-datastore-and-ai-applications"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cloud Datastore and AI applications
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud Datastore can act as storage in AI and ML use cases for large web applications. Any e-commerce website hosted on GCP can use Datastore to save data, and using this data, ML models can be trained and can provide required recommendations to the user and in turn can increase customer satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cloud-firestore-and-ai-applications"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cloud Firestore and AI applications
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud Firestore can act as storage in AI and ML use cases for applications that are hosted on mobile and web devices. Any application hosted on GCP with both website and mobile applications can save the data in Firestore, and using this data, ML models can be trained and can provide required recommendations to users on both their mobile devices and website applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cloud-sql-and-ai-applications"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cloud SQL and AI applications
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud SQL can serve all the AI and ML use cases for large and complex structured data. Another service named Cloud Spanner can serve similar use cases, which can be served by Cloud SQL, but on a very large scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cloud-spanner-and-ai-applications"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cloud Spanner and AI applications
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud Spanner can serve all the AI and ML use cases which are suitable for MySQL and PostgreSQL. Cloud SQL is right for serving AI and ML use cases that require up to 10 TB of structured data; for example, a machine learning use case requires data preparation, which involves complex SQL joins and can increase the efficiency of the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cloud-memorystore-and-ai-applications"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cloud Memorystore and AI applications
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud Memorystore can serve various AL and ML use cases using Redis ML modules. Redis ML has various ML modules as built-in data types. Cloud Memorystore can serve machine learning modules for linear and logistic regression, decision tree matrix calculations, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-gatsby"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Gatsby?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GatsbyJS is a React-based, GraphQL powered static site generator. Gatsby is an open-source framework that combines functionality from React, GraphQL, and Webpack into a single tool for building static websites and apps. Although the term "static site generator" has been around for a while, Gatsby is more akin to a modern front-end framework than a traditional static site generator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-are-static-sites"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What are Static Sites?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Static websites have existed for a long time. They're most likely the initial website, with only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They aren't rendered in real-time because there isn't any server-side programming, no database, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A static site generator is a tool that creates static web pages. JS frameworks and libraries, on the other hand, typically produce HTML content on the client-side during runtime. This material is generated by static site generators while the site is being built. Then, after it's loaded, React takes over, and you've got yourself a single-page app!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-you-should-consider-using-gatsby"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why you should consider using Gatsby?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#seo"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  SEO
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of GatsbyJs allows your websites to make use of several of the internal code's optimization strategies. As a result, search engines will rank your website higher. There are a number of plugins that can assist you with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#plugins"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Plugins
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gatsby has some amazing plugins which can help your website in different aspects. You can install these plugins using NPM or Yarn. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the popular plugins are Source File-System, Contentful, Plugin Sharp and etc. You can find all plugins on their official website &lt;a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#speed"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Speed
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gatsby sites are much faster than many of the alternatives, even compared to cached sites using WordPress and things like that because that static site is really hard to beat in terms of its speed and performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#templates"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Templates
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are enough GatsbyJs Starter repositories and templates available that cloning and altering the content is straightforward. This allows you to quickly and efficiently construct websites such as your blog or your portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-should-you-avoid-gatsby"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why should you avoid Gatsby?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#build-time"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Build Time
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the amount of content on your website grows, so does the time it takes to produce it. This is not only inconvenient during development, but it also wastes time when it comes to deployment. Gatsby is not advised if you want to create a site that changes frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dynamic-websites"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Dynamic Websites
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sites with a lot of dynamically produced routes, because you won't be able to reap the benefits of statically generated pages if you don't know what they are at the time of construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#complex-sites"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Complex sites
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because complex sites expand quickly and take a long time to build, they are continuously adding new pages and material. Although many e-commerce companies can and do employ statically created sites, if build time becomes an issue, it is most likely time to abandon them in favor of dynamically generated sites like Gatsby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#set-up-your-first-gatsby-website"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Set Up Your First Gatsby Website
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installing-gatsby-cli"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installing Gatsby CLI
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step is to install Gatsby CLI, You can create and modify a new site using the Gatsby command-line interface. To install Gatsby CLI, simply run :&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-g&lt;/span&gt; gatsby-cli
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;-g&lt;/code&gt; argument indicates that the Gatsby command-line interface is being installed globally rather than locally. As a result, you'll be able to utilize the tool in any directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#starter-templates"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Starter Templates
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned previously that you don't need to create a website from scratch, instead we can use some starter templates which can be found on Gatsby's official website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this tutorial, we will use &lt;code&gt;gatsby-starter-default&lt;/code&gt; to do that, run the below command on your terminal.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;gatsby new gatsby-starter-default https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;gatsby new&lt;/code&gt; creates a new website. You'll get a barebones site if you utilize gatsby new on its own. Combining gatsby new with a starter template is the most typical approach to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#run-your-app-locally"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Run your app locally
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once it is done, you should see a message that Gatsby site has been successfully bootstrapped. Now run&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;gatsby-starter-default &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; gatsby develop
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This command with navigate to our new gatsby folder and initialize files, so that we can view it locally. Open your browser and navigate to &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:8000/&lt;/code&gt;, You should see a default stater page, just like image below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HMgZ3TOP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630556437929/UvPkbP0MT.png%3Fauto%3Dcompress" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HMgZ3TOP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630556437929/UvPkbP0MT.png%3Fauto%3Dcompress" alt="Gatsby Default Template"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's critical to arrange your website's metadata correctly if you want a search engine to find your website. The gatsby-config.js file allows you to customize your website's data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to make your website accessible for everybody around the globe, you need to deploy your website in a hosting service. You can deploy a Gatsby website to Netfliy, Vercel, Azure, Gatsby Cloud, Heroku, AWS, IIS, Firebase and etc. But for this example, we will use Netlify&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#deploying-website-to-netlify"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Deploying Website To Netlify
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before deploying our website, first, we need to generate a build folder that contains static files. To do that run&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;gatsby build
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once it is completed, You should see a folder named &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt;. That is it, We need only that folder to deploy in Netlify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href="https://www.netlify.com/"&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt; website and if you don't have an account, click on the signup button and create an account. Don't worry, Netfliy is free hosting and it won't charge you anything. Once you registered, you should be redirected to Netfliy dashboard, which will look like this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--s0Gx5bnh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630557032763/BJR3s93Hq.png%3Fauto%3Dcompress" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--s0Gx5bnh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630557032763/BJR3s93Hq.png%3Fauto%3Dcompress" alt="Netlify Dashboard"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now click on sites on the Netlify menu, and you should see a page with a text "Want to deploy a new site without connecting to Git? Drag and drop your site output folder here" . Drag and drop your public folder on that placeholder, Wait for a while and then your website will be deployed on Netfliy.  If it is deployed successfully you should see something similar to the below image. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8gGGfPO3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630557480458/c6_KmJUyK.png%3Fauto%3Dcompress" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8gGGfPO3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630557480458/c6_KmJUyK.png%3Fauto%3Dcompress" alt="Netlify Dashboard"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Get user input value from input box in visual studio code</title>
      <author>Adrian Matei </author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 04:54:16 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/codever/get-user-input-value-from-input-box-in-visual-studio-code-1b8e</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/codever/get-user-input-value-from-input-box-in-visual-studio-code-1b8e</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;vscode.window.showInputBox&lt;/code&gt; - the returned value will be &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; if the input box was canceled (e.g. pressing &lt;strong&gt;ESC&lt;/strong&gt;). Otherwise the returned value will be the string typed by the user or an empty string if the user did not type anything but dismissed the input box with OK.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;searchQuery&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;vscode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;showInputBox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;placeHolder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Search query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;prompt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Search my snippets on Codever&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;selectedText&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;searchQuery&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;searchQuery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;vscode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;showErrorMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;A search query is mandatory to execute this action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;searchQuery&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;searchUrl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`https://www.codever.land/search?q=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;searchQuery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;amp;sd=my-snippets`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;vscode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;openExternal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Uri&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;searchUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Prisma Data Platform - Prisma ORM on Cloud</title>
      <author>Somsubhra Das</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 04:50:19 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/somsubhra1/prisma-data-platform-prisma-orm-on-cloud-2854</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/somsubhra1/prisma-data-platform-prisma-orm-on-cloud-2854</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.prisma.io/?utm_source=Prisma%20Ambassador&amp;amp;utm_medium=Blog%20post&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Prisma%20AP%20Somsubhra%20Dass"&gt;Prisma&lt;/a&gt; Data Platform is a cloud based service which allows developers to try the Prisma ORM, run queries on cloud environment without the need to install Prisma Client locally on the developers' computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#features-of-prisma-data-platform"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Features of Prisma Data Platform
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free database provisioning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pre defined model schema templates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run and test Prisma Queries on the data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaboration between team members&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data browsing capabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#getting-started"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Getting Started
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get started, visit &lt;a href="https://cloud.prisma.io/"&gt;Prisma Data Platform&lt;/a&gt;, sign in with your GitHub Account and click on &lt;strong&gt;New Project&lt;/strong&gt;. From here, we may choose to go in two different ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create new project from scratch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Import existing project from GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-project"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating Project
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a project is simple on Prisma Data Platform. Once you create the project on Prisma Data Platform it will simultaneously create a GitHub Project for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--thZAEMca--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nz9g9w8jc388fbmn3sj0.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--thZAEMca--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nz9g9w8jc388fbmn3sj0.png" alt="Project create"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DeM3TXS2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vircta7a7x1j9wmwtqft.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DeM3TXS2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vircta7a7x1j9wmwtqft.png" alt="GitHub Project"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-database"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating Database
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prisma Data Platform can automatically spin an app instance on heroku and create a PostgreSQL database instance as well. You may connect to an existing database as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BOnWgNHm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/p1qts21h2hs80re9k1c4.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BOnWgNHm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/p1qts21h2hs80re9k1c4.png" alt="Database Creation"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Zb7LhfIJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yrmetfkl8l1x2h82euse.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Zb7LhfIJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yrmetfkl8l1x2h82euse.png" alt="PostgreSQL Heroku Add-on"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-schema"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating Schema
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the great features of Prisma Data Platform is that it provides  pre written schemas for our database. We can even customise the schema if we want. Also it loads sample data to our database so that we can try out our queries on those data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--01K4uing--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2940a7xgkdhd29q5lfux.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--01K4uing--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2940a7xgkdhd29q5lfux.png" alt="Prisma cloud Schema"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this blog, I would be using the &lt;strong&gt;URL Shortener template&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the schema has been created, it pushes the &lt;code&gt;schema.prisma&lt;/code&gt; file to the GitHub Repository and also adds a &lt;code&gt;Readme.md&lt;/code&gt; file to the repo which contains all the instructions for setting up and running the project locally and also the Database &lt;strong&gt;ER diagram&lt;/strong&gt; for ready reference like the one shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bagEBXP1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7i1s3dpt7vp09t54gjvl.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bagEBXP1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7i1s3dpt7vp09t54gjvl.png" alt="ER Diagram"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ER Diagram is generated using:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/notiz-dev/prisma-dbml-generator"&gt;Prisma DBML Generator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://dbdiagram.io"&gt;DBDiagram.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prisma-on-cloud-functionalities"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Prisma on Cloud Functionalities
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prisma on cloud contains several functionalities such as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guide to Local Setup &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data browser (Prisma Studio)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Query Console&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#local-setup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Local Setup
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prisma on Cloud gives a robust documentation to setup the same project on your local development environment with the option to setup local database or connect to a remote database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3XTbWWNM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oofuuhdyi4nj6xaw0hlc.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3XTbWWNM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oofuuhdyi4nj6xaw0hlc.png" alt="Local Setup"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#data-browser"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Data Browser
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prisma on Cloud provides &lt;strong&gt;Prisma Studio&lt;/strong&gt; out of the box for data browsing on cloud. It helps developers edit data in database tables without a local database client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DZPTjux4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pvvh6i1tp2uwuxvv6u4g.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DZPTjux4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pvvh6i1tp2uwuxvv6u4g.png" alt="Prisma Studio"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#query-console"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Query Console
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The query console is the heart of Prisma Data Platform. It allows us to write and try out complex queries on the sample dataset. It can even serve as a scratch pad for your queries during the development phase of your application. It helps to instantly get output of a query without having to write APIs and console logs for the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uZqRuS2q--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9j0or271u8twymp0dcip.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uZqRuS2q--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9j0or271u8twymp0dcip.png" alt="Query Console"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Query console supports code highlighting, auto complete, auto saves queries and also code linting features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#collaborate-with-users"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Collaborate with users
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prisma on cloud also allows developers to collaborate with fellow developers, just by inviting a GitHub user to the Prisma Project. It also gives various types of permissions for collaborators such as Admin, Developer, Viewer etc which grants restricted access to the Prisma project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q9JFz33---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c4knd0rcj6i7b35a6pko.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q9JFz33---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c4knd0rcj6i7b35a6pko.png" alt="Collaborate"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admins can even modify access of collaborators and can remove them from project if at some point they think it's necessary to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#whats-next-for-prisma-data-platform"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What's next for Prisma Data Platform?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for other database dialects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple environments support to facilitate and organise projects and initiate workflows between them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insights such as query times, generated SQL Script about the Query ran in the Query console&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Telemetry events integration from Prisma queries to 3rd party external services supporting Open Telemetry Framework&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insights about list of queries in the application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Please note: All the above mentioned points are subject to change and are not guaranteed]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following Laravel project/directory structure represents a personal boilerplate modular/SOA structure that I use most of the time when starting a new Laravel project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found myself creating the same structure multiple times during the past couple of months so I decided to create a boilerplate project starter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#core-structure"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Core structure
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Core module contains the main interfaces, abstract classes and implementations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#directory-overview"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Directory overview
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#interfaces"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Interfaces
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main interface is the &lt;strong&gt;RepositoryInterface&lt;/strong&gt; which has the basic CRUD and some additional methods defined.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;App\Modules\Core\Interfaces&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;RepositoryInterface&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * @return mixed
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;findAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * @param int $id
     * @return mixed
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;findById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * @param string $column
     * @param $value
     * @return mixed
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;findBy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$column&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * @param array $data
     * @return mixed
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * @param int $id
     * @param array $data
     * @return mixed
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;


    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * @param int $id
     * @return mixed
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;delete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Repository&lt;/strong&gt; class that implements the &lt;strong&gt;RepositoryInterface&lt;/strong&gt; looks like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;App\Modules\Core\Repositories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;App\Modules\Core\Interfaces\RepositoryInterface&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Repository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;RepositoryInterface&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * Model::class
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * @return mixed
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;findAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * @param int $id
     * @return mixed
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;findById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * @param string $column
     * @param $value
     * @return mixed
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;findBy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$column&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$column&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * @param array $data
     * @return mixed
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;fresh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;findById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;fill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;save&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;fresh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * @param int $id
     * @return mixed|void
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;delete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;destroy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The other two interfaces are &lt;strong&gt;SearchInterface&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;FilterInterface&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;SearchInterface&lt;/strong&gt; defines one method, this interface can be implemented by a specific Repository class per Module when there is a need for a Search filter while retrieving data from the database.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;App\Modules\Core\Interfaces&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;SearchInterface&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * @param array $request
     * @return mixed
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;search&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Example implementation of the &lt;strong&gt;SearchInterface&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;App\Modules\Example\Repositories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ExampleRepository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Repository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ExampleInterface&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;SearchInterface&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * @var string
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$model&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * @param array $request
     * @return mixed
     * @throws ExampleSearchException
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;search&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$query&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;filterBy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;orderBy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'order_by'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;??&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'id'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'sort'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;??&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'desc'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;paginate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'per_page'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;??&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;getPerPage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ExampleSearchException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This can be further abstracted, but I will handle that in some future release 😄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the &lt;strong&gt;FilterInterface&lt;/strong&gt; defines only one method and this interface is implemented per Filter class per module if there is a need for filtering by specific request key.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;App\Modules\Core\Interfaces&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;FilterInterface&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * @param $value
     * @return mixed
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;handle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Example implementation of the &lt;strong&gt;FilterInterface&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;App\Modules\Example\Filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;App\Modules\Core\Filters\QueryFilter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;App\Modules\Core\Interfaces\FilterInterface&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;QueryFilter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;FilterInterface&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * @param $value
     * @return mixed|void
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;handle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'name'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'like'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'%'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'%'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#exceptions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Exceptions
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Exceptions&lt;/strong&gt; directory contains the General exceptions that have some predefined &lt;em&gt;$code&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;$message&lt;/em&gt; for the exception, this can be overridden when the custom exception per Module extends the General Exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example in the provided Module &lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt; there are multiple exceptions defined&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#examplenotfoundexception"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ExampleNotFoundException
&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;App\Modules\Example\Exceptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;App\Modules\Core\Exceptions\GeneralNotFoundException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ExampleNotFoundException&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;GeneralNotFoundException&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This extends the &lt;strong&gt;GeneralNotFoundException&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;App\Modules\Core\Exceptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;GeneralNotFoundException&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;GeneralException&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;404&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * @return string|null
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;?string&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"The requested resource was not found in the database"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#requests"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Requests
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Requests&lt;/strong&gt; directory contains the General Form Request abstract classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main &lt;strong&gt;FormRequest&lt;/strong&gt; class overrides the &lt;em&gt;failedValidation&lt;/em&gt; method from &lt;em&gt;src/Illuminate/Foundation/Http/FormRequest.php&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;abstract&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;FormRequest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;LaravelFormRequest&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * Handle a failed validation attempt.
     *
     * @param Validator $validator
     * @return void
     *
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;protected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;failedValidation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Validator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$validator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$errors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ValidationException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$validator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;HttpResponseException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nf"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'errors'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;HTTP_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then each of the other abstract Form Request classes extends this abstract &lt;strong&gt;FormRequest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#createformrequest"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  CreateFormRequest
&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;App\Modules\Core\Requests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;abstract&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;CreateFormRequest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;FormRequest&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;protected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$table&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * Determine if the user is authorized to make this request.
     *
     * @return bool
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;authorize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * Get the validation rules that apply to the request.
     *
     * @return array
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;abstract&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now when the abstract &lt;strong&gt;CreateFormRequest&lt;/strong&gt; is extended in a Module, the class that extends this will have to implement the abstract method &lt;em&gt;rules()&lt;/em&gt; where the validation rules are defined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#createexamplerequest"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  CreateExampleRequest
&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;App\Modules\Example\Requests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;App\Modules\Core\Requests\CreateFormRequest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Illuminate\Validation\Rule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;CreateExampleRequest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;CreateFormRequest&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;protected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$table&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'examples'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * @inheritDoc
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'name'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'required'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'string'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Rule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;unique&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'name'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'example_type_id'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'required'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Rule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;exists&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'example_types'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'id'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'is_active'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'sometimes'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'boolean'&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#traits"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Traits
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Traits&lt;/strong&gt; directory contains the core traits used in the modules. The &lt;em&gt;ApiResponses&lt;/em&gt; trait is where the default structure is defined for the Json responses for error and success&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some methods defined there&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * @param Exception $exception
     * @param array $data
     * @param string $title
     * @return JsonResponse
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;exceptionRespond&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Error'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;JsonResponse&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'title'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'message'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;getMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'code'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;getCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;getCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * @param $data
     * @return JsonResponse
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;respond&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;JsonResponse&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'message'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'code'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;responseCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'data'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$data&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;responseCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To get the general idea of the Core structure please clone the repository or create new composer project&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/keljtanoski/modular-laravel.git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;composer create-project keljtanoski/modular-laravel
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#example-module-structure"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Example module structure
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an example module ready to be used. The general purpose of this module is to be demonstrate the interaction between the interface, repository and the service, it can be easily duplicated and with simple search and replace you can have new module up and running very fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#directory-overview"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Directory overview
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#controllers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Controllers
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Controllers&lt;/strong&gt; directory holds the controllers for the module. &lt;em&gt;ExamplesController&lt;/em&gt; is used for the WEB endpoints and the &lt;em&gt;Api/ExamplesController&lt;/em&gt; is used for the API endpoints&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#apiexamplescontroller"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Api/ExamplesController
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;exampleService&lt;/em&gt; is injected through the constructor.&lt;br&gt;
This service is responsible for delegating the action required to a Repository class that implements the &lt;em&gt;ExampleInterface&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;App\Modules\Example\Controllers\Api&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ExamplesController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ApiController&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * @var ExampleService
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;protected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$exampleService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**

     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;__construct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;ExampleService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$exampleService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;exampleService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$exampleService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#examplescontroller"&gt;

  ExamplesController
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WEB - ExamplesController has the standard methods : &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;index()&lt;/em&gt; - returns all the resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;create()&lt;/em&gt; - returns view for creating a resource&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;store()&lt;/em&gt; - stores the data from the create form&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;edit()&lt;/em&gt; - returns view for editing a resource&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;update()&lt;/em&gt; - updates the resource with the form data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;destroy()&lt;/em&gt; - destroys a resource&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same &lt;em&gt;ExampleService&lt;/em&gt; is used and injected through the constructor.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;__construct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;ExampleService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$exampleService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * Display a listing of the resource.

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#services"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Services
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Services&lt;/strong&gt; directory contains the service classes used in a module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;ExampleInterface&lt;/em&gt; is injected through the constructor, this interface is bind to an implementation via a &lt;em&gt;RepositoryServiceProvider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

            &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;bind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$interface&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$repository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$repository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;ExampleService&lt;/em&gt; class from this module is structured like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;App\Modules\Example\Services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ExampleService&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$exampleRepository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;__construct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;ExampleInterface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$exampleRepository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;exampleRepository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$exampleRepository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Methods already defined in the &lt;em&gt;ExampleService&lt;/em&gt; are the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#getbyid-method"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;getById()&lt;/em&gt; method
&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * @param int $id
     * @return mixed
     * @throws ExampleNotFoundException
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;getById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;exampleRepository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;findById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ExampleNotFoundException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#getall-method"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;getAll()&lt;/em&gt; method
&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;exampleRepository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;findAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#search-method"&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To get the general idea of the Module structure please clone the repository or create new composer project&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/keljtanoski/modular-laravel.git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;composer create-project keljtanoski/modular-laravel
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#route-list"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Route List
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just an output of the &lt;code&gt;php artisan route:list&lt;/code&gt; command&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

+----------+---------------------------+---------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------+

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#final-thoughts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Final thoughts
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each module represents a Use Case, but they can be combined into a Domain, for example &lt;em&gt;Modules/CMS&lt;/em&gt; can have the following "sub-modules" : Post, Tag, Category etc. I will make an update about this once I have the demo implemented. I am also working on implementing &lt;em&gt;Presenters&lt;/em&gt; and adding &lt;em&gt;Tests&lt;/em&gt; so that will also be described in the next release. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Please let me know what you think in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are welcome to suggest changes to the repository by submitting a pull-request. Your contribution is much appreciated&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This implementation was inspired by &lt;a href="https://github.com/nWidart/laravel-modules"&gt;nWidart/laravel-modules&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The design industry is probably one of the fastest growing. New and creative websites are being created every day, pushing the limitations of HTML &amp;amp; CSS in every direction.&lt;br&gt;
CSS has come a long way from formatting the structured content. It was used to control layout of documents precisely and to apply different layouts to media types. Modern web sites are designed to provide various types of interactions with users. CSS3 effects are used in most of those situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give designers more flexibility and interoperability, CSS3 is proposed as the next major revision of CSS. In this showcase below you’ll find some of the best handpicked free HTML CSS3 Social Media Buttons which might handy for your design projects or your own website.&lt;br&gt;
You can find numerous amount of free design stuff online. Finding free code snippets are also not very difficult, but it’s very time-consuming to find the correct design element that follows the current design trends. This list may help you to enrich your knowledge as well as your site’s user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Your first Introduction to Django REST framework</title>
      <author>Eric The Coder</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 01:59:06 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/ericchapman/your-first-introduction-to-django-rest-framework-2lbl</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/ericchapman/your-first-introduction-to-django-rest-framework-2lbl</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A web developer worthy of the name must be able to create a REST API. This article will help you understand everything there is to know to build your first API using the Python language and the Django REST Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To not miss anything, click Follow and/or follow me on Twitter: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EricTheCoder_"&gt;https://twitter.com/EricTheCoder_&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-an-api"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is an API?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;API stands for Application Programming Interface, a software solution that allows two applications to communicate with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of web development, the application that runs in the browser called 'frontend' communicates/sends a request to the server called 'backend'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#example"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Example
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose the frontend application wants the list of all the articles of a blog, it could send an HTTP request to the server.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;GET https://www.myblog.com/posts
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Django server will process this request, read the database, and return the list of articles in JSON (structured text) format. This list could then be processed and displayed in the frontend app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can Django know how to handle this request? In fact, he cannot. It won't know what to do with the query. That's why we need to create an API. That is a server application that will determine how to respond to different requests about a specific resource. In this case the blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that all requests to the servers are made via HTTP actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#http-requests"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  HTTP requests
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action you want to perform on the indicated resource. Although nouns are also encountered, these methods are often referred to as HTTP verbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#here-are-the-most-commonly-used-http-verbsactions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Here are the most commonly used HTTP verbs/actions
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GET:&lt;br&gt;
The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. GET requests should only be used to retrieve data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;POST:&lt;br&gt;
The POST method is used to send an entity to the indicated resource. This usually results in a state change or side effects on the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PUT:&lt;br&gt;
The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the content of the request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PATCH:&lt;br&gt;
The PATCH method is used to apply partial changes to a resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DELETE:&lt;br&gt;
The DELETE method deletes the indicated resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#end-of-the-theory"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  End of the theory
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theory is fine, but it is much easier to understand a concept by putting it into practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are therefore going in the following sections to create a REST API with Django.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prerequisites-installation-of-python-and-django"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Prerequisites: Installation of Python and Django.
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest version of Python can be downloaded here: &lt;a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/"&gt;https://www.python.org/downloads/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow the instructions on this site according to your operating system (MAC, Windows or Linux)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To check if Python is correctly installed you can run this command from your terminal&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;python3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;version&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Python 3.9.6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#virtual-environment"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Virtual environment
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When working on a Python project, we have to work with several libraries such as Django and Django REST Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the date of creation of the project. It is possible for example that the Django REST Framework library is not exactly at the same version number in all other projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to allow each project to have its own version of Python and its own versions of libraries?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be using virtual environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python provides you with a system that allows you to create virtual environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the environment has been created and activated, all the libraries installed can be used only in the environment to which they belong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-create-a-virtual-environment"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to create a virtual environment
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally we place a virtual environment in the project folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create and access a folder for our project&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir myblog
cd myblog
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From this folder, you can now create the virtual environment that will be attached to the project&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;python3 -m venv env
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here we run python3 with the module option venv (-m venv). env is the name we give to our virtual environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once created you can activate it&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;source env / bin / activate
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That's it that's all! You now have a Python virtual environment created for your project. Normally the terminal will tell you that your environment is activated by displaying its name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that to deactivate the virtual environment you must run&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;deactivate
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installing-django"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installing Django
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the myblog project folder and with the virtual environment enabled run the following install command:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip install django
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;and&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip install djangorestframework
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact from this point on, every time I ask you to execute a command in the terminal, I will assume that you are in the project folder 'myblog' and that the virtual environment is activated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#project-creation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Project creation
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Django allows you to create a project configuration and then several applications associated with this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the 'myblog' project could have an application for managing posts and another application for managing comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each application shares the same project configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a Django command to create a project configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run the following command:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;django-admin startproject config.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 'startproject' command creates a project configuration with the name 'config'. Point '.' specifies that we want the project to be created in the current folder&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may seem strange to you that the name 'config' was chosen for the project. In fact, it makes sense, because it is about the configuration of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-the-application"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating the application
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 'config' project is only the configuration part. To add functions to your project, you must create one or more applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this, run this command:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;djangoadmin startapp posts
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 'startapp' command creates an application with the name 'posts'. It is in this application that we will create our API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 'config' project and the 'posts' application have been created with a folder structure and files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of the files created:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4oLizia3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630084492552/Eu03meXBE.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4oLizia3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630084492552/Eu03meXBE.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-08-27 at 1.14.38 PM.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these folders and files might sound like a lot, but don't worry, they are there to simplify application development. I will explain them in due course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last little point, we need to add the following lines of code to the project configuration file 'config' settings.py&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;# config / settings / py

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    ...

    'rest_framework',
    'rest_framework.authtoken',
    'posts',
]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here we indicate to the project that we want to use these three applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rest_framework: will allow us to create our API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rest_framework.authtoken: will allow us to add security to our API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;posts tell Django to use our posts app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creation-of-our-first-api"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creation of our first API
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step is to create the Django data model that will contain our blog posts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open the 'models.py' file in the 'posts' application folder and enter the following code&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# posts / models.py
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;django.db&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;django.contrib.auth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;get_user_model&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;get_user_model&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;CharField&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;max_length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;TextField&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;created_on&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;DateTimeField&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;auto_now_add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ForeignKey&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;on_delete&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;CASCADE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Note that with each Django project there is a User model and authentication libraries created automatically. The User model contains among others the fields: username, email, first_name, last_name, and password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use 'User = get_user_model ()' in order to retrieve the reference to this model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, this 'models.py' file will serve as an instruction for Django to create a database that will contain a table and fields with the same definitions as in this file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create the database, you must create a migration file. The migration file is the plan, the "blueprint" of what the database must contain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Django allows to automatically create this migration file with the following command&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ python manage.py makemigrations
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once the migration file is created, we can run it and Django will create a database with the instructions contained in the migration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The command to start the migration is as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ python manage.py migrate
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, it is necessary to create our first user. Django provides us with a command to create a superuser&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ python manage.py createsuperuser
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This command will ask you for the username, email, and password to then create the user&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#add-the-post-template-to-the-admin-panel"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Add the Post template to the admin panel
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use the Post model from the Django Admin Panel you need to add the following code&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# posts / admin.py
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;django.contrib&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;admin&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;posts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;admin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;site&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;register&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#visit-the-admin-panel"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Visit the Admin Panel
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to make sure that everything we have done has worked, start the server and visit the Admin Panel&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ python manage.py runserver
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The runserver command will launch a Django server&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To access the Admin Panel, visit: &lt;a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/"&gt;http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A page will ask for username and password&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---iqE9WFr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630325697926/zco8g0Her.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---iqE9WFr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630325697926/zco8g0Her.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-08-30 at 8.14.07 AM.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you should see a page with the Groups, Users, and Posts tables&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EBC8bAGE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630325709787/bmhjCnvHa.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EBC8bAGE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630325709787/bmhjCnvHa.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-08-30 at 8.14.33 AM.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#understanding-the-logic-of-django-restframework"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Understanding the logic of Django rest-framework
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Django rest-framework provides you with libraries that allow you to create an API from A to Z. The rest-framework uses a certain logic that you will need to understand if you want to create an API&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-do-you-want-to-create-as-an-api"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What do you want to create as an API?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The API we want to create is in fact an interface to read, create and modify posts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the 6 actions and URLs we want to create:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the list of all our articles: GET api/posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read a specific article: GET api/posts/1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an article: POST api/posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit an article: PUT api/posts/1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partially modify an article: PATCH api/posts/1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delete an article: DELETE api/posts/1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#data-exchange-format"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Data exchange format
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exchange of data between the backend and the frontend is done in structured text format in JSON format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest-framework, therefore, provides a object for the conversion between the Django format and a JSON compatible format. This conversion uses the Serializer class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-a-serializer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Create a Serializer
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step is therefore to create a serializer. To do this create a file named serializers.py under the application posts folder and add these lines of code:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# posts / serializers.py
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rest_framework&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;serializers&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;.models&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;PostSerializer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;serializers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ModelSerializer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Meta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;fields&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'__all__'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There you have it, it’s no more complicated! In fact, most of the work is done by the rest-framework library. Here, we just have to mention which template and which fields we want to use for the API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that instead of '&lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt;' you could have specified the name of each desired fields&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fields&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'title'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'body'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-the-view"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Create the view
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the serializer is created, nothing prevents us from creating the API for the Post model&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#apiview-vs-viewset"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ApiView vs ViewSet
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Django REST Framework allows you to create our API logic using two different techniques:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#apiview"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ApiView
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the ApiView class is the longest technique to create an API, but it allows for a great deal of customization. If you have special needs, the ApiView is your option of choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#viewset"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ViewSet
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the ViewSet class is the fastest technique to create an API based on a Django model linked to a database. The ViewSet class will create for you the 7 actions most often used when creating an API: list, create, retrieve, update, partial_update, and destroy. It is therefore much faster than creating each action manually as with the APIView. On the other hand, if you have very specific needs, it will not be possible to customize your API as much as with the APIView&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#apiview-or-viewset-for-our-project"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  APIView or ViewSet for our project?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we are going to create an API based on a Django model and it will be without much customization, I chose to use ViewSets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the views.py file in the posts application folder. Enter the following code:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rest_framework&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;viewsets&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;.models&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;.serializers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;PostSerializer&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;PostViewSet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;viewsets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ModelViewSet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;serializer_class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;PostSerializer&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;queryset&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;objects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Again, you have a demonstration of the strength of rest-framework. Just create a view based on the 'ModelViewSet' and then specify which serializer is and where the data will come from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this simple code you will have access to 6 actions all inherited from ModelViewSets and its 6 equivalent methods: list, create, retrieve, update, partial_update, and destroy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the 6 views are available via PostViewSet, you must create a URL path for each of the 6 views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-url-path"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Create URL path
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have the views now there is only one step left and that is to create a URL path to access these 6 actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, no need to create 6 routes manually, rest-framework provides us with the Router class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a urls.py file under the posts app folder&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# posts / urls.py
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;django.urls&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;include&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;rest_framework.routers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;DefaultRouter&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;.views&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;PostViewSet&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;DefaultRouter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;register&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'posts'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;PostViewSet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'post'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;urlpatterns&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;urls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)),&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This code will create the following 6 URL path:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GET / posts (display the list view)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GET / posts/1 (display the post with id = 1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;POST / posts (create)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PUT / posts/1 (update)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PATCH / posts/1 (partial update)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DELETE / posts/1 (Destroy post with id = 1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All you need is to connect these roads to your project. To do this, enter the following code in the urls.py file under the config project&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;django.contrib&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;admin&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;django.urls&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;include&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;urlpatterns&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'admin /'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;admin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;site&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;urls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'api /'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'profiles_api.urls'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)),&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The routes created under posts / urls.py will all be used under the URL API /&lt;br&gt;
Ex. Api / posts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it's time to test everything by launching the server&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ python manage.py runserver
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then visit the address: &lt;a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/api"&gt;http://127.0.0.1:8000/api&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vL0y90i1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630344714905/PuqVfi8d6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vL0y90i1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630344714905/PuqVfi8d6.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-08-30 at 1.31.01 PM.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This page is created automatically by the rest-framework in order to allow you to test your API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you click on the API "posts". Another page will open with the list of all your posts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ChculPbo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630344783422/JzFBL_Z4W.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ChculPbo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630344783422/JzFBL_Z4W.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-08-30 at 1.31.16 PM.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is now possible to use this rest-framework interface to test the 6 actions and URLs paths that we created earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#end-of-the-first-part"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  End of the first part
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's all for today. In the next part, we will discuss authentication with tokens and the protection of certain actions / URLs&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Build a reinforcement learning environment using Unity ML-Agents</title>
      <author>Joy</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 01:16:57 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/joooyz/build-a-reinforcement-learning-environment-using-unity-ml-agents-112e</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/joooyz/build-a-reinforcement-learning-environment-using-unity-ml-agents-112e</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This article is part 2 of the series '&lt;a href="https://dev.to/joooyz/a-hands-on-introduction-to-deep-reinforcement-learning-using-unity-ml-agents-4f8i"&gt;A hands-on introduction to deep reinforcement learning using Unity ML-Agents&lt;/a&gt;'. It's also suitable for anyone new to Unity interested in using ML-Agents for their own reinforcement learning project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#recap-and-overview"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Recap and overview
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href="https://dev.to/joooyz/an-introduction-to-machine-learning-with-unity-ml-agents-3an5"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I went over how to set up ML-Agents and train an agent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, I'll walk through how to build a 3D physics-based volleyball environment in Unity. We'll use this environment later to train agents that can successfully play volleyball using deep reinforcement learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setting-up-the-court"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setting up the court
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download or clone the starter project from this &lt;a href="https://github.com/CoderOneHQ/ultimate-volleyball-starter"&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Unity Hub and go to Projects &amp;gt; Add.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the 'ultimate-volleyball-starter' project folder. You might see some warning messages in the Console but they are safe to ignore for now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the &lt;strong&gt;Project&lt;/strong&gt; tab in Unity, navigate to &lt;strong&gt;Assets&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Scenes.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Load the &lt;code&gt;Volleyball.unity&lt;/code&gt; scene.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;Project&lt;/strong&gt; tab go to &lt;strong&gt;Assets&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Prefabs&lt;/strong&gt; and drag the &lt;code&gt;VolleyballArea.prefab&lt;/code&gt; object into the scene.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tiFJZb82--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dgtv5cxa19a3h04qaj9t.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tiFJZb82--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dgtv5cxa19a3h04qaj9t.gif" alt="add-prefab-to-scene.gif" title="Dragging prefab into the Volleyball scene"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you click &lt;strong&gt;Play&lt;/strong&gt; ▶️ above the Scene viewer you'll notice some weird things happening because we haven't added any physics or logic to define how the game objects should interact yet. We'll do that in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setting-up-the-environment"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setting up the environment
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⚠ Before we start, open the &lt;strong&gt;VolleyballArea prefab&lt;/strong&gt; (Project panel &amp;gt; Assets &amp;gt; Prefabs). We'll make our edits to the base prefab, so that they are reflected in all instances of this prefab. This will come in handy later when we duplicate our environment multiple times for parallel training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--t0bEIpLK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/830nbzhz2ffghu4bpnk8.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--t0bEIpLK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/830nbzhz2ffghu4bpnk8.JPG" alt="prefab-view.JPG" title="Editing a Prefab in Unity"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#volleyball"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Volleyball&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make our volleyball subject to Unity's physics engine:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;Hierarchy&lt;/strong&gt; panel, expand the &lt;strong&gt;VolleyballArea&lt;/strong&gt; object and select the &lt;strong&gt;Volleyball&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the &lt;strong&gt;Inspector&lt;/strong&gt; panel, set the tag to &lt;code&gt;ball&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click &lt;strong&gt;Add Component&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;RigidBody&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set mass = 3, drag = 1 and angular drag = 1. Feel free to play around with default values. A heavier ball will make the environment 'harder'.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Add 'bounciness' to our ball:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a &lt;strong&gt;Sphere Collider&lt;/strong&gt; component.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Radius to 0.15.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the &lt;strong&gt;Project&lt;/strong&gt; panel, go to &lt;strong&gt;Assets&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Materials &amp;gt; Physic Materials&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drag  &lt;code&gt;Bouncy.physicMaterial&lt;/code&gt; into the 'Material' slot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can double-click &lt;code&gt;Bouncy.physicMaterial&lt;/code&gt; to change the 'bounciness'.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---britNaf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yavr4myfoqciyniltfan.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---britNaf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yavr4myfoqciyniltfan.jpg" alt="volleyball-components.jpg" title="Inspector panel for Volleyball object"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both blue and purple agent cubes have already been set up for you in a similar way to the Volleyball.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ground"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Ground&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the &lt;strong&gt;Ground&lt;/strong&gt; game object&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the &lt;strong&gt;Inspector&lt;/strong&gt; panel, set the tag to &lt;code&gt;walkableSurface&lt;/code&gt;. This is used later to check whether or not the agent is 'grounded' for its jump action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a &lt;strong&gt;Box Collider&lt;/strong&gt; component. This is used to register collisions with other game objects containing Rigid Body components. Without it, they will just fall through the ground.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#goals"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Goals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goals are represented by a thin layer on top of the ground. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expand the &lt;strong&gt;BluePlayArea&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;PurplePlayArea&lt;/strong&gt; parent objects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a &lt;strong&gt;Box Collider&lt;/strong&gt; to both the &lt;strong&gt;BlueGoal&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;PurpleGoal&lt;/strong&gt; game objects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the 'Is Trigger' box for both goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--87iJBD5a--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gad8t0dnfcoufaw3gm7z.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--87iJBD5a--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gad8t0dnfcoufaw3gm7z.JPG" alt="collider-is-trigger.JPG" title="Trigger setting checked in Inspector panel"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a game object is set as a trigger, it no longer registers any physics-based collisions. Even though the goals are placed above the ground layer, technically the agents are moving on the Ground layer collider we created earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting triggers allows us to use the  &lt;code&gt;OnTriggerEnter&lt;/code&gt; method later which will detect when a ball has hit the collider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#net"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Net&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the &lt;strong&gt;Net&lt;/strong&gt; game object within &lt;strong&gt;VolleyballNet&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a &lt;strong&gt;Box Collider&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the '&lt;strong&gt;Edit Collider&lt;/strong&gt;' icon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click and drag the bottom node of the green collider so that it covers the entire height of the net. Feel free to play around with the thickness. The intention here is to create a physical 'blocker' that will prevent the ball from going under or around the net.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kL6wgKiZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hxrspqoxb01b2p3aswdf.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kL6wgKiZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hxrspqoxb01b2p3aswdf.gif" alt="net-collider.gif" title="Adjusting collider of net"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;💡 Some shortcuts: Alt+click to rotate, middle-click to pan, middle mouse wheel to zoom in/out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#boundaries"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three invisible boundaries:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;OuterBoundaries&lt;/strong&gt; (checks for ball going out of bounds)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BlueBoundary&lt;/strong&gt; (checks for ball going into the blue side of court)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;PurpleBoundary&lt;/strong&gt; (checks for ball going into the purple side of court)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colliders, tags, and triggers for these boundaries have already been set up for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#scripting-the-environment"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Scripting the environment
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section, we'll add scripts that define the environment behavior (e.g. what happens when the ball hits the floor or when the episode starts).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-volleyballsettingscs-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;VolleyballSettings.cs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first script will simply hold some constants that we'll reuse throughout the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go back to the &lt;strong&gt;Volleyball&lt;/strong&gt; Scene and select the &lt;strong&gt;VolleyballSettings&lt;/strong&gt; game object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;Inspector&lt;/strong&gt;, you'll see a Script component attached. Double click the &lt;strong&gt;VolleyballSettings&lt;/strong&gt; script to open it in your IDE of choice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should see the following:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;agentRunSpeed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1.5f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;agentJumpHeight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2.75f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;agentJumpVelocity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;777&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;agentJumpVelocityMaxChange&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Slows down strafe &amp;amp; backward movement&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;speedReductionFactor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.75f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Material&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;blueGoalMaterial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Material&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;purpleGoalMaterial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Material&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;defaultMaterial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// This is a downward force applied when falling to make jumps look less floaty&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fallingForce&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;150&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; there is also a &lt;code&gt;ProjectSettingsOverride.cs&lt;/code&gt; script provided. This contains additional default settings related to time-stepping and resolving physics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go back to the Unity editor and select the &lt;strong&gt;VolleyballSettings&lt;/strong&gt; game object. You should see that these variables are available in the &lt;strong&gt;Inspector&lt;/strong&gt; panel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-volleyballcontrollercs-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;VolleyballController.cs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This script is attached to the &lt;strong&gt;Volleyball&lt;/strong&gt; game object and lets us detect when the ball has hit our boundary or goal trigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the &lt;code&gt;VolleyballController.cs&lt;/code&gt; script attached to the Volleyball.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the start of our &lt;code&gt;VolleyballController : MonoBehaviour&lt;/code&gt; class (above the &lt;code&gt;Start()&lt;/code&gt; method), declare the variables:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HideInInspector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;VolleyballEnvController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;envController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;GameObject&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;purpleGoal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;GameObject&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;blueGoal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Collider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;purpleGoalCollider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Collider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;blueGoalCollider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the script.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Unity editor, click the &lt;strong&gt;Volleyball&lt;/strong&gt; game object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drag the &lt;strong&gt;PurpleGoal&lt;/strong&gt; game object into the Purple Goal slot in the Inspector. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drag the &lt;strong&gt;BlueGoal&lt;/strong&gt; game object into the Blue Goal slot in the Inspector.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--loM1A4hc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tccf32d1gc9q3loz2ri5.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--loM1A4hc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tccf32d1gc9q3loz2ri5.JPG" alt="volleyball-controller.JPG" title="Script component for Volleyball object"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will allow us to access their child objects later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Start()&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This method is called when the environment is first rendered. It will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fetch the PurpleGoal &amp;amp; BlueGoal Colliders themselves (the components that register physics-based collisions) using the &lt;code&gt;GetComponent&amp;lt;Collider&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; method:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;purpleGoalCollider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;purpleGoal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;GetComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Collider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;blueGoalCollider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;blueGoal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;GetComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Collider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assign the parent &lt;strong&gt;VolleyballArea&lt;/strong&gt; game object to a variable 'envController' for easier reference later.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;envController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;GetComponentInParent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;VolleyballEnvController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Copy these statements into the &lt;code&gt;Start()&lt;/code&gt; method:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;envController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;GetComponentInParent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;VolleyballEnvController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;purpleGoalCollider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;purpleGoal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;GetComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Collider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;blueGoalCollider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;blueGoal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;GetComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Collider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This method is called when the ball hits a collider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some scenarios to detect are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ball hits the floor/goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ball goes out of bounds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ball is hit over the net (to encourage volleying for training later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This method will detect each scenario and pass this information to &lt;code&gt;envController&lt;/code&gt; (which we'll add in the next section). Copy the following block into this method:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gameObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;CompareTag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"boundary"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ball went out of bounds&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;envController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;ResolveEvent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HitOutOfBounds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gameObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;CompareTag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"blueBoundary"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ball hit into blue side&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;envController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;ResolveEvent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HitIntoBlueArea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gameObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;CompareTag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"purpleBoundary"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ball hit into purple side&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;envController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;ResolveEvent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HitIntoPurpleArea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gameObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;CompareTag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"purpleGoal"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ball hit purple goal (blue side court)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;envController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;ResolveEvent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HitPurpleGoal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gameObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;CompareTag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"blueGoal"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ball hit blue goal (purple side court)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;envController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;ResolveEvent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HitBlueGoal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-volleyballenvcontrollercs-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;VolleyballEnvController.cs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This script holds all the main logic for the environment: the max steps it should run for, how the ball and agents should spawn, when the episode should end, how rewards should be assigned, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the sample skeleton script, some variables and helper methods are already provided:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Start()&lt;/code&gt; — fetch the components and objects we'll need for later&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;UpdateLastHitter()&lt;/code&gt; — keeps track of which agent was last in control of the ball&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;GoalScoredSwapGroundMaterial()&lt;/code&gt; — changes the color of the ground (helps us visualise which agent scored)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;FixedUpdate()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is called by the Unity engine each time there is a frame update (which is set to every &lt;code&gt;FixedDeltaTime=0.02&lt;/code&gt; seconds in &lt;code&gt;ProjectSettingsOverride.cs&lt;/code&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will control the max number of updates (i.e. 'steps') the environment takes before we interrupt the episode (e.g. if the ball gets stuck somewhere).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the following to &lt;code&gt;void FixedUpdate()&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;/// &amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;/// Called every step. Control max env steps.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;/// &amp;lt;/summary&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;FixedUpdate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;resetTimer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;resetTimer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;MaxEnvironmentSteps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;MaxEnvironmentSteps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;blueAgent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;EpisodeInterrupted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;purpleAgent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;EpisodeInterrupted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nf"&gt;ResetScene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ResetScene()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This controls the starting spawn behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to learn a model that allows our agent to return the ball from its side of the court no matter where the ball is sent. To help with training, we'll randomise the starting conditions of the agents and ball within some reasonable boundaries:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;/// &amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;/// Reset agent and ball spawn conditions.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;/// &amp;lt;/summary&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;ResetScene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;resetTimer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;lastHitter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Team&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// reset last hitter&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;foreach&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;agent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;AgentsList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// randomise starting positions and rotations&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kt"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;randomPosX&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;2f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kt"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;randomPosZ&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;2f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kt"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;randomPosY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0.5f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;3.75f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// depends on jump height&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kt"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;randomRot&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;45f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;45f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;agent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;localPosition&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Vector3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;randomPosX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;randomPosY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;randomPosZ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;agent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;eulerAngles&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Vector3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;randomRot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;agent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;GetComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Rigidbody&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;velocity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Vector3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// reset ball to starting conditions&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;ResetBall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;/// &amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;/// Reset ball spawn conditions&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;/// &amp;lt;/summary&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;ResetBall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kt"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;randomPosX&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;2f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kt"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;randomPosZ&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;6f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kt"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;randomPosY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;6f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;8f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// alternate ball spawn side&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// -1 = spawn blue side, 1 = spawn purple side&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;ballSpawnSide&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ballSpawnSide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ballSpawnSide&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;ball&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;localPosition&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Vector3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;randomPosX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;randomPosY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;randomPosZ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ballSpawnSide&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;ball&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;localPosition&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Vector3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;randomPosX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;randomPosY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;randomPosZ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;ballRb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;angularVelocity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Vector3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;zero&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;ballRb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;velocity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Vector3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;zero&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ResolveEvent()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This method will resolve the scenarios we defined earlier in &lt;code&gt;VolleyballController.cs&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can use this method to assign rewards in different ways to encourage different types of behavior. In general, it's good practise to keep rewards within [-1,1]. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep it simple, our goal for now is to train agents that can bounce the ball back and forth and keep the ball in play. We'll assign a reward of +1 each time an agent hits the ball over the net using the &lt;code&gt;AddReward(1f)&lt;/code&gt; method in the corresponding scenario:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HitIntoBlueArea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lastHitter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Team&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Purple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;purpleAgent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;AddReward&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HitIntoPurpleArea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lastHitter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Team&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Blue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;blueAgent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;AddReward&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We won't assign any rewards for now if a goal is scored or the ball is hit out of bounds. If either of these scenarios happen, we'll just end the episode. Add the following code block to the sections indicated by the &lt;code&gt;// end episode&lt;/code&gt; comment.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;blueAgent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;EndEpisode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;purpleAgent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;EndEpisode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nf"&gt;ResetScene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here's what &lt;code&gt;ResolveEvent&lt;/code&gt; should look like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;/// &amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;/// Resolves scenarios when ball enters a trigger and assigns rewards&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;/// &amp;lt;/summary&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;ResolveEvent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Event&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;triggerEvent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;switch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;triggerEvent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HitOutOfBounds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lastHitter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Team&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Blue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// apply penalty to blue agent&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lastHitter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Team&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Purple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// apply penalty to purple agent&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// end episode&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;blueAgent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;EndEpisode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;purpleAgent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;EndEpisode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nf"&gt;ResetScene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HitBlueGoal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// blue wins&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// turn floor blue&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nf"&gt;StartCoroutine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;GoalScoredSwapGroundMaterial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;volleyballSettings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;blueGoalMaterial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;RenderersList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;5f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// end episode&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;blueAgent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;EndEpisode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;purpleAgent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;EndEpisode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nf"&gt;ResetScene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HitPurpleGoal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// purple wins&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// turn floor purple&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nf"&gt;StartCoroutine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;GoalScoredSwapGroundMaterial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;volleyballSettings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;purpleGoalMaterial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;RenderersList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;5f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// end episode&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;blueAgent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;EndEpisode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;purpleAgent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;EndEpisode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nf"&gt;ResetScene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HitIntoBlueArea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lastHitter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Team&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Purple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="n"&gt;purpleAgent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;AddReward&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="k"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HitIntoPurpleArea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lastHitter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Team&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Blue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="n"&gt;blueAgent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;AddReward&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="k"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now when you click Play ▶️ you should see the environment working correctly: the ball is affected by gravity, the agents can stand on the ground, and the episode resets when the ball hits the floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---ClgM-UP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nrmuc0zfwavbxa7dzj6t.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---ClgM-UP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nrmuc0zfwavbxa7dzj6t.gif" alt="finished-environment.gif" title="Finished environment with physics"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#wrapup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Wrap-up
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should now have a volleyball environment ready for our agents to train in. It will assign our agents rewards to encourage a certain type of behavior (volleying the ball back and forth).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next section, we'll design our agents and give it actions to choose from and a way to observe its environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any feedback or questions, please let me know!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The hidden bias in Core Web Vitals</title>
      <author>Ibrahim Cesar</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 00:56:36 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/ibrahimcesar/the-hidden-bias-in-core-web-vitals-2k64</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google's &lt;strong&gt;Core Web Vitals&lt;/strong&gt; has arrived. And as Google prides itself, has an &lt;a href="https://web.dev/vitals-business-impact/"&gt;huge business impact&lt;/a&gt;. The data is very well known that even small increases in performance, with a faster website your conversion rates grows. But the set, based on the top performers, has hidden bias embedded in it I want to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, more context: the Core Web Vitals are a set of three metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://web.dev/lcp/"&gt;Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)&lt;/a&gt;: measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://web.dev/lcp/"&gt;First Input Delay (FID)&lt;/a&gt;: measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have a FID of 100 milliseconds or less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://web.dev/cls/"&gt;Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)&lt;/a&gt;: measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of 0.1. or less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google does a great deal to &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/about"&gt;share a lot of information&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--G43FiPtj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kvxa8ouv58nq800docv3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--G43FiPtj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kvxa8ouv58nq800docv3.png" alt="The Three Core Web Vitals"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Three Core Web Vitals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I will not argue &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; Web Core Vitals. I think is past due the time we take our user metrics, real user metrics (sometimes called by its acronym, RUM) in the center of everything we do. The "rise of user centric" metrics such as CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) and other are remarkable feats and much needed. But I have some thoughts in the complexity that arise from it. I was lucky enough to attend in person the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1UP7wRCPH8"&gt;2019 Google Chrome Developer Summit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It was the first time I saw presentations calling out developers to not only pay attention to their top devices — several of the talks the subject and reality of low end devices. It was amazing to see that. But I was thinking... "I'm working in Brazil for at least 10 years and all my references came from here, &lt;em&gt;this place&lt;/em&gt;, and now, &lt;strong&gt;2019&lt;/strong&gt;, they are talking about the most common scenario I face &lt;em&gt;everyday&lt;/em&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a material side of web and computing in general&lt;sup id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, that sometimes we think little about. Most of the time, we only take the bits and bytes as part of things. We literally wired together our continents with cables, physical cables, transporting data from one place to another. Even communicating with the computer in the other room takes times. There’s no such thing as instant communication, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/06/fcc-has-serious-doubts-that-spacex-can-deliver-latencies-under-100ms/"&gt;laws of physics continues to apply&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://web.dev/defining-core-web-vitals-thresholds/"&gt;Defining the Core Web Vitals metrics thresholds&lt;/a&gt; that aims to explore the research and methodology behind Core Web Vitals thresholds. Is stated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, we aim to identify a threshold that is consistently achievable at the &lt;strong&gt;75th percentile for top performing sites&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Ookla, a company specializing in internet speed testing, reported that the global average download speed on fixed broadband is 85.73 Mbps as of September 2020. The average mobile download speed is 35.96. As technology becomes more advanced and networks are improved, these numbers are expected to continue to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on data from Ookla, Singapore is the nation with the fastest broadband download speeds of 226.60 Mbps. Hong Kong follows this with 210.73 Mbps and Romania with 193.47 Mbps. The United States has the 10th-fastest internet download speeds of 161.14 Mbps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The countries with the fastest mobile internet speeds are different. The fastest mobile download speeds can be found in South Korea at 121.00 Mbps. China follows with 113.35 Mbps and the United Arab Emirates with 109.43 Mbps.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/internet-speeds-by-country" title="Internet Speeds By Country 2021"&gt;Internet Speeds By Country 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top performing web sites I assume are against the global pool of sites. Mobile speed is not an issue with code itself, but there’s a &lt;strong&gt;material issue&lt;/strong&gt; with this "fair measurement". Because in the Global South we have historically less speed and very low end devices with a minority using top end devices. A site with 1MB payload will load much faster in a 5G connection and in a high end device than in a 3G connection (or sometimes worst as we have here in Brazil and I think I could apply to all great Global South) and low end devices that our audiences use. Using the same data, Brazil has an average of 67.86 in broadband speed and 28.36 in mobile speed. Orders of magnitude lesser than the top velocities. Low end devices also means that we cannot always use the latest improvement in browsers and web apis. We need to use polyfills and other tactics that can hurt even more our overall performance. When Douglas Crockford said that the browser was the most hostile development environment he was talking from some office in Silicon Valley, I wonder what he would say about developing for the wider range of low end devices we have around here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked a representative of Google on the subject. And asked if the realities in connection and devices would be take in account, the answer and I quote, since in the spirit of the &lt;a href="https://publishersonair.withgoogle.com/events/google-latam-search-webinar-portugues-espanol/watch?talk=google-latam-search-webinar-english"&gt;Honest Results Policy employed by Google in search, was in an open session&lt;/a&gt;, and you can check it out, around 1:05:00 was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not aware of anything planned in that direction. Regarding on the website and what your audience makes it a bit easier or harder, but essentiality we want this Core Web Vital be as global as possible. In practice, if your users are in very slow connections then you must make sure your site is extra fast for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SZNREQ5o--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/39wstzufip7adx0m5x7o.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SZNREQ5o--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/39wstzufip7adx0m5x7o.jpeg" alt="Red Queen"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Not only run, but run at least twice as fast! "Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!" — Red Queen from Lewis Carroll's &lt;strong&gt;Through the Looking-Glass&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] We have three areas in Core Web Vital metrics ... one is poor, another needs improvement and good. As soon you reach that middle area with the Core Web Vitals fields data, you will see improvements ...So as long you are in that middle range, you are in a good area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So... is &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; not being &lt;strong&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] The good thing about Core Web Vitals you are competing with sites that are in the same situation as you. If you have the same users you are kinda competing against them is not that you are measuring your site against the fastest of the fastest other sites out there. For the individual queries we see websites that have good web vitals and sites that don’t have good web vitals [...] And, &lt;strong&gt;if none of the sites can reach good Core Web Vitals for specific queries that don’t cause any problems because everyone is on the same level again&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When thinking about the question this was the first thing that I thought because of this I put bold in the sentence. Is reasonable and at surface level looks like resolves the “material question” for good. But not so fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is a sort of “Invisible Hand” argument. The sites competing for the queries are not born the same. Some have niche audiences (maybe with better connection speeds because is a niche of user with more money and inequality only goes up in South America), some are ultra bare bones blogs created to spread misinformation and “fake news” and therefore will score higher than an outlet that has subscribers, has more content to show, produces graphics and all the things provide better and more contextualized news but has to pay the “tax” to try a broad audience in a reality of several low end devices and poor connections. Is an optimistic and “best-case scenario” answer. Is something that everybody on the internet knows on some level: you are not competing with “your peers”, you are competing with everyone else for individual queries and there’s a whole sort of plurality in the actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think since they operate with a closer look on the top performers they are not paying enough attention on how these "fair" set of metrics are biased, one-sided and might have several side-effects since it has such an impact on business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3DHfp04"&gt;Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism&lt;/a&gt;,  Safiya Umoja Noble challenges the idea that search engines like Google offer an equal playing field for all forms of ideas, identities, and activities. Data discrimination is a real social problem; Noble argues that the combination of private interests in promoting certain sites, along with the monopoly status of a relatively small number of Internet search engines, leads to a biased set of search algorithms that privilege whiteness and discriminate against people of color, specifically women of color. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big Tech always use algorithm as a shield, in order to avoid further scrutiny, and as a means to excuse bad outcomes or deny agency. But as the researcher does, the politics and assumptions about the world are embedded in the tools and even in "fair" metrics that cannot accurately describe and measure with the promised “fairness” from math and algorithm — which besides codes, in the end mean “our choices”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google wants to &lt;strong&gt;"No site gets preferential treatment"&lt;/strong&gt;. And I believe in them. I do. I don't think there's any Evil Room where some "White Guy 10x Developer" is making the decisions, but as all escalations must use public channels, I'm here, trying to push and shine some light in these particular specifics since the structural biases are by definition invisible because they are part of society and world views, and I and hope to open a more diverse conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
