      <description>&lt;p&gt;DEV is a community of software developers getting together to help one another out. The software industry relies on collaboration and networked learning. They provide a place for that to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once relegated to the browser as one of the 3 core technologies of the web, JavaScript can now be found almost anywhere you find code.&lt;br&gt;
JavaScript developers move fast and push software development forward; they can be as opinionated as the frameworks they use, so let's keep it clean here and make it a place to learn from each other!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JavaScript Let - How to declare block-scoped values?</title>
      <author>hrishikesh1990</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 11:32:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/hrishikesh1990/javascript-let-how-to-declare-block-scoped-values-2inc</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/hrishikesh1990/javascript-let-how-to-declare-block-scoped-values-2inc</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this short tutorial, we look at how to declare block-scoped values using JavaScript let. We also look at how the let keyword is different from the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tutorial is a part of our initiative at &lt;a href="https://flexiple.com/"&gt;Flexiple&lt;/a&gt;, to write short curated tutorials around often used or interesting concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#table-of-contents-javascript-startswith"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Table of Contents - JavaScript startsWith():
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#javascript-let"&gt;JavaScript let&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#code-and-explanation"&gt;Code and Explanation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#redeclaring-variables"&gt;Redeclaring variables&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#closing-thoughts"&gt;Closing thoughts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#javascript-let"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  JavaScript let:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until ES5, JavaScript variables had either global or local scope. Only after ES6 was block scope introduced in JavaScript. Scope denotes which variables we have access to in our program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have come across functional scope variables, these variables are only accessible inside a function. You could receive an error in case you tried to print it outside the function. Apart from these, there are global variables. These variables can be accessed anywhere in the program and are declared using the var keyword.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, variables that are block-scoped are only accessible inside a particular block of code. These variables are declared using JavaScript let and these blocks are enclosed within { } brackets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#code-and-explanation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Code and Explanation:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us look at a code snippet explaining the same.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Output: 1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Output: 2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Output: 1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the code snippet, we initially declared a variable ‘num’ using the var keyword. We printed the value and the output was 1&lt;br&gt;
We printed the value and the output was 1&lt;br&gt;
We later open a block and use the let keyword to declare the value as 2. Now the value of ‘num’ inside the block is 2&lt;br&gt;
Lastly, we print the variable after the block is closed, here the variable takes the values set using the var keyword&lt;br&gt;
The above steps are an example of how the let method can be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#redeclaring-variables"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Redeclaring variables:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While using the JavaScript let, the variable cannot be redeclared within the same block. Attempting to do so would raise an error as shown below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Error: Identifier 'num' has already been declared&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is a common problem while using a switch case, this can be solved by using new blocks for each case. However, this is not a problem while using the var keyword. The below code snippet should give an idea of the case:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As aforementioned, a similar syntax can be used while using the let method in switch cases as the variable has to be redeclared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#closing-thoughts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Closing thoughts:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, although we discuss in detail about the JavaScript let methods we have not explained in detail about scope. I would recommend you spend some quality reading about the various types of scopes and their uses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lambda Expressions in Java</title>
      <author>Nitish-op</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 11:13:47 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/nitish_op/lambda-expressions-in-java-2687</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/nitish_op/lambda-expressions-in-java-2687</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lambda expressions are similar to methods, but they are anonymous methods (methods without names) used to implement a method defined by a functional interface and they can be implemented right in the body of a method. A lambda expression is a short block of code which takes in parameters and returns a value so they implement the only abstract function and therefore implement functional interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#syntax"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Syntax
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(parameters) -&amp;gt; { code block }&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The left side specifies the parameters required by the expression, which could also be empty if no parameters are required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The right side is the lambda body which specifies the actions of the lambda expression. The body of a lambda expression can contain zero, one or more statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When there is a single statement curly brackets are not mandatory and the return type of the anonymous function is the same as that of the body expression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When there are more than one statements, then these must be enclosed in curly brackets (a code block) and the return type of the anonymous function is the same as the type of the value returned within the code block, or void if nothing is returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#using-lambda-expressions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Using Lambda Expressions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.Example: No Parameter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;interface Trigger{&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    public String display();&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
public class LambdaExpressionExample3{&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
public static void main(String[] args) {&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    Trigger s=()-&amp;gt;{ return "Lambda function is used";};&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    System.out.println(s.display());&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.Example: Single Parameter(can also be with multiple parameter)&lt;br&gt;
interface NumericTest {&lt;br&gt;
    boolean computeTest(int n); &lt;br&gt;
}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;public static void main(String args[]) {&lt;br&gt;
    NumericTest Even = (n) -&amp;gt; (n % 2) == 0;&lt;br&gt;
    NumericTest Negative = (n) -&amp;gt; (n &amp;lt; 0); &lt;br&gt;
        System.out.println(Even.computeTest(10));&lt;br&gt;
        System.out.println(Negative.computeTest(-9));&lt;br&gt;
}&lt;br&gt;
3.Lambda expressions as arguments&lt;br&gt;
interface MyString {&lt;br&gt;
    String myStringFunction(String str);&lt;br&gt;
}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;public static String reverseofStr(MyString reverse, String str){&lt;br&gt;
  return reverse.myStringFunction(str);&lt;br&gt;
}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;public static void main (String args[]) {&lt;br&gt;
    // lambda to reverse string&lt;br&gt;
    MyString reverse = (str) -&amp;gt; {&lt;br&gt;
        String result = ""; &lt;br&gt;
        for(int i = str.length()-1; i &amp;gt;= 0; i--)&lt;br&gt;
            result += str.charAt(i);&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        return result;&lt;br&gt;
    };&lt;br&gt;
    System.out.println(reverseofStr(reverse, "Lambda example")); &lt;br&gt;
}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;lambda expressions are added in Java 8 to provide functionalities such as&lt;br&gt;
Enable to treat functionality as a method argument, or code as data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A function that can be created without belonging to any class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lambda expression can be passed around as if it was an object and executed on demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so it saves a lot of code. In case of lambda expression, we don't need to define the method again for providing the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Create nice Readmes for your open source projects ✨</title>
      <author>Avneesh Agarwal</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 11:10:31 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/byteslash/create-nice-readmes-for-your-open-source-projects-3c8m</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/byteslash/create-nice-readmes-for-your-open-source-projects-3c8m</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Creating good Readmes for your open source project is very important to get some popularity, stars, forks, and contributors. So today we are going to look at 2 ways to create beautiful Readmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-readmemdgenerator"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://github.com/kefranabg/readme-md-generator"&gt;1. Readme-md-generator&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This CLI tool generates a great looking in a few minutes. To use this tool run-&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx readme-md-generator
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After running this command, it will ask you a bunch of questions for adding in the readme. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DunJRuVs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634631785207/xTIl0Tdl6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DunJRuVs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634631785207/xTIl0Tdl6.png" alt="image.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After you have answered all the questions it will create a README.md file for you that looks like this-&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag_gist-liquid-tag"&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now you can edit and tweak it as per your need. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#quick-hack"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Quick hack
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to preview the readme directly hit ctrl + shift + V and it will show you a live preview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--W3c31kt2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634631985171/kyEEEGF87.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--W3c31kt2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634631985171/kyEEEGF87.png" alt="image.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-readmeso"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2.  &lt;a href="https://readme.so/"&gt;Readme.so&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to build a more customized Readme, then this is a great tool built by @&lt;a href="https://dev.to@katherinecodes"&gt;Katherine Peterson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Fsaw9ZOC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634632855581/5CoDKpy2B.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Fsaw9ZOC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634632855581/5CoDKpy2B.png" alt="image.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By just clicking some buttons and editing some text, I got a nice readme like this-&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag_gist-liquid-tag"&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I hope you could make some nice Readmes for your open source projects with these amazing tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What tools do you use for making your Readme? Let me know in the comments 👇&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Useful links-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/kefranabg/readme-md-generator"&gt;Readme MD generator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://readme.so/"&gt;Readme.so&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://avneesh-links.vercel.app/"&gt;All socials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi, I’m Andrew McIntosh. I’m a software engineer at FreshBooks. I’ve moved around development teams a couple of times, but right now I’m working on our API and Integrations team, trying to make things better for developers looking to build API integrations. If that’s you, or you want that to be you, here are five bits of advice on how you can build an (or build a better) API integration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get To Know The API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Libraries, Tools, and SDKs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit The Scope of Requests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Properly Handle Errors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do More Asynchronous Work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#get-to-know-the-api"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Get To Know The API
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might seem obvious, &lt;strong&gt;but read the docs of whatever API you’re working with&lt;/strong&gt;. This is really the starting point on figuring out how you can do the thing you want to do. Reading through, you might even find a better way to do something than you initially thought. A good API is intuitive and predictable, but even good APIs can have odd, unexpected behaviour in places. Look at examples too as they can really help in cases where the documentation is dated or sparse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping API documentation up to date is not always easy, so if you find some place where it’s wrong, someone will be very happy if you report it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#use-libraries-tools-and-sdks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Use Libraries, Tools, and SDKs
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A company with an API wants it to be used, so often they invest time and effort into making things that will make your life using it easier (like this!). &lt;strong&gt;Take advantage of the work they did for you and consider using libraries or SDKs they’ve provided&lt;/strong&gt;. If a company doesn’t have an SDK, or if what they have doesn’t fit your language or framework of choice, take a look for a 3rd-party solution (often API docs will list a bunch of these in addition to company-build ones).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using an SDK or library isn’t generally required, but there are advantages to not having to reinvent the wheel. Many of the topics I’m going to cover next might already be handled by a well-built SDK! Often SDK developers know the API quite well (especially if they’re employees of the company) and they can often simplify, clarify, or even paper over those oddities or inconsistencies I mentioned in documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, for historical reasons a lot of the oldest accounting endpoints in FreshBooks’ API return dates in North American Eastern Time (US/Eastern aka EST/EDT, time zones are complicated), while all newer endpoints to return dates in UTC (we’re moving everything to UTC, but it takes time). If you’re using one of our SDKs, we hide that from you and return all the dates in UTC. We’ve done the work so YOU don’t have to figure out which is which!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like documentation, if you find a bug or missing feature in a tool, the owner would love your feedback, and if it’s open source and you’re keen, you could even try to fix it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#limit-the-scope-of-requests"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Limit The Scope of Requests
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For your own benefit, as well as the API owner’s you want to &lt;strong&gt;fetch data in an efficient way&lt;/strong&gt;. This means not grabbing data that you don’t care about and will just throw away, as well as not fetching too much data at once and then having memory or performance issues trying to process it that can spill over into slow responsiveness for your users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that you should look at how an API handles filters (to limit returned records to only those you care about), pagination (fetch records in smaller batches so you can handle them in chunks), sorting (so those batches come in an order that works for you), and maybe even what fields are included in the response (so the record itself isn’t filled with data you don’t need). Here is FreshBooks’ &lt;a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/api/parameters"&gt;Search, Paging and Includes documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, one integration I was debugging checked to see if the client to sync invoices to existed before creating it:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;matchingClients&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;freshbooksClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;clients&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;accountId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;matchingClient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;matchingClients&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;clients&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;currClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;organization&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;clientOrganization&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But it was sometimes creating duplicate clients. This was because FreshBooks defaults to returning 30 records at a time with the newest ones first. This worked fine when it first created the client, but as customers used the app and made more clients, the client to sync with got bumped off of the first 30 results and was no longer found. In addition to that, the code was fetching as many clients as it could, and then filtered them in memory. It either needed a filter or pagination (or both).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;clientSearchQueryBuilder&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;SearchQueryBuilder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;like&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Organization_like&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;clientOrganization&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;matchingClients&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;freshBooksApi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;clients&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fbAccountId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;searchQueryBuilder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;matchingClients&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;clients&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;matchingClient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;matchingClients&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let the API do that work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#properly-handle-errors"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Properly Handle Errors
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot to proper error handling, so let's look at things in pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#api-errors"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  API Errors
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of API docs will have information on error codes, states, messages. You don’t want your integration to break unexpectedly, so you should look to handle these. Logging response messages is really helpful when building an application to understand business rules or validation failures. When you’re up and running in production, it’s equally important to help you know why something might be failing. For example, a good API won’t just give you a &lt;code&gt;422 Unprocessable Entity&lt;/code&gt;, but might return a message like &lt;code&gt;422 - At least one field among first_name, last_name, email or organization is required&lt;/code&gt; (a &lt;a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/api/clients"&gt;FreshBooks client&lt;/a&gt; validation error message)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The API isn’t your code, and you don’t control what comes out. This is a black box, and it’s helpful to follow defensive coding practices.&lt;/strong&gt; You should check http response codes, wrap your calls in try/catches, etc.. Don’t assume that a response you get has an object or resource data structure as a failure may return an error data structure instead, so you should be prepared to parse or otherwise handle either. If a REST APIs backend service is down, a company’s API gateway might not even return you JSON but instead give you an HTML error page that your JSON-expecting code will just fail to parse. In short, don’t assume that the response will always come in the form you expect, and ensure you handle cases when it doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#timeouts-and-connection-exceptions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Timeouts and Connection Exceptions
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The API you're using isn’t perfect. It could be slow or offline. In these cases, your integration could run into issues if all the processors or workers are stuck waiting on the API. &lt;strong&gt;For this reason, you should configure timeouts on your calls.&lt;/strong&gt; HTTP clients have easily set timeouts but often they are not enabled by default. Again, a good SDK will have some sane defaults for you (we &lt;a href="https://github.com/freshbooks/freshbooks-python-sdk/blob/release/0.8.0/freshbooks/client.py#L51"&gt;default to 30 seconds but let you easily override&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general there are connect timeouts (how long you wait to establish a connection), and read timeouts (how long you wait for the response). Some clients let you set them together or individually, but you’ll want to set both to protect from an unresponsive server (connect), or a really slow response (read). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figuring out exactly what the timeout values should be is very dependent on your integration and the API you’re using, but even setting them to something high (15-30 seconds) can save you a lot of pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#rate-limits"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Rate Limits
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most APIs will limit traffic to prevent a bad actor from hindering other integration’s performance or degrading the entire system. You should build your integration to respect and accommodate these limits. Running up against them constantly doesn’t do you any good, as your work won’t get done faster, and could result in your integration being banned. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, it’s best to build your integration with efficient calls in mind. Reducing the number of calls you need to make means you’re less likely to hit call limits. &lt;br&gt;
Another good practice is to properly handle rate limit errors (generally HTTP 429 errors), and then rather than retry right away, wait for a bit before making the next call. If the next call is still limited, wait even longer. This is called an exponential backoff, and again, most HTTP libraries will have a way to enable this and many SDKs will have implemented this (our SDKs do it &lt;a href="https://github.com/freshbooks/freshbooks-python-sdk/blob/release/0.8.0/freshbooks/api/resource.py#L34-L42"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/freshbooks/freshbooks-nodejs-sdk/blob/%40freshbooks/api%402.0.1/packages/api/src/APIClient.ts#L115-L119"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#do-more-asynchronous-work"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Do More Asynchronous Work
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your integration is handling a lot of data via an API, you should consider &lt;strong&gt;moving as much work to asynchronous tasks as possible&lt;/strong&gt;. In this way you can not block your users, manage and throttle your work loads, and easily retry failures. The above advice on handling rate limits gets a lot easier if your processing code isn’t blocking user actions while retrying. It also lets you throttle the calls in whatever queue system you’re using. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look into &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/"&gt;Amazon’s SQS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/creating-queues"&gt;Google’s Cloud Tasks queues&lt;/a&gt;, Python’s &lt;a href="https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/getting-started/introduction.html"&gt;celery&lt;/a&gt; and something like &lt;a href="https://www.cloudamqp.com/"&gt;CloudAMQP&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull"&gt;Bull&lt;/a&gt; with Redis. There are a lot of options out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another good idea is to use webhooks if the API supports them (&lt;a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/api/webhooks"&gt;FreshBooks does&lt;/a&gt;). This allows you to register to receive messages when an event happens. Rather than polling an API every 5 minutes to see if a new resource has been created, you can tell the API to send you a message when that happens. This can save you a lot of calls and overhead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going back to that old integration I was debugging. It would sync invoices with FreshBooks every 20 minutes, but the process involved gathering up all the invoices it hadn’t pushed and looping through them. However the process was driven by a synchronous HTTP call that would timeout after just a couple minutes, killing the process. It could take days to move everything over. Calling the process more often would only help a little as there were only so many calls the service could handle at one time and these long-running calls could block workers from handling user interaction with the app. We redesigned the whole sync process of the integration so that everything was done in small asynchronous tasks. On first signup we had an async task that would fetch each invoice (paginated), and put a message on the queue to process that invoice. The invoice processing tasks could thus be retried, scaled up, or throttled as needed. We also utilized webhooks for real-time updates. Each event received would just create another invoice process task. Instead of days, things could be processed in seconds, minutes, or perhaps hours for very large workloads. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#go-out-and-build"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Go Out And Build
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I hope that gives you a few ideas on building a robust integration. If you know the API you’re using and the tools available, keep your calls efficient, handle the unexpected gracefully, and keep your time consuming processing away from the user’s actions, you’re on a great path to succeed. If you have any questions, please reach out to me, and if you have anything related to FreshBooks’ API you can email &lt;a href="mailto:newapi@freshbooks.com"&gt;newapi@freshbooks.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In today's virtual world, people are becoming more and more accustomed to experiencing things virtually. In the era of artificial intelligence and AI, how can healthcare be far behind?&lt;br&gt;
Virtual healthcare, which uses technology to create virtual interactions between patients and doctors, has gained a lot of traction in recent years. It is helping patients connect to doctors from the comfort of their homes without physically visiting them while offering them a healthcare experience as close to real as it gets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Healthcare apps have been on the rise. According to Statista, the global healthcare app market is expected to reach $582 billion by 2023, and healthcare apps will be downloaded close to 2 billion times by 2022. These apps allow patients to book appointments, consult with doctors, get prescriptions, and even order medicines. The rise of virtual healthcare has drastically changed how the healthcare industry operates. It is helping patients connect with doctors from the comfort of their homes without physically visiting them while offering them a healthcare experience as close to real as it gets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Doctor Appointment App Development:-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The doctor's appointment booking app is helpful as it saves you from the hassle of having to visit a doctor's office, parking your car, waiting in a queue, and paying hefty charges. All you need to do is download the app, fill in your details, and select the day, time and doctor. All you have to pay is nominal charges. The best thing about the app is that you can choose from different types of doctors – regular, pediatric, emergency, and specialist. Moreover, you can pick the doctor at your convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtual healthcare, which uses technology to create virtual interactions between patients and doctors, has gained a lot of traction in recent years. It is helping patients connect to doctors from the comfort of their homes without physically visiting them while offering them a healthcare experience as close to real as it gets. Healthcare apps have been on the rise. These apps allow patients to book appointments, consult with doctors, get prescriptions, and even order medicines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction to Telemedicine:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtual medical care, telemedicine, e-medicine, and telehealth are terms referring to electronic health care technology. In general, the term telehealth refers to telecommunications technologies to deliver health care services at a distance via interactive audio and video transmissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telemedicine uses telecommunications technologies to deliver health care services at a distance via interactive audio and video transmissions. Telemedicine combines traditional health care practices with telecommunications technologies. Health care providers transmit health and medical data through the telephone, radio, Internet, or satellite connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtual care is the delivery of health care services via electronic means. Virtual care refers to the delivery of health care through telecommunications technologies but does not include delivering health care services via interactive audio and video transmissions. Virtual care may include online checkups, online consultations, online prescriptions, online physician visits, virtual clinics, online health advice, and so on. Doctors and patients also communicate with each other through emails, text messages, online chats, video conferences, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telehealth improves access to health care services and reduces the geographic barriers that limit individual health care. Telehealth not only increases the number of health care providers but also improves the health care quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telehealth education can improve the health and well-being of people around the world. Some telehealth education programs include online tutorials, online training, online lectures, distance learning, online seminars, online classes, etc. Telehealth education is the future of medical education.&lt;br&gt;
Telehealth also helps in distance learning. Distance learning is the traditional method of teaching in which the teacher is teaching students who are not physically present in class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Are Virtual Visits the Need of the Hour?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the COVID 19 outbreak, however, many medical practitioners have set up virtual clinics where patients can see a doctor over the Internet. That approach may make sense for common problems like colds or the flu, where the doctor can usually tell the patient what to do and send them home. But the virtual clinic approach is inappropriate for more serious conditions like heart disease, cancer, or stroke. In those cases, the doctor has to be sure of the diagnosis, and the most common way of doing that is by seeing the patient face to face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtual clinics are still useful in some situations. When you have an extremely rare disease, for example, a virtual clinic may be the only way you can find a doctor who treats it. But for most conditions, going online is unlikely to provide enough additional information to allow the doctor to diagnose and prescribe the proper treatment. When a patient is admitted to a hospital, his doctor arrives and takes him for a physical. The doctor examines him, takes his pulse, listens to his heart, and then prescribes treatment. The patient encounters a nurse who takes his temperature, listens to his breathing, and swabbing his nose on the way out. The patient then goes to a pharmacy, where a technician, who usually is not a doctor, takes his blood pressure. After processing, the patient gets a prescription for medicine and leaves. Moreover, the patient's medical records are reviewed by a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, suppose that telemedicine is gradually replacing face-to-face consultations. The doctors will ask questions to their patients on their Smartphone. The doctor will prescribe medicine, and the patient will get the medicine delivered to his home. The doctor's staff can do this review. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patients Get Special Attention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most doctors are convinced that they have two patients: the ones they see and the ones they don't. They spend almost all of their time with the one they see; the other waits impatiently on the front porch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But doctors' waiting rooms are too small. Half the time, the patients sitting on the couch don't even look at the doctor. Meanwhile, the patients have a lot to tell them. Instead of being intimidated and intimidated, they'd rather talk to their doctor. Doctors who learn how to listen can cure more diseases. The problem is that doctors don't know how to listen. If you want to learn how to listen, it helps to know what to listen for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.idea2app.dev/medicine-delivery-app-development.html"&gt;Appointment App Development&lt;/a&gt;:-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could argue that it makes no difference: video appointments are still appointments, so the patient can reschedule or cancel them or just not show up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But suppose the patient has trouble cancelling. Suppose the patient has trouble showing up. Suppose the patient has trouble understanding what the doctor is saying. Suppose the patient has trouble getting an appointment. When a medical consultation becomes dependent on technology, the patient loses control. Without control, the patient loses information. Without information, the patient loses power. Even the best system will be less good for the patient than a real appointment, which is already better than no appointment. It's the difference between a doctor making a recommendation and a patient weighing the pros and cons of treatment. Virtual medical consultations reduce the doctor-patient relationship to a transactional one: the doctor reviews the information you have provided and recommends the best treatment for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most consultants have a website, and, if you are lucky, you'll find reviews left by other people. But these are not reliable: ordinary customers do not have much to say about the consultants they consult, and consultants are not always eager to advertise their failings. So, for example, if you look up "Dr. Bernard" on Psychology Today, you get 133 pages of notes about his prescriptions but no mention of his rudeness. A better place to look for reviews is Yelp. There are almost 120 reviews of Dr Bernard, and they are all quite bad. The doctor is rude, practices medicine without qualifications, swears, and is worst of all, he is French.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Yelp's reviews are neither reliable nor complete. Because Yelp is a website, it only asks its users to review doctors they have worked with. This is helpful because if every user left a review for every doctor they had ever visited, Yelp would become unusable. But it is quite misleading: if a user is unhappy, they may never contact the doctor again, and Yelp never gets to hear about that. Worse, reviewers on Yelp can lie. Yelp cannot tell if a review is genuine or even whether two different reviewers are the same person. Reviews can be even more misleading than they seem. For example, Yelp has a button that allows reviewers to report fake reviews, but it does not tell whether the report is genuine. So a reviewer can report a fake review, and Yelp can punish the faker, but Yelp can never tell whether the faker was telling the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.idea2app.dev/medicine-delivery-app-development.html"&gt;Doctor appointment app development&lt;/a&gt;:- &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A doctor's app, which patients and doctors own, is gaining traction. It's a disruptive technology. But in terms of revenue, it's still a small market.  The health care industry, which accounts for 17 per cent of the U.S. economy, generated $3.9 trillion in 2015. And of that, $1.6 trillion was spent on pharmaceuticals. The app lets patients and providers instantly set up video consultations or transfer video from Skype, Google Hangouts or Face time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have any allergies or would like to seek medical advice on a general matter? Are you afraid of going out during Corona virus season? There is no need to be concerned because telemedicine platforms will keep you covered and remotely provide doctor coverage for all illnesses. All you have to do is schedule an appointment with a doctor and show up at the scheduled time. This way, you can live a healthy life and avoid becoming exposed to any virus infections that are circulating.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/tanmayvaish/13-reasons-why-you-should-use-linux-3p6i</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;People usually think: "If it so easy to run Windows, Why should I use Linux". Honestly writing, they are pretty much right about it too. There are lots and lots of features which Linux will always have a hard time providing to its users. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to reliability and solidity, Everyone knows that Linux is the one-stop solution, let it be &lt;strong&gt;servers running the internet or for storage of our cloud data&lt;/strong&gt;. Even, Microsoft uses Linux to run &lt;a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/"&gt;Azure&lt;/a&gt; (Yeah, It does!!😱). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its open source nature also plays a vital part on its awesomeness🌟. Think, if all the &lt;strong&gt;greatest mind in this whole world participate to create a product&lt;/strong&gt;, Will anything else could compete to that? The answer is straight away NO. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That's what Linux is...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No specific hardware requirement or anything. Just download it and use and customize it however you please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I am going to list down &lt;strong&gt;13 points&lt;/strong&gt; which leave you &lt;strong&gt;mesmerized&lt;/strong&gt;, making you eager to switch your Operating System right now!! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-free-and-open-source"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Free and Open Source 😋
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---Fo3s2Ka--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633923806557/gcCPFVeWn.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---Fo3s2Ka--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633923806557/gcCPFVeWn.jpeg" alt="free.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linux&lt;/strong&gt; does not cost you a penny (&lt;em&gt;other than your data charges during its installation&lt;/em&gt; ✨). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking about Windows, it will roughly cost you from around $140 to $200 at best buy. While for MacOS, You have exclusively buy a iMac or Macbook which are &lt;strong&gt;not cheap&lt;/strong&gt; (I must add). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Linux, after the download, it is &lt;strong&gt;ALL YOURS&lt;/strong&gt;. No more hidden charges, add-on packs or anything. Interestingly, with its &lt;strong&gt;open source nature&lt;/strong&gt;, you can view the source code 😱, giving you the freedom to add, remove or modify whatever features you want (&lt;em&gt;according to your technical skills&lt;/em&gt; 🤓). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many Companies and Programmers &lt;strong&gt;create their versions of Linux&lt;/strong&gt; to get the best benefits for their work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-easy-to-use"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Easy to Use 🥮
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3l6qKs3L--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633922905715/IBnXPXSwy.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3l6qKs3L--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633922905715/IBnXPXSwy.png" alt="applications.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Is this guys gone mad!!" - you must be thinking, but &lt;strong&gt;NO&lt;/strong&gt;!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trust me&lt;/strong&gt;, It is &lt;strong&gt;very easy to use and comprehend&lt;/strong&gt;. Its just that, people tend to get swayed by the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution"&gt;distros&lt;/a&gt; currently trending, which are generally hard to use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operating Systems like &lt;a href="https://archlinux.org/"&gt;Arch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.gentoo.org/"&gt;Gentoo&lt;/a&gt; are such distros which are not only &lt;strong&gt;hard to use&lt;/strong&gt; but also &lt;strong&gt;hard to install&lt;/strong&gt;. Start with &lt;strong&gt;less complicated&lt;/strong&gt; distros like &lt;a href="https://ubuntu.com/"&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://getsol.us/home/"&gt;Solus&lt;/a&gt; etc. They provide easy &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface"&gt;GUI&lt;/a&gt; (Graphical User Interfaces) for installation and Software management. Moreover, use &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager"&gt;Window Managers&lt;/a&gt;/ &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment"&gt;Desktop Environment&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href="https://forty.gnome.org/"&gt;Gnome 40&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://ubuntubudgie.org/"&gt;Budgie&lt;/a&gt;, they provide great GUIs for your Linux which makes your overall experience very easy and efficient🥳. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, after sometime on Linux, you will start to admire &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface"&gt;CLI&lt;/a&gt;(Command Line Interface). Why? 'cause it just makes your work very fast. &lt;code&gt;Type one command&lt;/code&gt; and its done🤩. Isn't it cool🔥?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-multiplicity"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Multiplicity 👏
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bjdtiMsx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633926533303/BJTEJ868d.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bjdtiMsx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633926533303/BJTEJ868d.jpeg" alt="multiple.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://devrant.com/rants/59847/what-linux-distro-are-you-using"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever heard of the term &lt;code&gt;Distro-Hopping&lt;/code&gt;⁉️? It is actually a activity or hobby of enthusiastic Linux users where they frequently switch between different distros. Can you Imagine? There are so many distros, that it has become a sport to switch between🤩. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Never getting bored again!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no end to the versions and variety of Linux. There is a particular Linux for every possible task, specializing in providing configuration, packages and customization to ease your work of setting up again and again🤩. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let it be Programming, Hacking , DevOps or if you have a low-end desktop, Linux have got you covered. You can even make one for your own and publish it for anyone from your field to use. &lt;em&gt;Isn't it amazing?&lt;/em&gt;🔥. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-cyber-security"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Cyber Security 🕵️‍♂️
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--e5FJyNHZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633920357162/g-XIHEiN1.webp" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--e5FJyNHZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633920357162/g-XIHEiN1.webp" alt="hackerman.webp"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no way in heaven 🌌, that you can start your journey to become a cyber security expert/hacker without knowing 'L' of "Linux". The security and transparency of Linux provides just makes it ideal for the hacking purposes😯. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good hacker knows their operating system perfectly, and even more importantly, the operating system they will be attacking. Linux allows the user to see and manipulate all of its components, thus the reason for its popularity🔥 among the cyber security experts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linux Distros like &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/"&gt;Kali&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.parrotsec.org/"&gt;Parrot&lt;/a&gt; etc. provide great deal of pre-configured software system and scripts needed to practice or perform a hack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-cloud-and-web-servers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Cloud and Web Servers ☁️
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qjRbD0wE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633925938605/s_-UFUcPI.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qjRbD0wE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633925938605/s_-UFUcPI.jpeg" alt="server.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server"&gt;Web Servers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing"&gt;Cloud&lt;/a&gt; platforms out there are running on Linux💡. With its reliability, organizations can deliver apps, content, and services to their customers &lt;strong&gt;at a low cost but at the same time provide performance, stability, security and it is scalable&lt;/strong&gt;🙀. And don't forget what I previously mentioned, Even Microsoft uses it for its Azure cloud infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 96.3% of the world’s top million servers run on Linux (cloud providers, web hosting, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/09/microsoft-using-linux-run-cloud/"&gt;https://www.wired.com/2015/09/microsoft-using-linux-run-cloud/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, Linux &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell"&gt;shell&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;offers interface&lt;/strong&gt; that let you make decisions, execute commands repeatedly, create new utilities and tools, and automate server administration tasks💡. Basically, giving you &lt;strong&gt;absolute command over your server&lt;/strong&gt;🔥.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-devops"&gt;

  6. DevOps
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DpBmUnyW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633925117402/itSHdzN8a.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DpBmUnyW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633925117402/itSHdzN8a.png" alt="devsops.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;                                    The DevOps workflow. Source: Pease, 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*To understand the role of Linux in DevOps, we first have to understand what is Devops!&lt;/em&gt;🤔&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-devops"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is DevOps?
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps"&gt;DevOps&lt;/a&gt; methodology is an approach that unifies software development with IT operations. The plan emphasizes fast software delivery through automation, integration, close collaboration, and open communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, that we know, lets talk about how Linux and DevOps go hand in hand🤝.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scalability ✔️&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scalability is the key🔑 to DevOps Flow-cycle, Thanks to Linux, you can store and compute any number of processes, and also can run it on anything and anywhere 🔥.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Software Delivery Pipelines ✔️&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery"&gt;software delivery pipelines&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;strong&gt;deployed on Linux servers&lt;/strong&gt;. Thus, It becomes very easy to &lt;strong&gt;run tests&lt;/strong&gt; on your system before deploying it to the servers🔥.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*There are many more example but I am going to omit them as those points are pretty much repetitive of what I said before in this article.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#7-customizable"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  7. Customizable 👨‍🔧
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--w3UP0FRN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633926288258/maEiPn4IA.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--w3UP0FRN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633926288258/maEiPn4IA.jpeg" alt="custom.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sarveshspatil111/i3wm-nord"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the necessary &lt;strong&gt;Imagination and Technical skills🤓&lt;/strong&gt;, you can customize your Linux OS to its fullest capabilities both in a visual and configuration-wise manner😮. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following are some ways you can customize your Linux: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twitching with its Desktop Utilities like File Manager, Window Manager etc.✔️&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installing new Desktop Themes.✔️&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuring Better Shells for your &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface"&gt;CLI&lt;/a&gt; like fish.✔️&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installing new Icons and Fonts.✔️&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exploring new Package Managers.✔️&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing Scripts to automate your work.✔️&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also several tools which helps you customize you system for you. Like, you can use &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_monitor"&gt;System Monitoring Tools&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href="https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky"&gt;Conky&lt;/a&gt; to monitor all your hardware and tasks from your desktop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#8-awesome-community-support"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  8. Awesome Community Support 🤝
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TqN9FLik--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633925659615/f87fwDN3Y.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TqN9FLik--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633925659615/f87fwDN3Y.png" alt="Screenshot from 2021-10-11 09-43-18.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to its reliability and awesomeness, Linux, over the years, has accumulated popularity🔥 among a vast amount of people. The passion and curiosity led them to create many communities, forums, subreddits etc.💡 which are really welcoming and helpful to new comers. You can ask any questions there⁉️, Like having trouble to install anything or issue setting up your new Window Manager, the community will respond to it very fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, There are not few in numbers either, there is at least one dedicated community for every Linux OS out there🤩. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you believe? You are getting super awesome support system without even spending a penny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Once familiar with Linux, you can also contribute in these communities by resolving other user's queries posted over at the forums.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#9-independence"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  9. Independence 💁‍♂️
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q6tHAeBc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633926659319/-R1KXjzPq.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q6tHAeBc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633926659319/-R1KXjzPq.png" alt="IVFpQbV.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://imgur.com/t/linux/l0RGEic"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linux is a Open Source software with no proprietor of any sort💡, which gives you the freedom to &lt;strong&gt;own your OS&lt;/strong&gt;, using it however you want with no questions asked🔥. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, you will be having &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser"&gt;root&lt;/a&gt; access from the start💡! It just &lt;code&gt;gives you more privacy&lt;/code&gt;🔐 as nobody is there to keep check what you are doing with your PC.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can exclusively create Users and set what permissions you want to give it to them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#10-secure"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  10. Secure  👮
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--87gudrmJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633926043323/HXVckOM2h.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--87gudrmJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633926043323/HXVckOM2h.png" alt="secure.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmemes/comments/b9iqua/antivirus/"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linux's &lt;strong&gt;Superior User Privilege Model&lt;/strong&gt; and  &lt;strong&gt;Built-in Kernel Defense System&lt;/strong&gt; just  makes it less vulnerable to any viruses or malware, than any proprietor OS like Windows and Mac💡. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to run any command or file which can change system configuration, you have to be logged in as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser"&gt;root&lt;/a&gt;💡. Malicious programs and viruses require root privileges to make any change or damage to the Linux system, which they don't get, rendering them invalid🤭.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux also saves your precious money which you would have spent on the purchase of expensive anti-virus software to keep your system virus-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, due to it being open source, &lt;strong&gt;all the source code gets reviewed and any vulnerabilities if found gets patched immediately&lt;/strong&gt;💡.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#11-hardware-compatibility"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  11. Hardware Compatibility ⚙️
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TH1_noY2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633926816382/L2pvqoCJi.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TH1_noY2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633926816382/L2pvqoCJi.png" alt="hardware.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmemes/comments/csv6ex/give_an_old_pc_new_life_with_linux/"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Linux can run on just about anything!! From a super small raspberry pi to a huge super computer&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Linux's customization flexibility🌟, it can easily condensed down into small OS package which can cater the need of Low-End Systems. In fact, Linux Community is very famous for its miracles in the revival of outdated yet working hardware systems✨.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you just started college and possibly don't have the budget to buy a high-end laptop. You can consider buying a Low-End one and installing Linux to get the same user experience at a lesser price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusively, If you do not have a High-End PC configuration, and you still want a wonderful experience. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linux will be the best choice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;🔥. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#12-less-bloatware"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  12. Less Bloatware 🤏
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UVpKkEiZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633962949489/BZhyIH4_w.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UVpKkEiZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633962949489/BZhyIH4_w.jpeg" alt="bloat.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real pain😢 I faced as a Windows user was having lots of application and programs that you do not require at that time or would never require it (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bloat"&gt;bloat&lt;/a&gt;), but they are still there, eating all you hard disk space and processing power. It just became really annoying😒! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why would I want to play Candy Crush Saga in my PC? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why do anybody want to watch advertisement in their own PC (Start Menu Ads)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More so, removing them just becomes a tedious task😩, as there are so many you have to uninstall or disable each and every one of them manually. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, Linux comes with just the &lt;strong&gt;adequate and necessary applications and programs required&lt;/strong&gt;🔥. Moreover, you can also get your required version (&lt;em&gt;with only required applications and programs&lt;/em&gt;) of setup too, which means, if you are a hacker, you can install distros like Kali, which provide exactly the right applications and programs for you✨. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#13-software-packages-and-updates"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  13. Software Packages and Updates 🧑‍💻
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cGANhmXS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634611150639/GbmtfxWpn.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cGANhmXS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634611150639/GbmtfxWpn.png" alt="Screenshot from 2021-10-19 08-08-41.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linux is packed with hundreds of packages from a variety of repositories✨. You can install them from &lt;strong&gt;Software Center&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;which comes with nearly every distro&lt;/em&gt;) or use package managers. Just type&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;sudo pacman -S _SOFTWARE_NAME_&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 and you are good to go! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Package manager will also vary from distro to distro! Like, pacman for arch, eopkg for solus etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As opposed to other proprietary operating systems that force you to install updates (&lt;em&gt;sometimes full of bugs&lt;/em&gt;), Linux gives you &lt;strong&gt;full control&lt;/strong&gt; over how to install and update software🔥. Interestingly, Linux uses something called &lt;strong&gt;"Live Kernel"&lt;/strong&gt; which lets us install any update without need of reboot the system 😱.(&lt;em&gt;Again, Except the Exceptions&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-do-you-think"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What do you think??
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know down in the comment,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do you think about Linux as a personalized OS?✔️&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which OS do you use? Why?✔️&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DISCLAIMER:&lt;/strong&gt; Its not like that I hate Windows or any other OS, its just that I have slight preference for Linux over any other OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
