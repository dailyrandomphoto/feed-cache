  In an era of extra-short attention spans and a severely over-saturated media landscape, it can be a real struggle to get people excited about your creative output online - no matter how good it is.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're a regular DEV reader, chances are you've also written a blog post on a technical topic before - or you've at least thought about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What made you decide to do this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of y'all probably had a coding problem, and then you solved it in an interesting way, and you want to share your solution so that others might benefit from your experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we love you for that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the content creation alone is usually not enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you convince anyone to give up a few minutes of their day to read your blog post or watch your latest video - especially when you consider that we are all basically one click away, at all times, from watching literally any TV show or movie ever released?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You're gonna hate me for this, but the answer comes down to...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...did you guess it yet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#its-marketing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  It's Marketing!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know - I had &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt; interest in marketing when I first starting writing online. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years I neglected Marketing 101 because I hated the idea that I would be "manipulating" people somehow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't want to persuade anyone to do anything they don't actually &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to do!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at the same time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; want them to engage with this stuff that I've poured so much time and energy into. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't I?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well then, that's going to require some convincin', I reckon.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Years ago - long before &lt;a href="https://tanoaksam.hashnode.dev/learning-to-code-off-grid"&gt;I learned how to code&lt;/a&gt; and changed careers - I self-published &lt;a href="https://thegoodliferevival.com/shop/foraging"&gt;an ebook about edible wild plants&lt;/a&gt; and started selling it through &lt;a href="https://thegoodliferevival.com/"&gt;my Squarespace blog&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Surely,&lt;/em&gt; I reasoned with myself, &lt;em&gt;once people come to the site and read the very dry but informative description of the book and see that it meets their needs, the sales will naturally start rolling in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Crickets.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I got more serious about email marketing. I started running experiments with my list of about a thousand subscribers at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried doing it "on my terms" by avoiding the kind of standard marketing tactics that often turn me off as a consumer. The results were dismal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually I set aside my better judgement and ran a "this weekend only!" sale - you know the kind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This weekend only: take 25% off of my ebook. It's the deal of a lifetime so don't miss out! Hurry - quick - this offer ends Sunday at midnight!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sold more copies in that weekend alone than I had in the months since I originally launched the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn't force anyone to do anything. No lies or shady business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody communicated that they were unsatisfied with their purchase. Some reached out to thank me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's when I finally had to admit that maybe these kinds of marketing tactics are so common &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; - hear me out on this one -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;they work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...I know, groundbreaking stuff, right? :P&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In the years since that first product launch, I've wizened up considerably to the ways of online marketing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not afraid of being intentional about trying to sell what I create - because why else did I create it, if not to get it into the hands of as many people as I can?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Content marketing isn't terribly complicated. If you keep some basic guidelines in mind when you're crafting content and thinking about how you're going to present it to the world, you can significantly improve your ability to reach a much wider audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What follows is pretty much everything I've learned about creating engaging content in my ten years of publishing online, distilled down into as few words as possible. It's not a formula so much as a framework for optimizing your chances of success with any given piece of content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-provide-value"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Provide value
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'Value' is one of those buzzwords that's been shredded to pieces by shady marketers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do we actually mean by this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give your readers what they need!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or better yet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give them what they don't even know they need yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anticipate their needs and they'll think you're magical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of what you see on social media amounts to the &lt;em&gt;opposite&lt;/em&gt; of providing value: people want to &lt;em&gt;take&lt;/em&gt; from you, whether it's your money or just your attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach rarely leads to engagement, unless it happens to be controversial or provocative in all the worst ways (more on that momentarily).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your job as a content creator is to go out of your way to &lt;em&gt;give&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-frame-everything-in-terms-of-you"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Frame everything in terms of 'You'
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody cares about me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They want to know what I can do for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does this thing I've created solve their problems?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when I'm writing about myself, I am meticulous about framing every detail in terms of how it relates to 'you', my intended reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what I'm writing about, my goal is always to &lt;em&gt;give you info or advice that you can act on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you re-read the introduction to this post, you will notice that I was very intentional about framing the whole thing in terms of "you."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could have said "I am blogger on Hashnode, and I sometimes struggle to get noticed. Here's my strategy for increasing engagement."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead I went with "If you're reading this, you're probably a blogger who sometimes struggles to get noticed. So how can you increase your engagement?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They both convey essentially the same information. But I'd wager that you are about a thousand times more likely to be interested in the latter version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-seek-an-emotional-connection"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Seek an emotional connection
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the most popular things I've ever published online had some element of emotional appeal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ain't rocket surgery - people make decisions with their emotions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tough part is figuring out what actually resonates most with your audience. This requires being an exceptionally good listener.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also an area where it's important to tread lightly - people don't take well to having their emotions abused or manipulated, so when you go for the heart, it has to be genuine and not gratuitous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've had a handful of tweets go "viral" (by my standards anyway) on &lt;a href="https://www.twitter.com/tanoaksam"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. Almost all of them were about my career transition and contained a strong emotional hook that resonated with my readers. Crucially, they all came from my actual experiences - people can tell that I'm being authentic about what I'm describing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of course you don't have to tell some life-changing story in order to create an emotional connection with your audience. In tech writing, it can be as simple as "hey, have you encountered this problem before? Sucks, doesn't it? Well, I have a solution..." That's enough to establish a rapport with your reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-be-provocative-within-reason"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Be provocative, within reason
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the internet, the name of the game - for better or worse - is &lt;em&gt;engagement&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are most likely to engage with the stuff that elicits a strong reaction - whether positive or negative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a dangerous game, but the payoff can be enormous!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can be provocative while remaining positive - one way to pull this off is by making a strong statement about a belief that you genuinely hold, without watering it down via weasel words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my coding mentors encourages his students to cultivate "strong opinions, loosely held."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not "possibly maybe one of the best" - it &lt;em&gt;IS&lt;/em&gt; the best! Full stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, I could be convinced otherwise. But I want to instigate the conversation!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let people disagree if they want to! Maybe I hope to be proven wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be value in this kind of discourse, when it's done in good faith. That's easier said than done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yes, you can also generate a whole lotta engagement through negativity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But - trust me on this one - you're basically setting yourself up to become Emperor Palpatine, sustained purely by the toxic bad vibes emanating through the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marketing is a whole lot like The Force, honestly. It flows through all things in our galaxy, and it can be harnessed for incredible good or pure evil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't be like Emperor Palpatine. I don't think it ended well for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-be-generous-to-a-fault"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Be generous to a fault
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My policy for creating content has always been to give away the best stuff for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That has a lot to do with my personal ethics, but it's also the best way I've found to generate goodwill with an audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With everything you share for free, your goal should be to receive overwhelming feedback that "I can't believe they aren't charging money for this!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you give away your best work for free, you'll be amazed by how many people will circle back around to purchase whatever you might create in the future purely because they want to support you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If engagement is the currency of the internet, then cultivating goodwill is how you persuade people to invest in your work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing an audience is a whole skill set unto itself, but the ground rules I've laid out here ought to be enough to set up any blogger for maximum success over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Git, A Look Under The Hood - Prologue</title>
      <author>Mohamed ELIDRISSI</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 20:16:03 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/elidrissidev/git-a-look-under-the-hood-prologue-3c4m</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/elidrissidev/git-a-look-under-the-hood-prologue-3c4m</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Git is a free and open-source Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) initially created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 following the &lt;a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/130746/"&gt;BitKeeper controversy&lt;/a&gt; after none of the existing systems met his needs. Because Linus intended to use it for the Linux Kernel development, Git was designed to take into account performance, distribution, and safeguards against data loss. Fast-forward 16 years later and it is the de facto Version Control System (VCS) for software and an indispensable tool for every Software Engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can never understand everything. But, you should push yourself to understand the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Ryan Dahl (Creator of Node.js)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Git has excellent documentation and even a &lt;a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2"&gt;free book&lt;/a&gt;, but most people don't bother learning about it and instead only try to memorize the commands they use in their day-to-day work or rely only on GUIs that make everything seem magical, this leads to them peeling their hair in frustration as they start facing all kind of issues (looking at you, merge conflicts!). While one can certainly use Git with just basic knowledge, knowing how it all works under the hood will give you extra confidence and will make you a distinguishable engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this series, we will be going down the rabbit hole to try and demystify how Git works internally, and at the end, you'll come to know that &lt;strong&gt;Git is not magic&lt;/strong&gt;, its design model is what made it the powerful tool that we all love and hate (not anymore) today, so we must understand that before going any deeper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS: This is not a beginner's guide so a basic knowledge of Git is required&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#git-is-distributed"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Git is Distributed
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hear about Git being a DVCS all the time, but do you really know what that means? Before we understand the meaning of distributed, let's first talk about Centralized VCSs (CVCS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In CVCSs, nothing is stored locally, so all actions depend on a single remote repository. To commit code, view the logs, or compare your changes with other people's, you'll need to be online. Being centralized also means having a single point of failure. If the repository is deleted by mistake or the disks on the server crash, everything will be lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let's go back to DVCSs, when you do a &lt;code&gt;git clone&lt;/code&gt;, Git downloads the whole history of the repository and stores it in – its local database – the &lt;code&gt;.git&lt;/code&gt; folder. This means that you can still commit your work locally when you're on an airplane or when the internet is down and push it to a remote repository when you're back online, and essentially all developers who cloned this repository now have a backup in their machine. This also has the benefit of being extremely fast, as most operations don't need to reach for a server.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QC3800Fl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fsuj3e2duqbw62m529gz.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QC3800Fl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fsuj3e2duqbw62m529gz.png" alt="Centralized vs. Decentralized Version Control Systems"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#git-takes-snapshots"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Git Takes Snapshots
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the key design differences between Git and other VCSs. These other systems store information as an initial file and the changes (diffs) made to it over time, Git follows a different approach and instead takes a snapshot (think a picture) of your whole files when you do a commit, now you might think that's expensive if you have a lot of files, but as we'll come to see in the next part, Git is smart enough to not store the same file twice if it hasn't changed and instead references the previous version of that file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kIOWhvJI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ptiux5owlbkcaqgaoj1r.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kIOWhvJI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ptiux5owlbkcaqgaoj1r.png" alt="How Git takes snapshots of your files on each commit (dashed lines represent a reference to the previous version of the file)"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important point to get from this is that Git acts like a mini filesystem, but with superpowers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#integrity-is-builtin"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Integrity is Built-in
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Git stores any file, it computes a 40 character long hexadecimal string known as a hash that serves as an identifier. To accomplish this, Git uses a popular hashing algorithm called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1"&gt;SHA-1&lt;/a&gt;. We'll see how it does it in the next part, but it will look similar to this: &lt;code&gt;a0b65939670bc2c010f4d5d6a0b3e4e4590fb92b&lt;/code&gt;. This makes it impossible for your files to change or get corrupted without Git knowing about it. Note that SHA1 is considered insecure nowadays, especially after Google released &lt;a href="https://shattered.it"&gt;SHAttered&lt;/a&gt; –the first practical collision attack against SHA1– in 2017 and &lt;a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/technical/hash-function-transition.txt"&gt;Git is planning to transition to SHA-256&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#file-states-in-git"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  File States in Git
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All files in a Git repository can either be &lt;strong&gt;modified&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;staged&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;committed&lt;/strong&gt;. Your files go into the first state when git detects that it has changed from the last version (remember the hash?) stored in its database. To save this change, you'll need to commit it, but first, you have to tell Git which changes you want to "prepare" for the next commit. This is accomplished by adding them to the staging area. Once committed, Git takes a snapshot of your files and saves it permanently in its database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--h1EI8PYc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/howfre4i0eqob431co6l.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--h1EI8PYc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/howfre4i0eqob431co6l.png" alt="Every file in a Git repository resides either in the working directory, the staging area, or the .git folder."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a short introduction to this series where we will uncover the nitty-gritty details behind Git internals. We started by first understanding the key aspects of the Git design model. In the next part, we'll see how this all comes down together as we discuss Git Objects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>"Working in Public" - a recommendation not a review</title>
      <author>jonasbn</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 19:30:57 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/jonasbn/working-in-public-a-recommendation-not-a-review-32p2</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/jonasbn/working-in-public-a-recommendation-not-a-review-32p2</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the podcasts from the Changelog I really really enjoyed (I actually enjoy all of them), was the &lt;a href="https://changelog.com/rfc"&gt;"Request for Commits"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hosted by Nadia Eghbal (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nayafia"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="https://github.com/nayafia"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;) and Mikael Rogers (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mikeal"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="https://github.com/mikeal"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The podcast covers topics such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;open source sustainability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maintenance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;economics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;licensing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I found out that one of the hosts: Nadia had published a book entitled &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0578675862/"&gt;"Working in Public"&lt;/a&gt; I had to get it. The book is not about sitting with your laptop in a &lt;em&gt;fancy&lt;/em&gt; coffeeshop in San Fransisco, but about open source, the complete title is: "Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The podcast has been retired now, but the whole back catalogue is &lt;a href="https://changelog.com/rfc"&gt;available&lt;/a&gt; and is definitely worth a listen if you are interested in open source - now about the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally find the whole open source &lt;em&gt;movement&lt;/em&gt; incredibly interesting and I have sort of grown up with open source, so books, articles and podcasts on the topics often catch my attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have previously read: "&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coding-Freedom-Ethics-Aesthetics-Hacking/dp/0691144613/ref=sr_1_2?crid=6DN0O6CI9DM7&amp;amp;dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=gabriella+coleman&amp;amp;qid=1621402581&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=gabriella+coleman%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C244&amp;amp;sr=1-2"&gt;Coding Freedom: The Ethics and Aesthetics of Hacking&lt;/a&gt;" by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BiellaColeman"&gt;Gabriella Coleman&lt;/a&gt; another book on open source, which is worth mentioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having been an open source consumer, contributor and maintainer for a long time, the topics related to open source hold an interest to me, only surpassed by the actual technical making of software. None of the above titles are about the technical part directly, they are about community, open source and understanding what open source is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nadia has worked for GitHub and her book is very much about &lt;em&gt;the GitHub generation&lt;/em&gt; as she calls it, which even though I got into open source long before GitHub and Git, the book really covers some aspects I have not come across before or seen covered in such a structured way. The books is not about &lt;em&gt;the GitHub generation&lt;/em&gt;, but it is founded in a period where GitHub and Git has been available and this defines a nice frame for the book and what Nadia wants to cover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book covers some interesting aspects of open source. One of the aspects, which really was eye opening two me and made me reflect on my open source involvement was the categorization of open source projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;High User Growth&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Low User Growth&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;High Contributor Growth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Federations&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Clubs&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Low Contributor Growth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Stadiums&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Toys&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above table is taken from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0578675862/"&gt;"Working in Public"&lt;/a&gt;, page 59.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found out that even though I had been doing open source for a long time, &lt;strong&gt;ALL&lt;/strong&gt; my projects had:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low User Growth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low Contributor Growth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my projects are all actually &lt;em&gt;toys&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was not really a surprise, I knew I was not making anything of significance, I actually make most of my open source stuff for myself, but it was interesting to reflect on this categorization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point a few years ago I decided to try to push myself to get involved in some more prolific projects. I wrote a blog post entitled &lt;a href="https://dev.to/jonasbn/blog-post-contributing-to-a-new-project--a-bit-like-starting-a-new-job-32o8"&gt;"Contributing to a new project – a bit like starting a new job"&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately the endeavour did not have the outcome I was hoping for and I slipped back into my comfort zone of &lt;em&gt;toys&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is absolutely nothing wrong with &lt;em&gt;toys&lt;/em&gt;, to me open source is primarily two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A platform for consuming software, I can use and on some occasions contribute back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A platform for me to experiment and learn, on occasion contribute back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets start with the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open source has learned me a great deal on the topics of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Programming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test and quality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bug fixing and bug triage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation writing and communication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automation and CI/CD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software releases and road mapping and planning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you could say that I am often just &lt;em&gt;scratching my own itch&lt;/em&gt;. Oftentimes I do not even need the software I make, but I find the problem area interesting or contained and a good case for a learning experience. Almost all of my experiments are open sourced, since I do not mind sharing. I know this is not really contributing back, but I put it out there just because it might be of value or interest to somebody else - like I have found open source projects that have inspired me or taught me something useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About the first part, I am a heavy consumer of open source and I use a lot of open source software, simply because it is easily available and it is sort of all over the community in which I navigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the urge to contribute to something significant, as described above, I have taken over open source projects from other maintainers, either because I was using their software or I had the ambition to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of this are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jonasbn/perl-workflow"&gt;Workflow&lt;/a&gt;, a simple, flexible system to implement workflows in Perl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions"&gt;Spellcheck GitHub Action&lt;/a&gt;, a GitHub action for checking the spelling of text in your documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use the latter professionally and for almost all of my open source projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workflow has been on quite an interesting journey. I have been close to abandoning it even though it has been one of the more successful projects I have worked on. Recently the project has picked up pace and currently I have been joined by two contributors and we are planning the future, improving the code, fixing bugs and shipping plenty of releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would even go so far as to say that Workflow has moved from a &lt;em&gt;toy&lt;/em&gt; to a &lt;em&gt;club&lt;/em&gt;, which is very satisfying and makes me want to continue to maintain and contribute. The project has actually gotten to 24 stars on GitHub - I find that amazing. All we do is work with the two other projects using Workflow and blog about it. Next step could be to see if we could obtain &lt;em&gt;stadium&lt;/em&gt; level - just kidding, but some more users and contributors could be beneficial to the project and lots of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of contributors, "Working in Public" touches on the topic of &lt;em&gt;casual contributors&lt;/em&gt;. This is a topic on which there are very differing view points. Nadia describes the difference between &lt;em&gt;active contributors&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;casual contributors&lt;/em&gt;. The first group are the kind of contributors, which stick around the project for a long time and contribute regularly. Whereas &lt;em&gt;casual contributors&lt;/em&gt; do not, they submit a PR for a single improvement/fix or similar and are then on they way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I myself am very much a &lt;em&gt;casual contributor&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have had PRs declined, sometimes because I did not know the project I was contributing as a whole or simply because I did not bring any value - I am sorry if this has taken up precious time for somebody, but I have always learned something, if not about technology, then about English spelling or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also experienced, moving from &lt;em&gt;casual contributor&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;active contributor&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A long time ago I was using Sublime Text and I was really getting into Markdown and I found &lt;a href="https://github.com/naokazuterada/MarkdownTOC"&gt;MarkdownTOC&lt;/a&gt;, a plugin to generate a table of contents for Markdown documents. I did some poking at the project, while working on picking up Python. I found the documentation a bit &lt;em&gt;unstructured&lt;/em&gt; and decided I approached the maintainer, who was most welcoming since he was not a native English speaker (neither am I) and started to contribute to the documentation big time. This evolved into a long term collaboration and I drop by the project from time to time or if the maintainer pings me and asks for assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been a &lt;em&gt;casual contributor&lt;/em&gt; to many projects and I recognize why some maintainers prefer &lt;em&gt;active contributors&lt;/em&gt; over &lt;em&gt;casual contributors&lt;/em&gt;, but some of us really want to help with a single thing and do not want to get involved full time in another project, but we want to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a feature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix a bug&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Document the implementation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Correct a spelling error or a broken link&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I for one welcome &lt;em&gt;casual contributors&lt;/em&gt; to my projects, I cannot allocate all of the time to my projects that I would like, so if somebody wants to do the &lt;em&gt;heavy lifting&lt;/em&gt; and all I need to do is review, squash and merge - please submit your PRs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have only mentioned a few of the topics covered from "Working in Public" and I have by no means delved into the book. The book covers a lot of material, without being a &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; read. If you are vaguely interested in open source - you need to read this book. The book really helped me to understand aspects of open source I thought I understood, it have me perspective on things I did not fully comprehend and it framed me and my involvement in a way, where I now understand the open source "community" even better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy coding ... and reading - and remember to check out the podcast.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What are the top 5 mobile apps that you use every day?</title>
      <author>Bobby Iliev</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 19:29:35 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/bobbyiliev/what-are-the-top-5-mobile-apps-that-you-use-every-day-mmj</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/bobbyiliev/what-are-the-top-5-mobile-apps-that-you-use-every-day-mmj</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a huge number of useful apps you can download. They could make your day more organized, better planed, less stressful. Besides, they would save you time.  Here are my TOP 5 applications I use the most on my smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#headspace"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/headspace-meditation-sleep/id493145008"&gt;Headspace&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Headspace is a guide to mindfulness for everyday life.&lt;br&gt;
There are hundreds of guided meditations on everything from managing stress and anxiety to sleep, focus, and mind-body health. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Headspace includes short 3-minute meditation sessions, which can fit into your busy daily schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app includes a lot of guided meditations on subjects like focus, exercise, and sleep. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#notion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notion-notes-projects-docs/id1232780281"&gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notion is a note taking app. It is an application that provides components such as databases, kanban boards, wikis, calendars, and reminders. You can connect these components to create your own systems for knowledge management, note-taking, and etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app can be considered as an all-in-one workspace for note-taking, knowledge and data management, project, and task management. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tool helps you to schedule tasks, manage files, save documents, and set a reminder for the weekly schedule, enabling you to organize your work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#podcasts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-podcasts/id525463029"&gt;Podcasts&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Podcasts have been a big part of my daily routine. It is a great way to gather new ideas while stuck in traffic,  making dinner, washing the dishes, or walking in the park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use the Apple podcasts app, but there are a lot of other apps out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of my favourte non-tech podcasts series are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://wondery.com/shows/american-innovations/"&gt;American Innovations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://wondery.com/shows/imagined-life/"&gt;Imagined life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://wondery.com/shows/the-next-big-idea"&gt;The next big idea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#daily-yoga"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/daily-yoga-workout-fitness/id545849922"&gt;Daily Yoga&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daily Yoga, an app that offers interactive Yoga workouts. It is focused on providing intuitive and comprehensive yoga training for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are more than 100 yoga and meditation classes to help people from all levels. Besides that, there are a series of beginner-friendly tutorials to help you find a different and better self in only two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I work on a desk, and I often have back pain, this app helps me to stretch the muscles and to relieve that pressure from the stressful day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#spending-tracker"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spending-tracker/id548615579"&gt;Spending tracker&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spending Tracker is a personal finance app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am trying to save money every month. Likewise, for me, it's essential to track my money and manage the expenses. With this app, I can stick and easily manage my budget. I also could see how much I spent last year and easily compare every week, month, or year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am curious to hear what are the top apps that you use every day?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Automatically protect your supply chain from dependency confusion</title>
      <author>Andreas Sommarström</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 19:10:23 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/sumstrm/automatically-protect-your-supply-chain-from-dependency-confusion-2n35</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/sumstrm/automatically-protect-your-supply-chain-from-dependency-confusion-2n35</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dependency confusion&lt;/strong&gt; occurs when a system or user is tricked into fetching a package version from a public registry, instead of the intended &lt;strong&gt;trusted&lt;/strong&gt; package with the same namespace from your private registry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like other supply chain attacks it’s all about injecting non-intended packages into a vulnerable supply chain, where malicious code can be executed on installation. A critical security threat for your supply chain if left uncontrolled. And a problem that potentially gets even worse in automated environments like CI/CD pipelines, if left unnoticed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/sumstrm/control-your-npm-packages-avoid-dependency-confusion-1cjh"&gt;My previous post&lt;/a&gt; on the topic was focused on how to use security focused package management to improve control of the software supply chain.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post focuses instead on a solution that automatically protects your supply chain against dependency confusion. A scalable solution that is safe by default and prevents internal packages from being replaced by packages from external sources, without requiring  complex configurations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-automatically-protect-against-dependency-confusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to automatically protect against dependency confusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enforcing this protection from dependency confusion is based on using &lt;a href="https://bytesafe.dev/"&gt;Bytesafe&lt;/a&gt; registries for the private and public npm packages you depend on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OoyXfYrd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/iaquz717z5mj9ikexj87.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OoyXfYrd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/iaquz717z5mj9ikexj87.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bytesafe offers fully managed and private npm registries that allow users to better control their supply chain and secure the private and public packages they depend on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Bytesafe any package version marked as internal, either automatically or manually, will be protected from dependency confusion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The solution in short:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Package versions published, pushed or uploaded to an internal registry will automatically be flagged as internal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fetching new versions of internal packages from upstream sources, will only consider upstreams with internal versions of the same package&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s as simple as that. Package versions added directly by users are automatically marked as &lt;strong&gt;internal&lt;/strong&gt;, making sure internal packages are not exposed by mistake. And the best part, all the complex logic behind resolving dependencies safely is handled by Bytesafe, instead of being pushed on to our users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Packages &lt;em&gt;without the internal flag&lt;/em&gt; will function as they always have, with full access to public upstreams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users can continue to use registries for both public and private packages, enjoying the benefits of a single source of truth for all package dependencies. While simultaneously being fully protected from dependency confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#example-publish-internal-packages-to-a-private-registry"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Example: Publish internal packages to a private registry
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publishing internal packages to a private registry allows them to be shared and available for other team members and systems.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;npm &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--registry&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'https://workspace.bytesafe.dev/r/your-internal-registry/'&lt;/span&gt; publish

...

+ your-internal-package@4.5.6
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the target registry flagged as &lt;em&gt;internal&lt;/em&gt; the version will automatically be flagged &lt;em&gt;internal&lt;/em&gt; as well. Preventing it from being substituted by package versions from untrusted external sources.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GbFu8gnk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fhh0uevgznxqg3dnwblu.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GbFu8gnk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fhh0uevgznxqg3dnwblu.png" alt="example-internal-package-in-bytesafe"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#protection-during-dependency-resolution-npm-install"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Protection during dependency resolution (npm install)
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core protection of internal packages is evident when resolving dependencies from upstream. This is typically the case when using &lt;code&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt; to install dependencies for a project and &lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt; attempts to fetch all available versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any attempt to fetch new versions of internal packages will only use upstreams that contain other internal versions of the packages. All other sources will be ignored for the purpose of this action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users can securely install any internal version from their registries, without ever having to worry about the possibility of the package being replaced with a malicious package from any external registry. A protection that scales to all users and systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#example-using-a-bytesafe-private-registry-together-with-registrynpmjsorg-as-an-upstream-for-public-packages"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Example: Using a Bytesafe private registry together with registry.npmjs.org as an upstream for public packages
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qUgnCepM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kzhdfmsoj26g9wwpvftk.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qUgnCepM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kzhdfmsoj26g9wwpvftk.png" alt="internal-registry-example"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Package published to the private registry will be flagged internal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install of internal package by other users / systems will never fetch versions from registry.npmjs.org as it does not contain internal versions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installing any public package will work as normal, with registry.npmjs.org as a valid upstream&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#getting-started-how-to-protect-your-supply-chain"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Getting started - How to protect your supply chain
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any new Bytesafe workspaces and registries come with protection from dependency confusion by default - No additional actions required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create your own &lt;a href="https://login.bytesafe.dev/signup"&gt;Bytesafe Workspace&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publish your internal packages to the private registry. They will automatically be marked internal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install/add your other public dependencies. All dependencies are continuously monitored for security issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With both public and private dependencies now in one single source of truth, you can distribute this secure source to all team members and systems. A solution that scales across your whole organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/milindsoorya/8-underrated-git-commands-every-programmer-should-know-not-the-usual-pull-push-add-commit-1p15</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be adding more useful git tips, if you find this helpful I suggest bookmarking this page. 🔖&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-rename-a-local-branch"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Rename a local branch
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;useful when you mess up the branch name with some typos.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Note: no need to include &amp;lt; &amp;gt;, separate words with -
git branch -m &amp;lt;new_name&amp;gt;
eg:- git branch -m new-new-branch
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-rename-the-upstream-branch"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Rename the upstream branch
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git push origin -u &amp;lt;new_name&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-makes-local-branch-same-as-remote"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Makes local branch same as remote
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At times we may make many changes to our local branch and end up with something that is worse than what we started with, don't worry everyone has been there 😅. This command will be helpful in those scenarios.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;// replace staging with the branch you want to reset to
git reset --hard origin/staging
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-delete-the-most-recent-commit-keeping-the-work-youve-done"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Delete the most recent commit, keeping the work you've done
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am amazed that not too many people know of this command, this will help to recover from those stupid typos that creep into our commits.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git reset --soft HEAD~1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-delete-the-most-recent-commit-destroying-the-work-youve-done"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Delete the most recent commit, destroying the work you've done
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use this command when you know you really messed up. don't fret it's part of the journey.🎯&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git reset --hard HEAD~1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-stash-your-work"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. Stash your work
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stash command is used to temporarily work on another branch without committing our current work.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git stash
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#7-recover-stash-by-going-into-that-branch-and"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  7. Recover stash by going into that branch and
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git stash apply
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#8-go-back-to-a-previous-commit-undo-a-rebase"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  8. Go back to a previous commit, undo a rebase
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is quite natural to mess up a rebase, these commands will hopefully save you. use reflog command to find the head number of the required commit you want to reset to.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Find the head at that point
git reflog 

// Replace 5 with the head number, please be extra careful not to 
// give wrong wrong head number
git reset --hard "HEAD@{5}"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Deploy a Next.js App to AWS Amplify</title>
      <author>Ali Spittel</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 18:41:16 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/aws/deploy-a-next-js-app-to-aws-amplify-3571</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/aws/deploy-a-next-js-app-to-aws-amplify-3571</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/server-side-rendering-amplify.html"&gt;AWS Amplify just announced server-side rendering deployment support for Next.js&lt;/a&gt;! Here's a quick guide on how to deploy both an &lt;a href="https://welearncode.com/ssr-vs-ssg/"&gt;SSR and an SSG&lt;/a&gt; Next.js app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: if you're new to Next.js check out &lt;a href="https://welearncode.com/beginners-guide-nextjs/"&gt;this tutorial!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ssg"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  SSG
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a statically generated Next.js app, you'll first need to edit your &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; file. You'll need to change your &lt;code&gt;build&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;next build &amp;amp;&amp;amp; next export&lt;/code&gt; instead of just &lt;code&gt;next build&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight diff"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;"scripts":&lt;/span&gt; {
  "dev": "next dev",
&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+ "build": "next build &amp;amp;&amp;amp; next export",
&lt;/span&gt;  "start": "next start"
&lt;span class="err"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ssr"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  SSR
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don't need to change anything in your &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; for a server-side rendered app! Just keep the one that was generated by &lt;code&gt;create-next-app&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#hybrid-ssg-ssr"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Hybrid SSG + SSR
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have an app with both SSR and SSG pages, also keep the default &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;, same as a fully SSR app!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#for-both"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  For Both
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, create a repository on your git provider of choice, and push your code to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/"&gt;Create an AWS account&lt;/a&gt; if you don't already have one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navigate to &lt;a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home"&gt;the Amplify Console&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click on the orange &lt;code&gt;connect app&lt;/code&gt; button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choose &lt;code&gt;GitHub&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;From your existing code&lt;/code&gt; menu, and click continue&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_GanIso8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://welearncode.com/beginners-guide-react-2020/choose-github.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_GanIso8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://welearncode.com/beginners-guide-react-2020/choose-github.png" alt="Amplify interface with different remotes"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type in the name of your GitHub repo you just created (it should autofill!) and then click &lt;code&gt;next&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QFQLPlqF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://welearncode.com/beginners-guide-react-2020/select-your-repo.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QFQLPlqF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://welearncode.com/beginners-guide-react-2020/select-your-repo.png" alt="Amplify interface with name of repo"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The build settings will auto-populate, and so you can just click &lt;code&gt;next&lt;/code&gt; on the &lt;code&gt;Configure build settings&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click &lt;code&gt;Save and deploy&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pricing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Pricing
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes, Amplify creates AWS resources used to deploy your app -- first an &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/"&gt;Amazon S3 bucket&lt;/a&gt; to store your app's static assets, then an &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing/"&gt;Amazon CloudFront&lt;/a&gt; to serve your app itself, finally a &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/"&gt;Lambda@Edge function&lt;/a&gt; to SSR pages. The links to each service in this paragraph leads to info about the pricing for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#multibranch-deployments"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Multi-branch Deployments
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to deploy multiple branches to AWS Amplify, you can click the orange "Connect branch" button on the &lt;a href="//console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home"&gt;Amplify Console&lt;/a&gt; page for your app. So, if you want to test deployments of features before they go live to the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; branch, you can do so in clicks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QjydU41b--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://welearncode.com/deploy-nextjs-amplify/connect-branch.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QjydU41b--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://welearncode.com/deploy-nextjs-amplify/connect-branch.png" alt="The connect branch button on the AWS Amplify Console"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pull-request-previews"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Pull Request Previews
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also enable automatic pull request preview deployments. This will enable Amplify to deploy a preview of each pull request to a project so that you can click a link and see what the pull request does to the site!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First click on &lt;code&gt;previews&lt;/code&gt; on the left side bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--liYk9bCD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://welearncode.com/deploy-nextjs-amplify/previews.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--liYk9bCD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://welearncode.com/deploy-nextjs-amplify/previews.png" alt="Enable previews in the AWS Amplify Console"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, click &lt;code&gt;Enable previews&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--C0oQYI1a--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://welearncode.com/deploy-nextjs-amplify/enable-previews.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--C0oQYI1a--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://welearncode.com/deploy-nextjs-amplify/enable-previews.png" alt="Enable pull request previews in aws amplify"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#add-a-custom-domain"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Add a Custom Domain
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also connect your domain name to your site by visiting &lt;code&gt;Domain management&lt;/code&gt; and then &lt;code&gt;add domain&lt;/code&gt; -- you'll see instructions for different domain providers or be able to buy one through Amazon Route53.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just some of the things you can do when you deploy an app to AWS Amplify Hosting! There are also ways to add testing, monitoring, custom headers, access control and more. I hope this guide was helpful for those of you looking to deploy a Next.js app to Amplify.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Scheduling API for Remote and Distributed Teams</title>
      <author>Spurwing</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 18:30:37 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/spurwing/scheduling-api-for-remote-and-distributed-teams-5dcf</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/spurwing/scheduling-api-for-remote-and-distributed-teams-5dcf</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Face it. Remote work is here to stay. It's opened up a treasure trove of benefits to companies and workers alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the new frontier of work after the world more or less goes back to normal, will be &lt;strong&gt;maximizing efficiency&lt;/strong&gt; even though the team may never be in the same room ever again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spurwing's Scheduling API can bring a level of organization and time management to your team so that it will seem like you're always in the same room together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BclyPzIP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4epvvh1i4a5bnawgg4gb.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BclyPzIP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4epvvh1i4a5bnawgg4gb.png" alt="appointment scheduling api for project management"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#projects"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Projects
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average company is in over its head with projects, and anyone project that gets neglected could endanger the company's reputation. Spurwing's Scheduling API can be used to coordinate which projects take priority and which ones can wait a little bit, as well as manage which people can be assigned to each project for maximum efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a new project that Allison would be great for. Let's assign her to it.. wait, no... she's already part of two teams on two different projects. Let's find someone else so that this project doesn't get delayed. That's the kind of bird's-eye level &lt;strong&gt;project management&lt;/strong&gt; that development with Spurwing offers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you have a project pop up that calls for the collective efforts of more than one team. No problem, Spurwing can also make collaboration easier with shared options for teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LXta5jOA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6y6arp8uzrknwzjme2ok.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LXta5jOA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6y6arp8uzrknwzjme2ok.png" alt="task management api"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tasks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tasks
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Projects are the sum of their tasks. If the typical company is flooded with projects then the number of tasks must be innumerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where Spurwing's time management capabilities really shine. When time management tools are properly implemented, you can collect all the lost minutes and seconds that add up to hours at the end of the week and turn them into time spent being productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spurwing's Scheduling API plus traditional tricks of the office, such as timeboxing, or even the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique"&gt;Pomodoro technique&lt;/a&gt;, will keep the ship that you run very tight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UYulxStA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2khplspfzsw4bekg50xj.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UYulxStA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2khplspfzsw4bekg50xj.png" alt="scheduling api"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#clients"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Clients
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah yes, the people that your company is accountable to for the way projects and tasks are handled. Spurwing's Scheduling API will help you keep track of which project belongs to which client and when they expect to see results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The law of averages states that you will eventually give the right report to the wrong client. Oops, I'm sorry, Client X. That deliverable was intended for Client Y. Clients don't see the 99% of accurate handling by your company outside of the 1% fumble with them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DdFzA9F_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cibad0lq0rd0ecexjgbs.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DdFzA9F_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cibad0lq0rd0ecexjgbs.png" alt="scheduling api"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#internal-reports"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Internal Reports
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all your bouncing back and forth between the people on your team, how do you translate their individual &lt;strong&gt;performances into reports&lt;/strong&gt; that show how your company is doing as a whole?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything from the movement of letters in the mailroom on the ground floor to how accounting is doing up on the 4th story influences the overall efficiency of your company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tools that can be developed through Spurwing's Scheduling API can condense all this complicated data into solid, understandable reports that can be reviewed and translated into plans of action.&lt;br&gt;
The solutions that can be developed through Spurwing are a gigantic step towards working smarter, not harder.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ever wanted to use Notion as a blog CMS? This guide will walk you through how to setup Notion for blogging and how to access the data using Notions public API.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notions public API is finally here! I put together &lt;a href="https://github.com/samuelkraft/notion-blog-nextjs"&gt;an example repo&lt;/a&gt; on creating a blog using &lt;strong&gt;Notion as a CMS&lt;/strong&gt; hours after the release and was blown away by the interest so here's a guide explaining how to set it up yourself using the new api &amp;amp; Next.js.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#getting-started"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Getting started
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're new to the notion API the first thing you need to do in order to start using it is to retrieve a &lt;code&gt;NOTION_TOKEN&lt;/code&gt; by following their &lt;a href="https://developers.notion.com/docs/getting-started"&gt;Getting Started guide&lt;/a&gt;. When following the guide create either a table or a list as the database for your content. After finishing you should have a &lt;code&gt;NOTION_TOKEN&lt;/code&gt; as well as a database id.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a Next.js project by following the &lt;a href="https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app/setup"&gt;Next.js app setup&lt;/a&gt;. The neat thing about using Next.js is that you can statically render all blog posts, while still updating them with &lt;em&gt;incremental static generation&lt;/em&gt; making your blog super snappy ⚡️.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This guide assumes you are using Next.js but you can use plain javascript or whatever framework you wish, the Notion code is the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Save your &lt;code&gt;NOTION_TOKEN&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;NOTION_TABLE_ID&lt;/code&gt; to a &lt;code&gt;.env.local&lt;/code&gt; file in your projects root directory, then install their javascript client by running &lt;code&gt;yarn add @notionhq/client&lt;/code&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#fetching-data-using-notions-javascript-client"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Fetching data using Notions javascript client
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's create a new file called &lt;code&gt;lib/notion.js&lt;/code&gt; which will contain all our API usage. To fetch our data we first need to create a client and supply it with the token we received earlier&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Client&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@notionhq/client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;notion&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;NOTION_TOKEN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then we need to add the functions we need. To get a list of our posts we need to be able to query a specific database (&lt;code&gt;getDatabase&lt;/code&gt;), to get the information for a specific post we need to get a specific page (&lt;code&gt;getPage&lt;/code&gt;), and to actually get the content of the page we need get its blocks (&lt;code&gt;getBlocks&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Client&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@notionhq/client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;notion&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;NOTION_TOKEN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getDatabase&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;databaseId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;notion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;databases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;database_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;databaseId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getPage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;pageId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;notion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;pages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;retrieve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;page_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pageId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getBlocks&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;blockId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;notion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;blocks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;block_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;blockId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;page_size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#showing-a-list-of-posts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Showing a list of posts
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add a function called &lt;code&gt;getInitialProps&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;pages/index.js&lt;/code&gt; where you use the getDatabase function to fetch all posts. The response will contain a &lt;a href="https://developers.notion.com/reference/database"&gt;Database Object&lt;/a&gt; containing information like the database title, when it was last edited as well as its properties (in our case blogposts).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; If you're new to Next.js getStaticProps allows you to pre-render the page at build time using the props returned by the function. Combining this with the revalidate prop will allow the page to get updated in the background as new traffic comes in without the need to rebuild your entire site. Learn more about &lt;a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#incremental-static-regeneration"&gt;Incremental Static Generation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;next/link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getDatabase&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../lib/notion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./[id].js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;databaseId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;NOTION_DATABASE_ID&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;posts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;ol&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;styles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;posts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;posts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
             &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;properties&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;ol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getStaticProps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;database&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getDatabase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;databaseId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;posts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;database&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Next.js will attempt to re-generate the page:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// - When a request comes in&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// - At most once every second&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;revalidate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// In seconds&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; We're using the post id as slug for sake of simplicity in this tutorial. For SEO purposes it would be better to use a prettier slug based on the title. You can do this by either manually adding a slug property to each post in Notion or generating a slug with a package like &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/slugify"&gt;slugify&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uhm, what is that &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Text /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; component you might ask? Notion has a lot of rich text tools allowing you to &lt;strong&gt;format&lt;/strong&gt; text &lt;del&gt;like&lt;/del&gt; &lt;em&gt;this,&lt;/em&gt; so instead of just returning a plain text value each text-like field returns an array of &lt;a href="https://developers.notion.com/reference/rich-text"&gt;Rich text objects&lt;/a&gt; like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;annotations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;bold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;italic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;strikethrough&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;underline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;plain_text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Hello world!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Hello world!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In order to handle links and annotations let's create a component that we can re-use for all types of text:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;styles&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;./text.module.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;annotations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;bold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;italic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;strikethrough&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;underline&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;bold&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;styles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;bold&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;styles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;italic&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;styles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;italic&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;strikethrough&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;styles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;strikethrough&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;underline&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;styles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;underline&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.bold&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;monospace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;rgb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;242&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;242&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;242&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;4px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.italic&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;italic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.strikethrough&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;text-decoration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;line-through&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.underline&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;text-decoration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;underline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#showing-a-specific-post"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Showing a specific post
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's create a &lt;code&gt;pages/[id].js&lt;/code&gt; page that will show the content of each blog post&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Fragment&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getDatabase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getPage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getBlocks&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../lib/notion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;databaseId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./index.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;components/text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;renderBlock&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;switch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;heading_1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getStaticProps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getPage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;blocks&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getBlocks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;blocks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;revalidate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That's a lot, so let's break it down starting from the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as on the index page we are using getStaticProps to get the data so the page can be statically rendered. In order to know which post to render we'll use the &lt;code&gt;context&lt;/code&gt; parameter which contains route parameters for the current page. With the post id we can then use our two notion functions &lt;code&gt;getPage()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;getBlocks()&lt;/code&gt; and return the results as props to our component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using dynamic routes we also need to specify a list of availables routes and we'll do that with &lt;code&gt;getStaticPaths&lt;/code&gt; by mapping over the pages and returning the page id's.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#rendering-notion-blocks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Rendering Notion blocks
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;blocks&lt;/code&gt; prop contains a list of all the blocks as &lt;a href="https://developers.notion.com/reference/block"&gt;Block Objects&lt;/a&gt;. We have created a &lt;code&gt;renderBlock()&lt;/code&gt; function that will take care of displaying the different blocks. Simplifying this a bit, basically all blocks currently supported by Notions API is a "text-like" block. This means that we pretty much only have to use our Text component inside the respective tag needed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;switch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;paragraph&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;heading_1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;heading_2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="err"&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Open up the index page in your browser and click a post and you should see a working page displaying your content!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#notion-api-unsupported-blocks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Notion API unsupported blocks
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Notion API beta unfortunately not all block types are supported. The supported block types are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;paragraph&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;heading_1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;heading_2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;heading_3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;bulleted_list_item&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;numbered_list_item&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;to_do&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;toggle&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;child_page&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use a block that is not supported the page will display &lt;code&gt;❌ Unsupported block&lt;/code&gt;. At this time there's no way of getting around this other than using their private API which is not recommended and can change at any time. If you need more blocks than those available right now I would wait a little bit longer until all block types are available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#styling"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Styling
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide intentionally comes without any styles as you would probably just rip it out anyways. If you want inspiration I put together some very bare-bones styles &lt;a href="https://github.com/samuelkraft/notion-blog-nextjs"&gt;in my example repo at Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#thats-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  That's it!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You now have a blog powered by Notion! If you add a new blogpost or edit a post then the page will automatically get updated on the second hit thanks to Next.js incremental static regeneration. Check out my &lt;a href="https://notion-blog-nextjs-coral.vercel.app"&gt;live example here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Getting started with programming in Java</title>
      <author>Kumar Sanskar</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 18:23:29 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/kumarsanskar/getting-started-with-programming-in-java-3mie</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/kumarsanskar/getting-started-with-programming-in-java-3mie</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, it's &lt;strong&gt;day 3&lt;/strong&gt; of my learning Java journey and today we will move ahead in that by learning some components and how to write and compile our first program in Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to run and make programs in Java on your machine you needs to have something called as &lt;strong&gt;JDK&lt;/strong&gt; which stands for &lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;Java Development Kit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt; and can be installed from the respective website of oracle, you can also install its open sourced counter-part OpenJDK if you want to and YouTube as well as Google are always ready to help you in doing so, but with some advanced IDE's like IntelliJ you don't need to worry for that as they do it automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#jdk-consists-of-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  JDK consists of :-
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt; JRE (Java Runtime Environment)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt; JVM (Java Virtual Machine)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;u&gt; Java Compiler(javac)&lt;/u&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt; Libraries&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt; Development tools.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;JDK include JRE and other tool to develop and run programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;JRE includes JVM and the standard libraries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;JVM executes the Byte-code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#compilation-process-of-a-java-program"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Compilation Process of a Java Program:-
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this process is generally happens inside of JVM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source Code(*.java file) ----&amp;gt; given to javac compiler -----&amp;gt; Byte Code(.class file) -----&amp;gt; given to JVM -------&amp;gt;Native Machine code(binary code) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#now-we-come-to-final-part-of-the-blog-that-is-writing-and-compiling-our-first-java-program"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Now we come to final part of the blog  that is writing and compiling our first Java program:-
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;//package information
package.codes.main;

//name of the class "Main" - executable class
public class Main{
    // name of the method "main" - executable method
    public static void main(String[] args){
        // statement to print out to console or display
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I am assuming that with a prior knowledge of computer and IDE's everyone would be able to compile and check the output of the above program, also the line containing '//' are comments used to make it clear to a new person so as to make them understand what each line does in this program and won't be visible in the output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's catch up in another post tomorrow, till then keep learning keep growing also do let me know of any suggestion and improvements in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Routing in React for Beginners - A Complete Guide to React Router!</title>
      <author>Fahad Imran</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 18:16:44 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/fahadimran1550/routing-in-react-for-beginners-a-complete-guide-to-react-router-2gb5</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/fahadimran1550/routing-in-react-for-beginners-a-complete-guide-to-react-router-2gb5</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, you're trying to learn React.js. Maybe you've even built a couple of simple projects in it. Whether you're a new developer or have a bit of experience, you'll probably find yourself having to develop a web app with different pages and routes. That's when React Router comes into play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#whats-react%C2%A0router"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🤷‍♂️ What's React Router?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React Router provides an easy way to implement routes in your React or React Native applications. It's fairly simple to get started. In this guide, I will explain how to easily implement routing in React applications. 🚀&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complete code for this project can be found on &lt;a href="https://github.com/fahadimran1550/react-router-demo"&gt;my GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/5zf2M4HgjjWszLd4a5/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/5zf2M4HgjjWszLd4a5/giphy.gif" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installing-react%C2%A0router"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  👨‍💻 Installing React Router
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to get started with routing, you'll need to install the &lt;code&gt;react-router-dom&lt;/code&gt; npm package. This can be done by issuing the following command:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;npm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dom&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Great work! Now that you have installed the React Router, you can follow along with the rest of the tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-the-basic-app-structure"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🛠️ Creating the Basic App Structure
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to create routes, you'll have to import &lt;code&gt;BrowserRouter&lt;/code&gt; from react-router-dom. It's also a good idea to import &lt;code&gt;Route&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Switch&lt;/code&gt; along with &lt;code&gt;BrowserRouter&lt;/code&gt; as well.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;BrowserRouter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Switch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react-router-dom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It's a standard practice to import &lt;code&gt;BrowserRouter&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;Router&lt;/code&gt; in React.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create routes, you'll need to wrap everything inside of App.js in &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Router&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags. This ensures that your routes will be accessible throughout the application. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, your App.js structure will start to look something like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;BrowserRouter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react-router-dom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* Your routes will go here */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#defining-your%C2%A0routes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  📍 Defining your Routes
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to actually define your routes, you'll use the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Route&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Route&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; takes &lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt; parameters i.e. &lt;code&gt;path&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;component&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;path&lt;/code&gt; is where you want your route to go, and the &lt;code&gt;component&lt;/code&gt; is the React component you want to render on that route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's create 2 components, a &lt;code&gt;Home&lt;/code&gt; and an &lt;code&gt;About&lt;/code&gt; component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aboutjs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  About.js
&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;About&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"p-3"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"h5"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;About Component! 📢&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;About&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#homejs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Home.js
&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Home&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"p-3"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"h5"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Home Component! 👨‍💻&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now let's define our routes as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;BrowserRouter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react-router-dom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/about"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;About&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Great! Now try to run the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll notice an issue here. When you navigate to the &lt;code&gt;/about&lt;/code&gt; route, you'll see both the &lt;code&gt;About&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;Home&lt;/code&gt; components being rendered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--R9fA1Hed--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pr88jal1romb56te61u1.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--R9fA1Hed--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pr88jal1romb56te61u1.PNG" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-is-this-happening"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why is this happening? 🤨
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason is that when you navigate to &lt;code&gt;/about&lt;/code&gt; route, both routes are being matched since both of them begin with &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;react-router&lt;/code&gt; by default will try to match all the routes even after a route is matched. Thus, we see both components displayed on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to fix this issue, you'll need to wrap your routes inside of &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Switch&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Begin by importing &lt;code&gt;Switch&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;react-router-dom&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;BrowserRouter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Switch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react-router-dom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then wrap your routes inside of &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Switch&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"h-100"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* switch to stop matching after match found */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Switch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/about"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;About&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Switch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Switch&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; will only render the first component that matches the path. Once, a route is matched, it will not try to look for another matching route. Thus, your components will render correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now try to run the application and observe the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#we-have-another-issue"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  We have another issue! 🚨
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you navigate to &lt;code&gt;/about&lt;/code&gt; route, you'll still see the home component being rendered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8J36hhl1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hqttd3ws9imogmmf58jv.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8J36hhl1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hqttd3ws9imogmmf58jv.PNG" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-is-that"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why is that? 😣
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason being that both of my routes begin with &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;. Thus, once the home route is matched, since we are using &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Switch&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;react-router&lt;/code&gt; will not try to match the second route. And the &lt;code&gt;Home&lt;/code&gt; component would be rendered in any case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to fix this, you can do one of two things. Either move the route for the &lt;code&gt;Home&lt;/code&gt; component to the bottom.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"h-100"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* switch to stop matching after match found */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Switch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/about"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;About&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* More routes will go here */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Switch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is useful is cases where you don't strictly want to match the exact route. So, even if say your users go to &lt;code&gt;/about/me&lt;/code&gt; the &lt;code&gt;About&lt;/code&gt; component will be rendered. Like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8T5lTxFB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6urkx6bywukjsfe25ksh.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8T5lTxFB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6urkx6bywukjsfe25ksh.PNG" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to strictly match all the defined routes however, then you can use the &lt;code&gt;exact&lt;/code&gt; keyword. This ensures that the router will match the entire path and only render a component which has &lt;strong&gt;exactly&lt;/strong&gt; the same path as defined by the route.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"h-100"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* switch to stop matching after match found */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Switch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;exact&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/about"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;About&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Switch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now you should see the correct components being rendered on the screen. 🙌&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, you can define as many routes as you require, in the same manner inside the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Switch&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#using-the-routes-via-raw-link-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🔗 Using the Routes via &lt;code&gt;Link&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you have created your routes, you can use them in your application. In order to use any route, you can use &lt;code&gt;Link&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;react-router-dom&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react-router-dom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And use it as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/about"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  About
&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;to&lt;/code&gt; is the path you want the Link to go to. As soon as the link is clicked, the &lt;code&gt;/about&lt;/code&gt; route will be hit and the &lt;code&gt;About&lt;/code&gt; component will be rendered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before proceeding further, let's create a couple of components so we can begin using them in a Navbar. Feel free to copy paste the code for these components. This entire project is also available on &lt;a href="https://github.com/fahadimran1550/react-router-demo"&gt;my GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#contactjs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Contact.js
&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Contact&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"p-3"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"h5"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Contact Component! 📪&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Contact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#postsjs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Posts.js
&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Posts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"p-3"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"h5"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Posts Component! 🦄&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;View specific posts at posts/id&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Posts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#postjs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Post.js
&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"p-3"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"h5"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Post Number: 5 🦉&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, we can now create a Navbar and use &lt;code&gt;Link&lt;/code&gt; to switch between different routes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react-router-dom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Navbar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;nav&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"navbar navbar-expand-sm navbar-dark bg-dark"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"navbar-brand"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        React Router
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"navbar-toggler"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"button"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;toggle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"collapse"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"#navbarNavAltMarkup"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;aria&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;controls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"navbarNavAltMarkup"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;aria&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;expanded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"false"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;aria&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Toggle navigation"&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"navbar-toggler-icon"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"collapse navbar-collapse"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"navbarNavAltMarkup"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"navbar-nav"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"nav-item nav-link"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/contact"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            Contact
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"nav-item nav-link"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/about"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            About
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"nav-item nav-link"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/posts"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            Posts
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;nav&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Navbar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here I am using Bootstrap for styling my Navbar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're using links in your navbar (as in most cases), you can also use the &lt;code&gt;NavLink&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;react-router-dom&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between &lt;code&gt;Link&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;NavLink&lt;/code&gt; is that with &lt;code&gt;NavLink&lt;/code&gt;, you can add additional styles to the Link. One of them is the &lt;code&gt;activeClassName&lt;/code&gt; which is applied by default. It will highlight the selected Link in the Navbar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0j4eXuZ6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ejt0rmrxbaermlxrx3fu.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0j4eXuZ6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ejt0rmrxbaermlxrx3fu.PNG" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's all well and good, but there is another way that you can access routes in your applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is by using the &lt;code&gt;history&lt;/code&gt; object. The &lt;code&gt;history&lt;/code&gt; object can be accessed via props inside any component.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Home&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;history&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"p-3"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"h5"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Home Component! 👨‍💻&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thus, in order to change the path, you can use &lt;code&gt;history.push()&lt;/code&gt;. In order to change the path on button click for example, you would do something like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Home&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;history&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"p-3"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"h5"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Home Component! 👨‍💻&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"btn btn-primary"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;history&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/about&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        About
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;history.push()&lt;/code&gt;, you can specify the path that you want to go to as shown in the above example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-dynamic-routes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ⚡ Creating Dynamic Routes
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to make your routes dynamic, you can use URL parameters and define your routes as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/posts/:id"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here, the &lt;code&gt;:id&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the path can change dynamically and can take up any string value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, say you want to access that value inside a react component. You can do so by using the &lt;code&gt;match&lt;/code&gt; object. The match has a property of &lt;code&gt;params&lt;/code&gt; which can be used to access the dynamic path value. The match object can be accessed via props, similar to the history object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll now modify the &lt;code&gt;Post&lt;/code&gt; component to get the value of URL dynamically:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;match&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"p-3"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"h5"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Post Number: &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; 🦉&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here the &lt;code&gt;match.params.id&lt;/code&gt; will include the id value specified in the path as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Jqzn0Bc7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1h29ykzogz3uh97d6ths.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Jqzn0Bc7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1h29ykzogz3uh97d6ths.PNG" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that the value from the URL i.e. 7 is also being rendered in the component. Thus, in this way, you can make your routes dynamic and access URL parameters in your react components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#error-handling"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ⛔ Error Handling
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a quick tip about creating &lt;code&gt;404&lt;/code&gt; routes in your applications. You can define a route for &lt;code&gt;404&lt;/code&gt; errors as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* if does not match any route, then 404 route */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notice, it's the same route as our home route, but we define this route at the end, and more importantly we omit the &lt;code&gt;exact&lt;/code&gt; keyword. Since, we are using &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Switch&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags, if none of the above routes match, then this route will be matched every time and will display the custom component we have created for &lt;code&gt;404&lt;/code&gt; routes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's an example of this in action:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PlL4KWGv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ntzzauaomisv08u0xeew.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PlL4KWGv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ntzzauaomisv08u0xeew.PNG" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, here's the final product:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vJATq6wd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/coi0px4g380wsh7nyoq6.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vJATq6wd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/coi0px4g380wsh7nyoq6.gif" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  👋 That's All Folks!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, that pretty much sums it up. I am in no way an expert, but I thought about sharing a simple guide on the basics of React Router and how to implement it in your React apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions feel free to ask me in the comments and I will do my best to answer them. If you enjoyed reading this article, please give it a ❤, or 🦄, or 🔖.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until next time, thanks for reading and happy coding! 😀&lt;/p&gt;
