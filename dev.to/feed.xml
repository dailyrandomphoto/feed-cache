      <description>&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most complicated and greatest asset a human being can have is the processing power between your ears. This in mind, investing in this supercomputer is the greatest gift you can give yourself. Amazingly, scientists think that the average humans only use 12% of their brain! Very few of us take time or allocate resources to train our brains. Neuroscientists believe that we are stuck with the same brain we were born with! The good news is that you don’t need to be a billionaire to improve memory or your thinking capacity. Think of your brain as a muscle that needs to be exercised. All you need to do is dedicate some few minutes every day to do some exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-exercise-regularly"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Exercise regularly
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as you take time to do some physical exercises, you should allocate time to do some mind exercises. Mind exercises improve mind fitness just the same way physical exercises improves physical fitness. Neurologists have proven that regular exercises of the brain enhances brain functioning and improves neurogenesis. Physical exercises have also been linked to the formation of new brain cells and thus you should stay physically active too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-train-your-memory"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Train your memory
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t use your brain, it will stagnate. If you want your dog to be a better fetcher, you must train or get it trained to fetch. Likewise, if you need you brain to be better; you must train your mind to retain memory. Discipline yourself to memorize phone numbers and other essential numbers (passport, credit card, insurance, driving license). The more you add to your brain, the more you expand its capacity!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-nourish-your-brain-with-a-healthy-diet"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Nourish your brain with a healthy diet
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The food you eat is, without doubt, a big contribution to proper brain functioning. The human brain consumes over 20% of all the oxygen and nutrients that we consume! Feed your brain with good stuff like fresh fruit and vegetables and plenty of Omega 3 oils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-question-facts-and-think-positive"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Question facts and think positive
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t take everything at face value. Develop a habit of questioning everyday things. Ask yourself the “what if questions”. What if we didn’t invent the wheel? What if the continents moved? By being curious, you train your mind to be innovative and develop ideas. They say curiosity killed the cat, but they don’t tell you that the same curiosity created electricity. Neuroscientists, have linked anxiety and stress to the killing of brain neurons and also hamper new neurons being created. Psychologist have found out that positive thinking, especially in the future, boosts the production of new cells and dramatically controls stress and reduces anxiety.&lt;br&gt;
Free your mind from anything which is not right here and right now. Staying mindful and in a present REALITY is the healthiest thing you can do to your brain. I don’t mean the virtual reality or social media reality but the REAL reality. As a result, you stop expecting too much from other people, which gives you the chance to truly enjoy their company and spend some quality time together. It also leads to finding contentment and peace. Happiness, after all, can’t be found anywhere else, but in the present. So without trying to make things perfect, to change anything about the current situation, or to wish for something that sounds better, you can enjoy what is by truly accepting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-read-read-read"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Read! Read! Read!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading not only relieves tension and stress to the brain-cells but it also gives you another perspective on things. Books are the best way to grow your brain and expand your thinking, but social media and magazines are a good source of humor and everything that can’t fit into a book. Reading is the best way to train your brain and expand your thinking. Read books which are not only fun but also expand your knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-get-enough-sleep"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. Get enough sleep
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sleeps is the reset button for the brain. When you sleep, your body regenerates brain cells and does all the maintenance work on both your body and your brain. A daily dose of 4–6 hours of sleep every night has proven the best way to improve thinking and create new ideas and innovations. Mindfulness meditation before falling asleep can be really helpful. Close your eyes and ignore everything around you. Imagine you’re at a peaceful place. Breathe deeply and empty your mind. Focus on your breathing for a while until you relax your body and mind.&lt;br&gt;
Know you’ve done your best for the day, and that tomorrow comes with many new opportunities. Be positive about what’s to come. If these are the last thoughts in your head before you fall asleep, then you’ll be in peace and won’t have nightmares. Once you’ve slept enough and sound, be sure that tomorrow morning you’ll not only kickstart the day, but be super productive, present for the whole day and in a pretty good mood and able to focus effortlessly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#7-eliminate-errors-in-thinking"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  7. Eliminate Errors in Thinking
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to know the psychological side of thinking. Your brain prowess aside, we all make thinking errors. There are five different errors that psychologists have identified; Partialism, Adversary Thinking, Time Scale Error, Initial Judgment and arrogance and Conceit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Partialism:&lt;/strong&gt; Errors that occur when the individual observes the problem through ones perspective only. That is, an individual examines only one factor of the problem and most often than not, we arrive at a premature solution.&lt;br&gt;
Adversary Thinking: This is the “you are the one who is wrong and thus I should be right.” type of thinking. Politicians are the masters in this type of thinking and they use it to their advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time Scale Error:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a kind of partialism in thinking where the individual sees the problem from a limited time-frame. It can be likened to short-sightedness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initial Judgment:&lt;/strong&gt; Here, the individual becomes very subjective. Instead of considering the issue or problem objectively, the individual approaches it with prejudice or bias.&lt;br&gt;
Arrogance and Conceit: may also be referred to as the “Village Venus Effect” because like country people, who think that the hottest girl in their village is the hottest girl in the world, the thinker believes that there is no better solution other than that he has already found. This blocks creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tips for a Successful Data Science Project in the Industry</title>
      <author>Mersano Berant</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 09:03:39 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/mersano/tips-for-a-successful-data-science-project-in-the-industry-5alg</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/mersano/tips-for-a-successful-data-science-project-in-the-industry-5alg</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Your data science project is successful only if it brings some value to the company. The performance of these projects is not just measured in terms of accuracy; rather, the speed at which solution can be tailored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt to say that data science projects are usually time-consuming, but the ideal design is required to be simple and efficient. Many times, the system may experience a mistake in the middle, and then we may have to start over again. It is necessary to avoid such issues so that you can create more reliable and effective solutions, and they can be integrated into the platforms in minimal time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are new in the field of data science and are looking for some trusted ways to make an impact, this article is for you. Here we have listed few tips for leading successful data science projects in the industry:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Define the problem and objectives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you dive into a &lt;a href="https://dev.to/monijesuloluwa/how-to-setup-a-data-science-project-creating-a-virtual-environment-2hco"&gt;data science project&lt;/a&gt;, it is first important to understand what is the problem to be solved and what are the objectives. You may have loads of data in hand to process, but what if it is bad data. At the same time, you have to be careful about false positive and false negative costs in the system. It is better to analyze all such aspects before building a model so that you can work in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get full insights into the data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may sound logical. The field data may have several discrepancies, and they are required to be handled on time. The missing values can make it difficult to decide which of the available labels is accurate. Moreover, if you treat missing values in the wrong way, they can further harm the performance of the trained model. Therefore, it is important to understand data well so that you can take adequate pre-processing steps and make decisions about features carefully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keep it simple&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to mention that your prime goal with a data science project is to bring results quickly and accurately. Probably, your manager is also not aware of the possible solutions in the process. Sometimes, even a few simple solutions also turn out to be effective when they are handled well. The chances are that a simple model may perform better as compared to a super complex solution that demands loads of time. Experts always advise to at least solve the problem partially using a simple solution. Once you have created a value to the system, you can start implementing the complex ones if still required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Consult experts around&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possibly, you are not a single &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science"&gt;data scientist&lt;/a&gt; in your company. Therefore, it is always a great opportunity to work in collaboration with others and get some ideas on how they can tackle the specific kind of problem. It is high time to understand that no one knows everything; we always have something to learn further. It is better to collaborate with other data scientists in the company and brainstorm together on the problem. It may also help you break complicated tasks into smaller portions and do proper planning to execute them step by step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do error analysis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may be chances that your model works efficiently for one situation but fails to provide a reliable solution for another. This is where comes the need for error analysis. You may have to go through the entire model and make an analysis of possible mistakes. The idea is to troubleshoot the model in such a manner that it can work effectively with all different scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prepare report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This step is neglected by most data scientists. Your current model may have several important elements that could be useful for some future projects as well. But you may forget the steps and procedure by the next month. Therefore, it is important to prepare a detailed report highlighting what steps you took to prepare this model, what data you have used, and what specific queries were run on the system. This step is extremely useful to revise and refine the solution in the future and maybe useful to handle some future problems as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you have gone through the best steps to execute successful data science projects. It is also possible to hire a team of professionals for handling &lt;a href="https://www.cegeka.com/nl-nl/oplossingen/data-solutions"&gt;data solutions&lt;/a&gt; in favor of your company to receive incredible results.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Vue vs React: What to choose in 2021?</title>
      <author>Digitalya</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 08:32:31 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/digitalyaops/vue-vs-react-what-to-choose-in-2021-3bc</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/digitalyaops/vue-vs-react-what-to-choose-in-2021-3bc</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the start of a new &lt;strong&gt;web app development&lt;/strong&gt; project, any developer would have a burning dilemma: &lt;em&gt;What is the best framework for this project?&lt;/em&gt; While we can’t give you a clear answer, we’d like to suggest a new question: &lt;strong&gt;Vue vs React: What to choose in 2021?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3u115mDmoz4"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When deciding which &lt;strong&gt;JavaScript framework&lt;/strong&gt; to choose for an &lt;strong&gt;existing project&lt;/strong&gt;, it usually comes around to &lt;strong&gt;Angular vs React vs Vue&lt;/strong&gt;. For this article, we are going to make a head-to-head comparison between &lt;strong&gt;React and Vue&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-what-is-vue"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  13. Conclusion: Vue vs React: What to choose in 2021?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-what-is-vue"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. What is Vue?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Named by Evan You, its creator, a “progressive framework”, &lt;strong&gt;Vue&lt;/strong&gt; had its first public appearance in 2014. Initially used exclusively in China, this popular &lt;strong&gt;JavaScript framework&lt;/strong&gt; is now used worldwide and among the best options for developing intuitive user interfaces as well as Single Page Applications (SPAs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://v3.vuejs.org/"&gt;Vue&lt;/a&gt; features &lt;strong&gt;two-way binding&lt;/strong&gt; and uses a &lt;strong&gt;virtual DOM&lt;/strong&gt;—a copy of the actual DOM. However, the primary reason why people are drawn to this framework is its &lt;strong&gt;progressive design&lt;/strong&gt;—this allows developers to migrate already existing projects gradually. This can be done by moving each feature, one by one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vue is an &lt;strong&gt;open-source project&lt;/strong&gt;, continuously developed further and maintained by its growing community. There are a lot of big names that are associated with Vue, like BuzzFeed, Grammarly, Nintendo, Trustpilot, and many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7PFhOQsX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d5ig63oxa0lg3t8fbwvg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7PFhOQsX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d5ig63oxa0lg3t8fbwvg.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-what-is-react"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. What is React?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically not a framework, &lt;a href="https://digitalya.co/blog/is-react-a-framework-or-library/"&gt;React&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;strong&gt;JavaScript library&lt;/strong&gt; that is used in &lt;strong&gt;web development&lt;/strong&gt; for interactive elements on websites and UIs. Created by Jordan Walke while working at Facebook, React is also used in creating SPAs and mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This JS library grants a lot of flexibility since it uses components—isolated pieces of code—that can be used to create more complex logic and UIs. It also uses a virtual DOM to interact with HTML documents, but all elements are represented as js objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2IGuOkJ7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8631idw951nbq75lab6s.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2IGuOkJ7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8631idw951nbq75lab6s.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-vue-vs-react-performance"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Vue vs React performance
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to performance, since both &lt;strong&gt;Vue and React&lt;/strong&gt; share common elements, they’re generally equal. They use lazy loading to increase performance rates and lower &lt;strong&gt;loading times&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;virtual DOMs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;strong&gt;Vue and React&lt;/strong&gt; have excellent performance, each with its own advantages. For instance, memory allocation and startup times are a little better with Vue, whereas, at runtime, React takes the lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, there are situations where there is a clear difference in performance between the two. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The modification of a React component state triggers the re-rendering of all of the components in its subtree.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Vue, these dependencies are tracked—so unnecessary re-rendering is prevented.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the two, Vue can handle high frames rate—10 frames/second, as compared to React with 1 FPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-vue-vs-react-popularity"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Vue vs React popularity
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good way to measure the popularity of a framework or library is to see how many stars their Github repositories have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eK2JV48b--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ilskiqfcr23v52hleqwx.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eK2JV48b--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ilskiqfcr23v52hleqwx.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, ever since 2017, Vue has been right there with React among the most popular frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of 2021, Vue has 181K Github stars—and can be considered the most popular &lt;strong&gt;JavaScript framework&lt;/strong&gt;. In the second place, React runs close with 165K stars—continuing to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Google Trends, over the past 12 months, companies were looking to &lt;strong&gt;hire React&lt;/strong&gt; developers, followed by Vue and Angular in a neck-to-neck battle. Having this in mind, React jobs are the most popular, followed by Angular, and then Vue—that’s how the &lt;strong&gt;job market&lt;/strong&gt; looked like in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another factor here would be the users of each framework. For example, amongst the users of Vue, there’s Trustpilot, BMW, Vice, Nintendo, Adobe Portfolio, Euronews, and many others. On the other hand, BBC, Airbnb, Facebook, PayPal, Netflix, Instagram, and a lot of other popular names, use React.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-vue-vs-react-state-management"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Vue vs React state management
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term state refers to the data that is shared between all your UI components. Naturally, as your system grows, it’s getting harder and harder to manage this. In such scenarios, React offers a single way of modifying the state—simplifying the debugging process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Redux&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GK0C6J9n--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4cmo3nh707ivthnzmjjn.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GK0C6J9n--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4cmo3nh707ivthnzmjjn.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Vue, this is managed a little differently. The local state is unnecessary since you can modify the data by using the data property of the object. Still, for larger apps, you need an external library for state management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vuex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--j4xuhVRc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ie4os6rlyboik7rdb98z.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--j4xuhVRc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ie4os6rlyboik7rdb98z.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#7-seo-vue-vs-react"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  7. SEO: Vue vs React
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use &lt;strong&gt;React&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Vue&lt;/strong&gt;, you get a SPA (Single Page Application) that needs Javascript to show any content on your page. Recently, Google announced that their crawl bot can now render paged wish JS and index them. However, most SEO professionals agree that even now Google has a hard time reading and indexing pages like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key to solving this issue is making sure that Google doesn’t need Javascript to render your content. For this, you can archive it by using Server-Side-Rendering (SSR). This means that you run the js code on the server before you send your files to the user for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#8-which-is-better-vue-or-react"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  8. Which is better, Vue or React?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no clear answer to this question. To get as close to the truth as possible, we should agree that it depends on the needs of the developer—each of these options is better than the other in very specific situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s analyze a couple of common situations where what you use can make a big difference:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vue is better if:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need a solution that works as soon as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your app isn’t very complex or you need it to be extremely fast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to migrate an existing project to a new technology, but have limited resources and time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your team is mostly HTML or junior developers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You prefer clean code and HTML templates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React is better if:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to develop a complex application or SPA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You plan on expanding the functionalities of your applications to a great extent in the future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need a mobile app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your team prefers JavaScript over HTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have experienced React developers on your team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you want to…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-web-apps-with-templates"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Create web apps with templates
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use Vue, you need to add attributes to an HTML layout. Vue.js has a clear advantage when it comes to speed and simplicity, thanks to its templates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React doesn’t use templates, so for this, you would need to launch DOM in JS. Working with templates in React requires you to know advanced HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-something-simple-and-efficient"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Create something simple and efficient
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, Vue has a simpler design. You can upload an app straight from your browser and the Vue library can be seamlessly added to the whole project. You can change values easily—the framework automatically makes the relevant changes in DOM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, compared to React, Vue can’t track data editing and deletion. React evaluates both previous and current actions and adds any relevant information to DOM. This is why you can’t modify any values directly with React.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#develop-a-pocketsize-quick-app"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Develop a pocket-size, quick app
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both frameworks work on similar mechanisms. However, there’s room for optimization everywhere. Vue is a little faster and is also smaller in size—25.6 kb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React is double in size—37.4 kb of DOM + 11.4 kb of library. Yet, React has the advantage of having a wider array of API options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#develop-an-enterpriselevel-complex-app"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Develop an enterprise-level complex app
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React tends to be better for larger apps—it’s more flexible and customizable. Vue uses templates, which makes the process simpler and faster. However, when complexity-levels rise, this is no longer an advantage. Most of the time, React’s code is reusable and can be easily restructured in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-both-web-and-mobile-apps"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Create both web and mobile apps
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to mobile app development, there is no question: React Native is the most used for cross-platform development. With it, you can re-use almost 99% of your JavaScript code between Android and iOS with React-like components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Vue has some options for mobile as well. First, there’s NativeScript with which you can write apps in Vue and compile them into native Android or iOS apps. Then there’s Vue Native. It appeared in 2018, so it’s not that popular (yet), but you can use this framework for creating cross-platform native mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#9-will-vue-replace-react"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  9. Will Vue replace React?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really hard to make such predictions, especially since each of these frameworks is excellent for different kinds of applications. However, we think it’s safe to say that React has a few bonuses when it comes to performance when compared to Vue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have to admit that the Vue framework is still fairly new to the spotlight—it will take some time and effort before it gets to the scale of the React ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#10-is-react-easier-than-vue"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  10. Is React easier than Vue?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to small applications—Vue shines. As we’ve mentioned before, it’s really easy to use, templates make everything fast, and so forth. However, the situation changes when your application grows—this is where React comes into play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the long run, React is more productive and easier to use than Vue. One big reason for this is that paired with React Native, it gives you the ability to develop web and mobile applications without too much extra effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a bottom line, the answer to this question can be summarized to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are familiar with JavaScript (like the NodeJS community), React will be easier and more productive for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you aren’t familiar with JS (like the Laravel community), Vue might be a better choice for you, at least for beginners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Digitalya is a software development company that creates both &lt;a href="https://digitalya.co/services/web-application-development-services/"&gt;web applications&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://digitalya.co/services/mobile-app-development-services/"&gt;mobile apps&lt;/a&gt;, we use React all the time. Here are some examples of applications from our Case Studies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-feetup%C2%AE"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. FeetUp®
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an application that aims to help yoga practitioners master inversion techniques from the comfort of their homes. With an extensive database of yoga, fitness, and relaxation classes, FeetUp® delivers a great user experience and quality content to people all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this project, we built a mobile app that delivers video and audio content to a large audience at the same time—all while tracking their behavior. We added in a highly customizable area for uploading content, moderating comments, and sending notifications. There are also community functionalities and an integrated shop, for the best possible experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--U-VK2DUF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b6mq5v8247q654eunm5m.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--U-VK2DUF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b6mq5v8247q654eunm5m.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-seihealthcare"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. SEI-Healthcare
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a web application that has a real-time visualization dashboard for tracking user interaction across medical quizzes. These examinations are timed and have various questions—users can select different answers for each query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We built a user-centered visualization dashboard that can be accessed through safe authentication. This web app is based on advanced algorithms that analyze gathered data through a set of predefined rules. It showcases 3D models of the results and these can be filtered based on user-roles and other selected preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kpMI4CwB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/egonc689yqkj8dbxp7oo.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kpMI4CwB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/egonc689yqkj8dbxp7oo.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  12. Examples of apps built with Vue
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-fontawesome"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. FontAwesome
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a website built with Vue. FontAwesome is a great resource for developers. You can find a wide variety of icons, styles, logos, and many more resources—easily accessible and there for you to simply grab and use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website is built with user-experience in mind and you can notice the low-complexity and ease of usage of the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-habitica"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Habitica
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a cool productivity app that you can use to track your habit-building process. The unique thing about it is that for every good habit that you learn, or any achievement reached, you get in-game rewards. Also, if you get off-track with your plans, you also get punishments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mobile apps—Android and iOS are built using the Vue frameworks and offer a creative way of organizing your lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#13-conclusion-vue-vs-react-what-to-choose-in-2021"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  13. Conclusion: Vue vs React: What to choose in 2021?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each framework has certain advantages over the other. For example, Vue is smaller and faster, it’s convenient due to its templates and has a simplified form of syntax. On the other hand, React offers more flexibility for larger, more complex apps. Also, it’s easier to test, more appropriate for mobile app development and you also have access to more information in case you have a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the answer depends on what you plan to develop. The best way to choose any tool for a particular problem is to test different options. You can try working on smaller things with both frameworks, and pick the one that suits you best.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Difference between a UX Designer and a Web Designer?</title>
      <author>UI/UX Design Services </author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 08:14:25 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/reloadux/difference-between-a-ux-designer-and-a-web-designer-2g35</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/reloadux/difference-between-a-ux-designer-and-a-web-designer-2g35</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most of us are often confused between UI UX designer and a web designer, but there is a significant difference between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UX represents the &lt;a href="https://reloadux.com"&gt;User Experience design&lt;/a&gt; and is popularly known as the invisible or behind the scene design side. The UX design company works on design and user research, interactive design, information architecture, content strategy, usability testing, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, a UI design company works for the website's User Interface design or graphical design. The UI designers know color theory, photo direction, motion graphics, typography, vector manipulation, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking about web designers, they need not focus on the UX approach for website designing. They can either be graphic designers working on the web or developers to design attractive apps and web app development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reloadux&lt;/b&gt; is a trusted name that can be relied on to get dedicated &lt;a href="https://reloadux.com/ux-services"&gt;UI/UX design services&lt;/a&gt; and passionate, experienced professional Expert developers or UI UX designers. It is one of the leading web agencies in USA, with its 50+ client base to mark its global presence. It brings the best of innovative ideas and creativity to UX design appealing web designs and mobile apps for any organization kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;UI designer:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UI designer's job is to create beautiful, useful user interfaces, but they can't build an interface base on personal preferences, they should build that interface base on the UX, so basically UI is part of the UX process, UI designer should be good at Knowing colors, design languages, typography, generally they should be really creative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;UX designer:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UX designer job is quite different, they try to create the best experiences for the users when they are using a product, it's more being logical than being creative, The UI is in that UX process, or a single person does all those processes which we call them UI-UX designers or they are a product team which they do all of these processes as a team, A group of professional people works on UI in the product team and another group work and UX, and a product designer direct these teams. so what are these interesting processes they working on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stakeholder interviews&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persona&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cart sorting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sketching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low fidelity design (Wireframe)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High fidelity design (UI design)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surveys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Web designer:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few years ago, it was very traditional, a &lt;a href="https://tkxel.com/web-app-development-services/"&gt;Expert web Developers&lt;/a&gt; does all of it, it's hard to believe but programmers which they don't know anything about UI/UX design and &lt;a href="https://reloadux.com/ux-process/"&gt;UX design process&lt;/a&gt; they do all of these, we called those people web designers, but now it's different, there people which design a website and they are people which they coding the designs, we call them Front-end and back-end developers. Front-end basically code the design and Back-end handle server-side programming, if you found someone which they do all this stuff, there is something wrong. Web design = Teamwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people call UI-UX designers web designers as well, some UI-UX designers they main focus is design interfaces just for the website, but generally, they do the design of both Mobile apps and Websites.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/awsmenacommunity/hybrid-cloud-with-aws-aws-whitepaper-summary-5g9b</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QlOXXJm8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mctmazwga064suas5jt7.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QlOXXJm8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mctmazwga064suas5jt7.png" alt="Dropbox-AWS"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In this whitepaper summary (originally published at November 2020), we will navigate through various offerings from AWS for hybrid technical and organizational adoption of cloud services. AWS is a pioneer in this field, as it understands the need to integrate cloud, on-premises and edge infrastructure of existing and potential customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, and with respect to the huge effort the contributors of this whitepaper did, we will try to update the information and figures the represent the current offerings. Finally, the inspiring use case of Dropbox adoption of AWS hybrid cloud will be presented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#considerations-of-hybrid-cloud-with-aws"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Considerations of Hybrid Cloud with AWS
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-a-hybrid-cloud-strategy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Create a Hybrid Cloud Strategy
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ongoing migration to the cloud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;o Ensuring business continuity during disaster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expanding on-premises cloud infrastructure to support low-latency apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expanding international footprint with AWS.
### Create a Technical Strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify the guiding tenets for hybrid cloud architecture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define guiding principles for a planned hybrid cloud implementation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#hybrid-cloud-use-cases"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Hybrid Cloud Use Cases
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#application-migration-to-the-cloud"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Application Migration to the Cloud
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;VMware cloud with AWS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; delivers a faster, easier, and cost-effective path to the hybrid cloud while allowing customers to modernize applications enabling faster time-to-market and increased innovation, especially with the &lt;strong&gt;new Amazon EC2 i3en.metal instances powered by Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cloud-services-onpremises"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cloud Services On-premises
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;AWS Outposts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a fully managed service that offers the same AWS infrastructure, AWS services, APIs, and tools to virtually any datacenter, co-location space, or on-premises facility for a truly consistent hybrid experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#data-center-extension"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Data Center Extension
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Cloud Bursting&lt;/em&gt;, with offerings of bursting for compute resource through &lt;strong&gt;Amazon EC2, Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, and AWS Fargate&lt;/strong&gt;, or bursting for storage through &lt;strong&gt;Amazon S3 APIs and AWS Storage Gateway&lt;/strong&gt; for block and file storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Backup and Disaster Recovery&lt;/em&gt;, with offerings such as &lt;strong&gt;Amazon S3 APIs, AWS Storage Gateway, AWS DataSync and AWS Transfer for SFTP&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Distributed Data Processing&lt;/em&gt;, where low-latency or local data reside on-premises, while asynchronous processing, archiving, compliance, business analytics processing and machine learning-based predictions reside on AWS. AWS offerings for those purposes include &lt;strong&gt;AWS Storage Gateway, AWS Backup, AWS DataSync, AWS Transfer Family, Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose and Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK)&lt;/strong&gt; for data importing, and leverage &lt;strong&gt;AWS Analytics, AWS Machine Learning, AWS Serverless, AWS Containers&lt;/strong&gt; for data processing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Geographic Expansion&lt;/em&gt;, where customers take benefit of &lt;strong&gt;AWS Outposts&lt;/strong&gt; in countries where AWS regions do not exist, and &lt;strong&gt;AWS Global Infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt; in countries covered by AWS regions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#edge-computing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Edge Computing
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AWS Snowball, AWS Snowcone and AWS Snowmobile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AWS IoT Greengrass, which is an open-source edge runtime and cloud service for building, deploying, and managing device software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AWS Wavelength for mobile edge computing applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#isv-and-software-compatibility"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ISV and Software Compatibility
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS has built the most complete and proven approach for rapidly migrating tens to thousands of applications to the AWS Cloud to help you leverage your existing on-premises ISV software investments.

      <title>a first look at qovery</title>
      <author>anthony-campolo</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 07:49:25 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/ajcwebdev/a-first-look-at-qovery-4897</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/ajcwebdev/a-first-look-at-qovery-4897</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.qovery.com/"&gt;Qovery&lt;/a&gt; is a CaaS (Container as a Service) platform for deploying fullstack applications to the Cloud with your own account on AWS, GCP, Azure, and Digital Ocean. It syncs to your git repository, detects your Dockerfile, and can integrate with a variety of &lt;a href="https://hub.qovery.com/guides/tutorial"&gt;open source web frameworks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setup-qovery-account"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setup Qovery Account
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a Qovery account at the following &lt;a href="https://start.qovery.com/"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#install-qovery-cli"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Install Qovery CLI
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install instructions will vary depending on whether you are using MacOS, Linux, or Windows. I will be using the MacOS instructions with &lt;a href="https://brew.sh/"&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt;, see &lt;a href="https://hub.qovery.com/docs/using-qovery/interface/cli/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; link for other operating systems.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;brew tap Qovery/qovery-cli
brew &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;qovery-cli
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#login-to-qovery-account-with-raw-qovery-auth-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Login to Qovery account with &lt;code&gt;qovery auth&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;qovery auth
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This will open your browser and ask for authentication through GitHub or GitLab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-project"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Create project
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start with a blank application and initialize a &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;mkdir &lt;/span&gt;ajcwebdev-qovery
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;ajcwebdev-qovery
npm init &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-y&lt;/span&gt;
npm i express
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;touch &lt;/span&gt;index.js Dockerfile .dockerignore
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'node_modules\n.DS_Store'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; .gitignore
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-indexjs-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Include the following code inside &lt;code&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt; to return an HTML snippet.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// index.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PORT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8080&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HOST&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;0.0.0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Running on http://&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;HOST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;PORT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#check-application-context-with-raw-qovery-context-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Check application context with &lt;code&gt;qovery context&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;context&lt;/code&gt; command lets you configure the CLI to work with your chosen application. Before executing other commands, you need first to set up the context. The context is then remembered and used by the CLI.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;qovery context
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;qovery context
Qovery: Current context:
Context not yet configured. 

Qovery: You can set a new context using 'qovery context set'.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#configure-a-new-context-with-raw-qovery-context-set-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Configure a new context with &lt;code&gt;qovery context set&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;qovery context &lt;span class="nb"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Qovery: Current context:
Context not yet configured. 

Qovery: Select new context
Organization:
✔ ajcwebdev
Project:
✔ ajcwebdev-first-project
Environment:
✔ dev
Application:
✔ express-server

Qovery: New context:
Organization | ajcwebdev              
Project      | ajcwebdev-first-project
Environment  | dev                    
Application  | express-server
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#check-your-application-logs-with-raw-qovery-log-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Check your application logs with &lt;code&gt;qovery log&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;qovery log
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;TIME                    MESSAGE                         
Sep  9 23:22:26.246670  Running on http://0.0.0.0:8080  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#check-the-status-of-your-application-with-raw-qovery-status-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Check the status of your application with &lt;code&gt;qovery status&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;qovery status
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Application    | Status 
express-server | RUNNING
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>My top 5 favorite newsletters to keep up with frontend development news</title>
      <author>Eli H. Schei</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 07:38:01 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/elischei/my-top-5-favorite-newsletters-to-keep-up-with-frontend-development-news-170j</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/elischei/my-top-5-favorite-newsletters-to-keep-up-with-frontend-development-news-170j</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It can be overwhelming to keep track of everything in the tech-universe - things changes so fast. And I have spent too much time on twitter, online newspapers and forums, scrolling my life away as I look for the things that are relevant for me and my developer journey. And then I realised I should let someone else do the scrolling. So I subscribed to a lot of newsletters  (and then unsubscribed to the ones that didn't quite give me what I wanted).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually just scan through the newsletters and save the links I want to read in &lt;a href="https://getpocket.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pocket&lt;/a&gt;. Then I try to block a 30min session in my calendar 2-3 times a week to actually read the things I save. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the top 5 newsletters I subscribe to - and actually read. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.stefanjudis.com/newsletter/" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.stefanjudis.com/newsletter/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stephan's Web Weekly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I love the mix of humor and usefull tips and tricks.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://javascriptweekly.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://javascriptweekly.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JavaScript Weekly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Nice collection of news, tips, tutorials, opinions and stories.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://frontendfoc.us/" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://frontendfoc.us/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frontend focus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Also a mix of news, tutorials, articles and stories. 
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.a11yproject.com/newsletter/" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.a11yproject.com/newsletter/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The A11y project newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;As the name suggests this newsletter is related to news in the accessibility (a11y for short) space
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://dev.to/" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://dev.to/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEV Community Digest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This is not really a news letter, but if you create a profile here on on &lt;a href="https://dev.to" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://dev.to"&gt;dev.to&lt;/a&gt; you will get regular emails with links to articles based on your interests. 
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you know about any good newsletters I should check out? &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Deploy a Python Django Application using PlanetScale and Koyeb Serverless Platform</title>
      <author>Edouard Bonlieu</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 07:17:52 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/koyeb/how-to-deploy-a-python-django-application-using-planetscale-and-koyeb-serverless-platform-2ffg</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/koyeb/how-to-deploy-a-python-django-application-using-planetscale-and-koyeb-serverless-platform-2ffg</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Django is a popular and powerful framework for Python application developers. Django comes with many features like authentication, content administration, an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM), and much more.&lt;br&gt;
Django supports various relational databases including MySQL which makes it possible to run a Django application using the PlanetScale database serverless platform without having to perform any changes in your application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this guide, we will create a Django application, configure our project to use a PlanetScale database, and deploy the application on the Koyeb Serverless Platform using git-driven deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Koyeb git-driven deployment, your Koyeb application is linked to your GitHub repository and each time changes are pushed to your repository, your application is being redeployed automatically by Koyeb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of this guide, you will have a working Django application running on Koyeb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#requirements"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Requirements
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To successfully deploy a Django application on Koyeb, you need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python installed on your machine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href="https://app.koyeb.com"&gt;Koyeb account&lt;/a&gt; to deploy and run the Django application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href="https://planetscale.com"&gt;PlanetScale account&lt;/a&gt; to run the database our application will use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href="https://github.com/"&gt;GitHub account&lt;/a&gt; to store your application code and deploy your application on Koyeb via GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#steps"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Steps
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To complete this guide to have a Django application running on Koyeb, you need to follow these steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#create-a-virtual-environment"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a virtual environment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#create-a-new-django-application"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a new Django application&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#configure-django-to-use-a-planetscale-database"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Configure Django to use a PlanetScale database&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#deploy-the-django-application-on-koyeb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deploy the Django application on Koyeb&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-a-virtual-environment"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Create a virtual environment
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before creating the Django application, we will create a virtual environment also known as a virtualenv. Virtual environments allow you&lt;br&gt;
to create an isolated Python environment to avoid interfering with the Python's system packages or other virtual environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a new virtual environment that we will use for our Django application, in your terminal run:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;python3 &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-m&lt;/span&gt; venv ~/.venv/django-app
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This command creates a new folder &lt;code&gt;django-app&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;~/.venv&lt;/code&gt; directory. The virtualenv contains a copy of the Python interpreter, pip, the standard library, and various supporting files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can now activate the virtualenv we previously created by running:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; ~/.venv/django-app/bin/activate
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once the virtualenv is activated, the virtualenv python and pip executables are added into your shell’s PATH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-a-new-django-application"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Create a new Django application
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start by creating a dedicated folder for our app and moving into it:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;mkdir &lt;/span&gt;django-on-koyeb
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;django-on-koyeb
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before creating our Django application, we need to install:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;django, to install the Django framework and libraries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dj-database-url, a Django utility that allows to parse DATABASE_URL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gunicorn, a pure-Python HTTP server for WSGI applications that can run multiple Python concurrent processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mysqlclient, the librairies to use MySQL or in our case Planetscale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mysqlclient requires system librairies, please check&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/mysqlclient/"&gt;https://pypi.org/project/mysqlclient/&lt;/a&gt; for detailled instructions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your terminal, execute the following commands to install the packages locally and save&lt;br&gt;
these dependencies.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;django gunicorn dj_database_url mysqlclient
pip freeze &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; requirements.txt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once the previous step is completed, you can create the Django application in&lt;br&gt;
our local directory by running:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;django-admin startproject django_on_koyeb ./
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This command creates a &lt;code&gt;django_on_koyeb&lt;/code&gt; directory in your current directory containing the following files:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;├── django_on_koyeb
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── asgi.py
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   └── wsgi.py
└── manage.py
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prepare-the-django-application-for-production"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Prepare the Django application for production
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we will edit the &lt;code&gt;settings.py&lt;/code&gt; file as we need to customize settings&lt;br&gt;
related to security and performance for&lt;br&gt;
our development and production environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open the &lt;code&gt;settings.py&lt;/code&gt; using your favorite editor, here nano:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;nano django_on_koyeb/settings.py
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We will edit the &lt;code&gt;settings.py&lt;/code&gt; file to load some important settings of our application using environment variables.&lt;br&gt;
To access and read environment variables, we need to import the &lt;code&gt;os&lt;/code&gt; module.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pathlib&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Path&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Django also requires a &lt;code&gt;SECRET_KEY&lt;/code&gt;. This key is used to provide cryptographic signing and should be set to a unique, unpredictable value.&lt;br&gt;
By default, we will want to generate a random secret key when nothing is passed as an environment variable, i.e. when you are running in development mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To generate a random secret key, we will need to import &lt;code&gt;from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;django.core.management.utils&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;get_random_secret_key&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pathlib&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Path&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Search for the &lt;code&gt;SECRET_KEY = ...&lt;/code&gt; line in the &lt;code&gt;settings.py&lt;/code&gt; file and replace it as below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SECRET_KEY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;environ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'DJANGO_SECRET_KEY'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;get_random_secret_key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, when the &lt;code&gt;DJANGO_SECRET_KEY&lt;/code&gt; environment variable is set, our application will use it. If no value is provided, the &lt;code&gt;get_random_secret_key()&lt;/code&gt; function is called and will return a random secret key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default, the Django application runs in &lt;code&gt;DEBUG&lt;/code&gt;. When deploying the application in production, for security and performance purposes &lt;code&gt;DEBUG&lt;/code&gt; mode needs to be disabled. We will change the default value to disable DEBUG until it is explicitly enabled via the environment variable &lt;code&gt;DJANGO_DEBUG=True&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;DEBUG&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;environ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'DJANGO_DEBUG'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'False'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'True'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, update the &lt;code&gt;ALLOWED_HOSTS&lt;/code&gt; directive to read the &lt;code&gt;DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS&lt;/code&gt; from the environment. &lt;code&gt;ALLOWED_HOSTS&lt;/code&gt; is required to contain the list of strings representing the host/domain names that the Django application can serve.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ALLOWED_HOSTS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getenv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"localhost,127.0.0.1"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;","&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last, go to the bottom of the file and add the following directive below &lt;code&gt;STATIC_URL&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;STATIC_URL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'/static/'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;STATIC_ROOT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;BASE_DIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"staticfiles"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This setting is used to set the directory from which we want to serve static files.&lt;br&gt;
The first part of the Django configuration is done, we can move to the next step and configure Django to use a PlanetScale database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#configure-django-to-use-a-planetscale-database"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Configure Django to use a PlanetScale database
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use a PlanetScale database in our Django application, create a new database&lt;br&gt;
from the PlanetScale &lt;a href="https://app.planetscale.com/"&gt;control panel&lt;/a&gt; or using the&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/planetscale/cli#installation"&gt;CLI&lt;/a&gt; running:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pscale database create django-on-koyeb
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once the database is created, create a new database password for the main branch. On the PlanetScale control panel, click the &lt;strong&gt;Connect&lt;/strong&gt; button and new password to generate a user and password to connect the database.&lt;br&gt;
You can also perform this action using the PlanetScale CLI by running:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pscale password create django-on-koyeb main production-password
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Keep these credentials in a safe place, we will need them when deploying our application on Koyeb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On PlanetScale, the main database's schema is immutable and all changes must occur on a development branch. As we will need to perform a migration propagate our models into our PlanetScale database,&lt;br&gt;
we need to create a new branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the PlanetScale control panel, click the &lt;strong&gt;New branch&lt;/strong&gt; button and name the branch migration. You can also perform this operation using the PlanetScale CLI running:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pscale branch create django-on-koyeb migration
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once the branch is created, create a new database password to access the branch. On the PlanetScale control panel, click the &lt;strong&gt;Connect&lt;/strong&gt; button and new password to generate a user and password to connect the database.&lt;br&gt;
You can also perform this action using the PlanetScale CLI by running:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pscale password create django-on-koyeb migration migration-branch-password
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As PlanetScale uses Vitess behind the scenes, we need to use a custom database engine to make our Django application work with Vitess.&lt;br&gt;
To retrieve the Vitess custom engine, clone the Vitess repository and copy the &lt;code&gt;custom_db_backends&lt;/code&gt; directory in your Django application root folder:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/vitessio/vitess.git ~/vitess
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-r&lt;/span&gt; ~/vitess/support/django/custom_db_backends ./
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, open the Django application &lt;code&gt;settings.py&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;nano django_on_koyeb/settings.py
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By default, Django is using an SQLite database, we need to edit the&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;settings.py&lt;/code&gt; to use a Vitess database and retrieve the configuration via the &lt;code&gt;DJANGO_DATABASE_URL&lt;/code&gt; environment variable.&lt;br&gt;
If the &lt;code&gt;DJANGO_DATABASE_URL&lt;/code&gt; is not set, the application will raise the exception &lt;code&gt;DJANGO_DATABASE_URL environment variable not defined&lt;/code&gt; when starting.&lt;br&gt;
In the &lt;code&gt;settings.py&lt;/code&gt; replace the following part:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# DATABASES = {
#     'default': {
#         'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
#         'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
#     }
# }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getenv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"DJANGO_DATABASE_URL"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"DJANGO_DATABASE_URL environment variable not defined"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;DB_PARAMS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dj_database_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;environ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"DJANGO_DATABASE_URL"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;DB_PARAMS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"ENGINE"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"custom_db_backends.vitess"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;DATABASES&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;"default"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;DB_PARAMS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's not forget to import the &lt;code&gt;dj_database_url&lt;/code&gt; module we're using:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;django.core.management.utils&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;get_random_secret_key&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;dj_database_url&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pathlib&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Path&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can now save and close the &lt;code&gt;settings.py&lt;/code&gt;. Let's run Django migration to propagate the application models to the PlanetScale database. In the terminal run the following command:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;DJANGO_DATABASE_URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;mysql://PS_USERNAME:PS_PASSWORD@PS_HOST:3306 python manage.py migrate
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Replace the &lt;code&gt;PS_USERNAME&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PS_PASSWORD&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PS_HOST&lt;/code&gt; values with the PlanetScale values you generated for the &lt;code&gt;migration&lt;/code&gt; branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then on the PlanetScale control panel, create a new &lt;strong&gt;Deploy request&lt;/strong&gt; to propagate the schema changes performed on the &lt;code&gt;migration&lt;/code&gt; branch to the production branch &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; and deploy it. You can also perform this operation using the PlanetScale CLI by running:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pscale deploy-request create django-on-koyeb migration
pscale deploy-request deploy django-on-koyeb 1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The application is now configured and ready to be deployed on Koyeb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#deploy-the-django-application-on-koyeb"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Deploy the Django application on Koyeb
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Django application will be deployed on Koyeb using Git, we need to initialize a new git directory for our Django project.&lt;br&gt;
In your terminal run:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git init
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To keep only necessary files in our repository, we will add a &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt; file to exclude undesired files.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/master/Python.gitignore &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; .gitignore
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, execute the following command to add files to commit to your repository and commit the changes&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git add &lt;span class="nb"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
git commit &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Django app initial commit"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Open a new tab in your browser and go to &lt;a href="https://github.com/"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. Create a new repository named &lt;code&gt;django-on-koyeb&lt;/code&gt; and click the &lt;strong&gt;Create repository&lt;/strong&gt; button.&lt;br&gt;
Then, go back to your terminal and add GitHub as a remote repository by running:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/django-on-koyeb.git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rename the repository default branch to main executing:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git branch &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-M&lt;/span&gt; main
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last, push your changes to the GitHub repository by running:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git push &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-u&lt;/span&gt; origin main
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Everything is now ready to deploy the Django application on Koyeb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to the Koyeb &lt;a href="https://app.koyeb.com"&gt;control panel&lt;/a&gt; and click the &lt;strong&gt;Create App&lt;/strong&gt; button.&lt;br&gt;
Choose GitHub as a deployment method and choose the repository you previously created in the list and set &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; as the branch value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Override the default &lt;strong&gt;Run command&lt;/strong&gt; with the following value to get the application to run properly: &lt;code&gt;gunicorn --worker-tmp-dir /dev/shm django_on_koyeb.wsgi&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, in the &lt;strong&gt;Ports&lt;/strong&gt; section change the default port from 80 to 8000 which is the default port our application is listening to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;Environment variables&lt;/strong&gt; section:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add an environment variable of type &lt;strong&gt;Secret&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;code&gt;DJANGO_DATABASE_URL&lt;/code&gt; as the value and in the value section click &lt;strong&gt;Create Secret&lt;/strong&gt; and name your Secret &lt;code&gt;django-db-url&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;mysql://PS_USERNAME:PS_PASSWORD@PS_HOST:3306&lt;/code&gt; as value. Take care to replace PS_USERNAME, PS_PASSWORD, and PS_HOST with the PlanetScale password information you created for your main production branch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a plaintext environment variable with the name &lt;code&gt;DJANGO_DEBUG&lt;/code&gt; and value set to &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt;. We need this to validate our application is running properly as it doesn't contain any routes at the moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a plaintext environment variable with the name &lt;code&gt;DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS&lt;/code&gt;
and value set to &lt;code&gt;django-on-koyeb-&amp;lt;KOYEB-ORG&amp;gt;.koyeb.app&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give your App a name, for instance &lt;code&gt;django-on-koyeb&lt;/code&gt; and click the &lt;strong&gt;Create App&lt;/strong&gt; button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your application is now being built and deployed on the Koyeb serverless platform. Within a few minutes, you will be able to access your application by clicking your App URL: &lt;code&gt;https://django-on-koyeb-&amp;lt;KOYEB-ORG&amp;gt;.koyeb.app&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this guide, we explained how to deploy a Django application on the Koyeb serverless platform with PlanetScale as the database backend for our application.&lt;br&gt;
By deploying on Koyeb, your Django application is secured with native TLS encryption and benefits from all the Koyeb serverless features including autoscaling, auto-healing, and a high-performance edge network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the git-driven deployment feature offered by Koyeb, each time you push new modifications to your GitHub repository, a new deployment of your application occurs automatically.&lt;br&gt;
This allows you to focus on your application code while Koyeb takes care of building, deploying your application, and ensure your service is always up and running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or suggestions to improve this guide,&lt;br&gt;
feel free to reach out to us on &lt;a href="https://slack.koyeb.com"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What does CRUD stand for in programming</title>
      <author>Coderslang: Become a Software Engineer</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 07:11:37 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/coderslang/what-does-crud-stand-for-in-programming-4kj1</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/coderslang/what-does-crud-stand-for-in-programming-4kj1</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;CRUD stands for &lt;strong&gt;Create, Read, Update, and Delete&lt;/strong&gt;. CRUD is the basic operations of the database management system (DBMS), and is used when you want to create, view, edit, or remove the data inside the application's database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any organization and application software that needs to store information like user account information, shop items, payments, etc., will often keep them in a database. And to manage these databases, you will need CRUD operations to perform the functions of creating, updating, and removing the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A programmer can change these data through writing code, or a user through interacting with graphical user interfaces (GUI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-crud-exactly-works"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How CRUD exactly works
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get an idea of how CRUD works, let's pretend that you are managing an e-commerce website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-create"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Create
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you got a new product from the supplier and want to list it on your website, so your customers can see the product and buy it, you use the Create operation. The Create operation allows you to add new data to the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-read"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Read
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are looking for a specific product and use the search bar to find the product, you are using the Read operation. The Read operation allows you to search and retrieve the data that you have created in the database. It won't modify the data or alter it in other ways - you can only read the data, and that's about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-update"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Update
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you spot a typo in one of the product names and want to edit it before the customer sees your mistake, you use the Update operation. The Update operation allows you to change the existing data that you have created in the database. You also use the update operation when you want to add more information to the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-delete"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Delete
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you want to remove the product from your website because the manufacturer has stopped producing it, and it's no longer available in the market, you use the Delete operation. The Delete operation allows you to remove the data from the database that you don't need anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-crud-is-important"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why CRUD is important
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CRUD concept may be simple enough, but all the world's most popular applications follow the CRUD pattern when you think about it. Google, Windows Office, Facebook, PayPal, Amazon, Uber, and others used CRUD as a model to build the application. Without the CRUD operations, it will be impossible to make these applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CRUD is very important because it helps you think about how to design an application that relies on user's data. If you understand the CRUD concept and can create, view, modify and remove the data from the database, you can virtually create any application you can imagine.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shorten Your CSS Selectors With The :is Pseudo-Class</title>
      <author>Nathan</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 06:41:27 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/natclark/shorten-your-css-selectors-with-the-is-pseudo-class-ig4</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/natclark/shorten-your-css-selectors-with-the-is-pseudo-class-ig4</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One CSS feature I wish I knew about long before I discovered it is the &lt;code&gt;:is&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes"&gt;pseudo-class&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use it to shorten some of your longer selectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, consider the following declaration block:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;h4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;h5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;h6&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* some styles would go here */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Seems a bit repetitive, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, here's how our code would expand if we wanted to add a class to each &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;h4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;h5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;h5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* some styles would go here */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We'd have to re-type "&lt;code&gt;.class&lt;/code&gt;" &lt;em&gt;six times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is just one small example of how the &lt;code&gt;:is&lt;/code&gt; selector can save you some keystrokes:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;h4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;h5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;h6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* some styles would go here */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this case, if we wanted to add that same class from earlier, we'd just have to type it once, instead of six times:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;h4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;h5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;h6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* some styles would go here */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So basically, all it does is iterate over each comma-separated internal selector and apply it to the sibling or child selector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#performance-implications"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Performance implications
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One important thing to remember about CSS is that subtle differences in selector syntax can carry exponential impact on performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, "&lt;code&gt;div &amp;gt; p&lt;/code&gt;" is far less performant than "&lt;code&gt;div p&lt;/code&gt;", because browers interpret selectors from right to left. While this is something I might write about more in the future, it's beyond the scope of this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as far as the &lt;code&gt;:is&lt;/code&gt; selector goes, I just want to note that pseudo-classes (including &lt;code&gt;:is&lt;/code&gt;) are the &lt;a href="https://csswizardry.com/2011/09/writing-efficient-css-selectors/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; inefficient selector type&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the &lt;a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=%3Ais"&gt;browser compatibility&lt;/a&gt; could be improved. I'd strongly suggest looking into some backwards-compatible pseudo-classes with the same functionality, such as "&lt;code&gt;:matches()&lt;/code&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed this article, and I hope it saves you some time in the future!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, who wants to sit around and rewrite each selector six times every time there's a small change?&lt;/p&gt;
