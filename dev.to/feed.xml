&lt;p&gt;Hello Devs, if you want to become a certified Azure Professional in 2022 or preparing for AZ-900 or Azure Fundamentals certification but not sure how to approach the exam then you have come to the right place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, I will guide you about AZ-900 exam and share topics, tips, resources, books, online courses you can take to prepare well for this exam and become a certified Azure professional in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing skills are in demand and companies are increasingly looking for people who know and worked in public cloud platforms like &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/02/top-5-courses-to-crack-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-exam-certification-clf-c01.html"&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/02/top-5-courses-to-crack-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-exam-certification-clf-c01.html"&gt;GCP&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/02/top-5-AZ-900-exam-Azure-Fundamentals-certification-practice-tests-and-mock-exams-to.html"&gt;Microsoft Azure&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking to get started in Cloud Computing, particularly on the Microsoft Azure side then AZ-900 or Azure Fundamentals certification is probably the best way to start. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will not only learn about Azure but also learn essential Cloud Computing fundamentals like storage, network, compute, and memory among all things. You will also learn about things like IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service) and SaaS (Software as a Service), Sales, and Pricing, which are very important for both technical and non-technical IT professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier, I have shared a few tips, &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/02/top-5-courses-to-crack-az-900-microsoft-azure-fundamentals-certification-exam.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;courses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.certification-questions.com/practice-exam/microsoft/az-900?affiliateCode=fcff36fd-557a-4713-abf6-973e9924770f&amp;amp;utm_source=Javin&amp;amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;amp;utm_campaign=affiliate"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;practice tests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to prepare for the AZ-900 or Microsoft Azure Fundamentals exam and today, I'll talk about how to crack the Microsoft Azure Fundamental certification (AZ-900) in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, before that, let's first understand what is Microsoft Fundamentals or AZ-900 certification exam?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has established a certification in Azure's new role-based certification path, specifically "Microsoft Certified Azure Fundamentals". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exam is intended for people with non-technical training, as well as technical people who wish to test their basic knowledge of Azure cloud services. To obtain this certification, it is compulsory to pass the AZ-900 exam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Requirements of Microsoft Fundamental Azure AZ-900 Exam
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure AZ-900 is a light exam compared to many other Microsoft role-based exams. This exam does not require experienced cloud professionals or programming assistants. If you are an individual involved in buying and selling cloud services, this review will benefit you even if it comes from a non-technical experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, this exam will be useful for people who want to validate their basic knowledge of cloud services or solutions. Again, it will be helpful if the exam candidate has general computer knowledge or experience before starting formal preparation for the AZ-900 exam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say we want to pursue a career in one of Azure's key roles, including developer, solution architect, administrator, etc. and you don't know where to start your journey. Here come this exam and certification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exam can confirm your mastery of the Azure basics and make you competent enough to undertake future Azure certification activities. This warranty may reflect the results of the test when other preparations for the Microsoft Azure certification exam are also taken.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Basic information of Microsoft Azure-900
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recommend that you know the basic details of this exam before you begin preparing for the AZ-900 exam. Microsoft has a defined policy regarding exams. Here, each type of exam has specific details depending on the role or function. There will be several details for Microsoft MCSA exams, role-based exams, etc. However, let's see how these details apply to our AZ-900 exam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-structure-of-exam"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Structure of Exam
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with most Azure exams, you can expect 40 to 60 questions on an AZ-900 exam and you will get 85 minutes. And there will be a different question format like a case study, a short answer, repeated answer options, a build list, a hotspot, a multiple-choice, a brand review, a review screen, an active screen, better answer, drag, and drop, etc. during your exam You can answer any number of exam questions. There will be no penalty for giving incorrect answers. Just don't check the wrong answers, that's all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-exam-registration-fee"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Exam Registration Fee
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is mandatory to check the exam price before starting preparation for the AZ-900 exam. These exam fees are subject to change depending on where the exam is taken. If you live in the United States, the exam will cost $ 99. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will benefit from a reduced rate if you are a member of the Microsoft Imagine Academy program, a member of the Microsoft Partner Network program, or a Microsoft Certified Trainer. Students are also entitled to a fee reduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-passing-score-of-az900-exam"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Passing Score of AZ-900 Exam
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to get a total of 700 points to pass this exam. The candidate who receives votes below this number will be considered bankrupt. You can find out the results of your exam a few minutes after the end of the exam. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, to get a detailed dashboard, you have to wait a few days. The dashboard can contain many details, including general exam performance, pass / fail status, a bar chart showing performance in key areas of the exam, and instructions on how to interpret. The results of your exam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-exam-retake-policy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. Exam Retake Policy
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many candidates expressed doubts about the exam repetition policies before starting preparation for the AZ-900 exam or during preparation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are trying this exam and cannot pass it for the first time, you must wait at least 24 hours before repeating the exam. If this happens to you a second time, the waiting time for the next exam can be increased to 14 days. This way you can take a maximum of 5 reps in a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#7-policies-for-cancelling-the-exam"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  7. Policies for Cancelling the Exam
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you cancel or reschedule an appointment at least 6 working days before the exam, the cancellation will not be invoiced. If the cancellation/rescheduling takes place within 5 working days, you will be charged a small fee. However, if you do not reschedule/cancel the appointment within 24 hours or if you cannot participate in the exam, all exam fees will be forfeited.&lt;/p&gt;

  3. Books and Reading Material
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a reliable Azure book, your impact would be very high in preparing for the AZ-900 exam. But unfortunately, most of the Azure books available do not meet the expectations of the necessary readers or meet industry standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we have shared some of the Azure books which can be very helpful in preparing for the AZ-900 exam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Azure-Beginners-Getting-Started/dp/1978385641?tag=javamysqlanta-20"&gt;Microsoft Azure For Beginners: Getting Started with Microsoft Azure:&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-exam-simulator-and-practice-questions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Exam Simulator and Practice Questions
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practice with Simulator is the best way to analyze your skills and abilities in a particular area. You can also find many websites during the AZ-900 exam preparation that claim they can provide the best Simulator for the AZ-900 exam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never trust these websites because they don't provide a real exam environment and valid questions. Sometimes using these simulators can even result in the main exam being failed. Therefore, always keep these difficulties in mind when preparing for the AZ-900 exam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should choose David Mayer &lt;a href="https://www.certification-questions.com/practice-exam/microsoft/az-900?affiliateCode=fcff36fd-557a-4713-abf6-973e9924770f&amp;amp;utm_source=Javin&amp;amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;amp;utm_campaign=affiliate"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Azure Fundamentals AZ-900 Simulator&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; because they are providing a real exam environment and valid questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.certification-questions.com/practice-exam/microsoft/az-900?affiliateCode=fcff36fd-557a-4713-abf6-973e9924770f&amp;amp;utm_source=Javin&amp;amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;amp;utm_campaign=affiliate"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GHQeWTFq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tFkwI6D1qJc/Xt2hmlcVe6I/AAAAAAAAftg/kKlsXL8JDIwnRFY4PfP__o-rTWfuZeidQCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h308/azure-certification-dumps.jpg" alt="best Practice test and mock exam for Microsoft Azure Fundamentals AZ-900 Cloud Certification" width="398" height="308"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, if you like Udemy practice test then also have a AZ-900 practice test on Udemy where I have shared more than &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/az-900-practice-test-azure-fundamentls-certification-exam/?referralCode=C335B28D838A48DEDFA1"&gt;250+ questions&lt;/a&gt; and their explanation topic wise. You can use that practice test to prepare well for AZ-900 exam or test your skill to find gaps in your learning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Faz-900-practice-test-azure-fundamentls-certification-exam%2F%3FreferralCode%3DC335B28D838A48DEDFA1"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8QPXWtI3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0%2AGc8BL_94ZsgQGNaS.png" alt="6 Best AZ-900 Practice Tests, Dumps, and Mock Exams to Crack Azure  Fundamentals Exam " width="735" height="354"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-white-papers-analyst-report-and-ebooks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. White Papers, Analyst Report, and E-books
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This step can always be ignored when preparing for the AZ-900 exam. This is as important as related books or documents because these things are published by Microsoft itself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From these sources, you can find many relevant Azure documents. Also, be sure to subscribe to Azure Notifications to help you stay up to date on the latest Azure updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is one such whitepaper to check with, you can download it from Azure website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/example-azure-implementation-for-government-agencies/"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--poodRbAH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/64041i273C0E708F530193/image-size/large%3Fv%3Dv2%26px%3D999" alt="NEW WHITEPAPER: Example Azure Implementation for Government Agencies -  Microsoft Tech Community" width="465" height="653"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's all about &lt;strong&gt;how to crack Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) Cloud Certification in 2022&lt;/strong&gt;. If you want to start working with Microsoft Azure or any other cloud platform then this is a really good certification to get started. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will not only learn about Microsoft Azure Fundamentals but also Cloud Computing fundamentals which apply to all kinds of cloud providers like &lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/top-10-courses-to-learn-amazon-web-services-aws-cloud-in-2020-best-and-free-317f10d7c21d"&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/07/top-5-google-cloud-platform-gcp-courses-certifications-online.html"&gt;GCP&lt;/a&gt;, and Microsoft Azure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/abstract/a-few-useful-tricks-in-python-for-beginners-1bfa</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone! Let's see together what elegant mechanics professional Python developers use in their code&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I very often see such examples in some public Git repositories of experienced programmers.&lt;br&gt;
Let's get started&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sorting-data-by-multiple-keys"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Sorting data by multiple keys
&lt;/h1&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;peoples&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'name'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'John'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"age"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;64&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'name'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'Janet'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"age"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;34&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'name'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'Ed'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"age"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;24&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'name'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'Sara'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"age"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;64&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'name'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'John'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"age"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'name'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'Jane'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"age"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;34&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'name'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'John'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"age"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;52&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;peoples&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;lambda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'name'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'age'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;people&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#Output
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'name'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'Ed'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="s"&gt;'age'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'name'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'Jane'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'age'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;34&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'name'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'Janet'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'age'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;34&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'name'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'John'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'age'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'name'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'John'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'age'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;52&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'name'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'John'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'age'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;64&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'name'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'Sara'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'age'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;64&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;at the output, we get alphabetical sorting, and if the values match, the sorting takes place by the second key. This will not have an effect if there are no duplicate values in your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#list-comprehensions-list-generator"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  List comprehensions (List Generator)
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have already shown an understanding of the list in my previous articles, here I will just show you a few possible uses&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basic syntax&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;[ expression for item in list if conditions ]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A very simple example to fill in a list is a sequence of numbers:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mylist&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mylist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And since you can use an expression, you can also do some math.:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;squares&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;squares&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#output
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;36&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;49&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;64&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;81&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can call a function as an expression&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;some_function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#output
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;3.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;3.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;4.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;4.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;5.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;5.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;6.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;6.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;7.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And finally, you can use "if" to filter the list. In this case, we only keep the values that are divisible by 2:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filtered&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filtered&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#output
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#control-of-memory-in-use-by-objects"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Control of memory in use by objects
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also already mentioned sys.getsizeof() in the articles, but here I want to show you an interesting example that will show all the usefulness of memory control&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;mylist&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getsizeof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mylist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#output
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;48&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just 48 bytes? Seriously? The list is from 0 to 9999?&lt;br&gt;
Yes, guys and why is this happening, I'll tell you now&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is that range only pretends to be a list, behaves like a list, but in fact, the range function returns a class and it certainly loads less memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For comparison, let's create a real list with the same range&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;myreallist&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getsizeof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;myreallist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#output
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;87616&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Agree, the numbers vary greatly, so it's not so useless to monitor memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dataclasses"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Dataclasses
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since version 3.7, Python offers data classes. There are several advantages over regular classes or other alternatives, such as returning multiple values or dictionaries:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a data class requires a minimal amount of code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that you can compare data classes because there is "__ eq __"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you can easily output a data class for debugging because you can use "__ repr __"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;data classes that require type hints, this reduces the likelihood of errors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of a data class in action:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;dataclasses&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dataclass&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dataclass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;rank&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;suit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="n"&gt;card&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Q"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"hearts"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;card&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# True
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;rank&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 'Q'
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;suit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 'hearts'
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#Card(rank='Q', suit='hearts')
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#finding-the-most-common-value"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Finding the most common value
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fairly simple and elegant example of searching for repetitions in a sequence&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;collections&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Counter&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Counter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'abracadabra'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;most_common&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#output
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'a'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Counter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'abracadabra'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;most_common&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#output
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'a'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'b'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Counter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'abracadabra'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;most_common&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#output
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'a'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'b'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'r'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As an argument for Counter, you can pass, for example, list. This will also work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#merging-dictionaries-python-35"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Merging Dictionaries (Python 3.5+)
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with Python 3.5, it's easier to combine dictionaries:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dict1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'a'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'b'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;dict2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'b'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'c'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;merged&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dict1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dict2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;merged&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#output
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'a'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'b'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'c'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If there are overlapping keys, the keys from the first dictionary will be overwritten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Python 3.9, combining dictionaries becomes even cleaner. The above merge in Python 3.9 can be rewritten as:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dict1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'a'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'b'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;dict2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'b'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'c'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;merged&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dict1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dict2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;merged&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#output
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'a'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'b'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'c'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Conclusion&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of some complex (to learn) mechanics in a programming language seems unnecessary to many novice programmers. &lt;br&gt;
But have you ever wondered why more experienced developers use such mechanisms more often?. Simplicity for a beginner and simplicity for a professional are two completely different things. What seems complicated and cumbersome for a beginner is actually the simplest and lightest solution for a more experienced programmer. Each of you will come to these methods and solutions by yourself. Sooner or later. It's just that in our world today, you can learn everything. Let's learn properly!&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/abstract/simple-commands-in-linux-that-will-make-you-feel-like-a-pro-3nde</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Linux is a very popular and interesting operating system (OS), especially for programmers. The Linux terminal is a very important part of a Linux OS. That means that if you know the basic commands to enter the terminal, you'll be more comfortable and confident in using this OS.&lt;br&gt;
There is so much information about Linux and so many courses. But almost no one can give you a shortlist of the most popular and useful commands except for the already well-known ones like &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt;. I use some of these commands myself, and I can't imagine the programmer's life without them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-touch"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Touch
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Touch is one of the easiest commands that will help you to create a new empty file (you can also create a bunch of files) in the directory that you're currently in.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;touch file.txt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zyAMmHcv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q7bnuvsdbdrzyral98au.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zyAMmHcv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q7bnuvsdbdrzyral98au.png" alt="Image description" width="542" height="296"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-killall"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Killall
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a slow PC or just want to kill all running processes that are interfering with your work, use this command:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;killall Notes
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But you should remember that it deletes any data and won't let any application save it. By default, the killall command is case-sensitive. But you can use the -I option to ignore the case.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;killall -I notes
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-tc"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Tc
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the traffic control command, you can manipulate network traffic inside your Linux OS. A common example where &lt;code&gt;tc&lt;/code&gt; is used is in applying some packet delay to a network connection. With &lt;code&gt;tc&lt;/code&gt; you can manipulate incoming and outgoing packets to apply things like delay or even drop a certain number of them entirely. Let's take a look at a relatively simple example where we apply a delay to our own network connection. That's my ping at Google:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pi@raspberry:~ $ ping 8.8.8.8
PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=117 time=13.6 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=2 ttl=117 time=10.9 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=3 ttl=117 time=15.5 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=4 ttl=117 time=13.8 ms
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's induce 100ms of delay with &lt;code&gt;tc&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo tc qdisc add dev eth0 root netem delay 100mspi@raspberry:~ $ ping 8.8.8.8
PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=117 time=110 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=2 ttl=117 time=116 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=3 ttl=117 time=119 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=4 ttl=117 time=113 ms
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-fc"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Fc
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose you want to edit a really long command that you just fired. Using the terminal will need some effort. The &lt;code&gt;fc&lt;/code&gt; command solves this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the below example, I ran a &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; command that had a typo. So I ran the &lt;code&gt;fc&lt;/code&gt; command. The previous command, &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; , opened in an editor; I fixed the command and saved the file. And the &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; command ran again with the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-whiptail"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Whiptail
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;whiptail&lt;/code&gt; is the command that creates a wonderful pop-up message. This is a handy single-purpose utility for displaying dialog boxes right inside of the terminal.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;whiptail --yesno "Did you already know whiptail?" 40 150
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1I7tuSDe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/56kjh4fa63csqhlu6wae.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1I7tuSDe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/56kjh4fa63csqhlu6wae.png" alt="Image description" width="664" height="429"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;whiptailhas&lt;/code&gt; a wide range of different displays and inputs for you to choose from:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Message boxes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Text input boxes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Password input boxes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes or no choices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checklists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-uname"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. Uname
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;uname&lt;/code&gt; gets the Linux version-related information about the operating system we're currently using. You can use &lt;code&gt;-s&lt;/code&gt; , &lt;code&gt;-r&lt;/code&gt; , &lt;code&gt;-v&lt;/code&gt; , &lt;code&gt;-n&lt;/code&gt; so that the terminal shows you exactly what you were looking for.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;uname -s
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QpaSvV5P--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6t6d96rlz047muc2icv1.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QpaSvV5P--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6t6d96rlz047muc2icv1.jpeg" alt="Image description" width="800" height="450"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#7-shred"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  7. shred
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you usually delete files? Do you use &lt;code&gt;rm&lt;/code&gt;? If there was any sensitive data in that file, you may want to think twice about using &lt;code&gt;rm&lt;/code&gt; for that sort of thing. This is where &lt;code&gt;shred&lt;/code&gt; comes in. This little utility will actually erase a file securely by writing random data over top of the file multiple times.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;shred -u file.txt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#8-ps"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  8. Ps
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ps&lt;/code&gt; displays information about a selection of the active processes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ps -A
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gilouZwR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5xitodlm6n5brh66gmx3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gilouZwR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5xitodlm6n5brh66gmx3.png" alt="Image description" width="582" height="268"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#9-echo"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  9. Echo
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;echo&lt;/code&gt; displays a line of text or whatever you want in your terminal (just like a print function).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;echo -e "Geeks \vfor \vGeeks"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IbiVosAN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7iogwzyqc2upm28sdbao.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IbiVosAN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7iogwzyqc2upm28sdbao.png" alt="Image description" width="730" height="248"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#10-sl"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  10. Sl
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sl&lt;/code&gt; is one of the funniest commands, which is why I saved it for last.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;brew install sl
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You'll get something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fP_dJaw5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vx1bxw2rvflsif8iratf.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fP_dJaw5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vx1bxw2rvflsif8iratf.jpeg" alt="Image description" width="559" height="290"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now type &lt;code&gt;sl -F&lt;/code&gt; and see it fly. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading my article. Linux has a lot of different commands. However, I tried to find the ten best and most handy ones that will make you a pro at using the OS. Hope these commands will make using the OS a more pleasant experience for you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Different ways for User Authentication with NodeJS Part - 2 (JWT)</title>
      <author>Lavish Goyal</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 21 Nov 2021 04:46:47 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/lavig10/different-ways-for-user-authentication-with-nodejs-part-2-jwt-3h0p</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/lavig10/different-ways-for-user-authentication-with-nodejs-part-2-jwt-3h0p</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So this is the part 2 of the User Authentication with NodeJS. You can check out the Part - 1 &lt;a href="https://dev.to/lavig10/different-ways-for-user-authentication-with-nodejs-1odj"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. In this Part we talk about the modern solution for User Authentication which is much more feasible and scalable. Token Based Authentication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#token-based-authentication"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Token Based Authentication
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://postimg.cc/pp98vqvX"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--U4Yw7uZE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.postimg.cc/dt698xSd/Client.png" alt="Client.png" width="880" height="587"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In token based authentication, when a user logins with correct credentials a &lt;em&gt;token&lt;/em&gt; (a long string with random characters and numbers) is generated and sent back to the client's browser where it is stored (in localStorage, SessionStorage or cookie). Now every time a user will make a request to the server that token stored in browser will be sent back to the server and we will have some middleware function to verify the token and give back the required resources.&lt;br&gt;
Let's implement it in code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create an empty NodeJS project and in terminal run the command&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install express jsonwebtoken mongoose&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;express - For creating our server&lt;br&gt;
mongoose - To Connect to our MongoDB Database&lt;br&gt;
jsonwebtoken - Known as JWT, it is an open source npm package for generating access tokens securely&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mongoose&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;mongoose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;jwt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;jsonwebtoken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mongoose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;your_mongo_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;MongoDB Connected....&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;send&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Hello World!&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Server 🔥🔥🔥 up on 5000`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This block of code will make our server up and running on Port 5000. So if you now visit &lt;a href="http://localhost:5000/"&gt;http://localhost:5000/&lt;/a&gt; you will see the desired result.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/login&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;findOne&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Please enter a valid username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;accessToken&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;jwt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sign&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;JWT_SECRET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;expiresIn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;NODE_ENV&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;production&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;6h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;2 days&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;User logged in!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;accessToken&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;503&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Server error!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So above block of code is posting the login credentials and logging in the user. Let us understand the &lt;code&gt;jwt.sign()&lt;/code&gt; functionality which is creating our access token.&lt;br&gt;
JWT - Json Web Token has a method called &lt;code&gt;sign()&lt;/code&gt; which is used to create a new web token which will contain user information in a hidden way. There are three parameters in &lt;code&gt;jwt.sign()&lt;/code&gt; method. Let's talk about each of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;First is the data to be stored in the token. It can be a string or a javascript object. In this example we stored username and id (mongodb unique generated id) in the access token.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second parameter is the &lt;code&gt;JWT_SECRET&lt;/code&gt;. It can be anything (a random string) and it is important not to display it in production. You should use environment variables for saving the JWT_SECRET. It'll be used later on to verify the JWT Token and authenticate the user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third parameter is optional properties that can be defined for the access token, like expiry date, httpOnly etc. You can check out more in detail about the optional parameters &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This function will return us a string of random characters which is called a jwt access token. Something like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpZCI6IjYwZndmNzA5N2ZmN2YwOTdmMDk5IiwidXNlcm5hbWUiOiJsYXZpc2hnb3lhbCJ9.kNPmoyim0KbrHw6Fl2NPdUWO3UdZ1cr3rFH4eZy9DIg&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Now if you how this token contains information about user, open another tab in your browser and go to &lt;a href="https://jwt.io/"&gt;https://jwt.io/&lt;/a&gt; and in the encoded input box paste the above access token and you'll receive the id and username as shown below&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://postimg.cc/309HbgLs"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--E1fFRnOr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.postimg.cc/MXJKH51p/Screenshot-2021-11-21-095657.png" alt="Screenshot-2021-11-21-095657.png" width="880" height="418"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look closely there are two dots in the JWT Access token which divides the token string into three parts.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://postimg.cc/ppXhCvkS"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--J9HkTw76--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.postimg.cc/15DG95Fy/Screenshot-2021-11-21-100033.png" alt="Screenshot-2021-11-21-100033.png" width="572" height="298"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part is the algorithm for encoding the token, second part consists the user details we entered and third part is the JWT Secret used to verify the user later (which we'll do just now)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;authenticateToken&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;authHeader&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;authorization&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;token&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;authHeader&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;authHeader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;token&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;401&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Not Authorized&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;jwt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;verify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;JWT_SECRET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;401&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This block of code will verify the incoming JWT token and authenticate the user and we can proceed with further data processing. &lt;code&gt;jwt.verify()&lt;/code&gt; takes in three parameters, first is the token which we'll receive from client. The token can be received either via cookie or in headers. Here the token is passed in the header &lt;code&gt;Authorization&lt;/code&gt; Header. *&lt;em&gt;Remember the JWT_SECRET should be the same among the whole project otherwise the jwt token will not be decoded and return an error of invalid token. *&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the above authenticateToken middleware function can be used in all the protected routes to verify if the user is eligible for accessing data at that particular route for example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/dashboard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;authenticateToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;send&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Welcome to dashboard&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So in the above code we used the authenticateToken as the middleware function and if the client's request contains a correct jwt token user will be shown Welcome to dashboard heading otherwise will be shown an error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was all folks. That was all about the authentication and authorization with NodeJS. There are much more complex and secure ways to do authentication but it was a beginner's tutorial so I kept it that way. Will cover more about it in next blogs. Until then share the post and tag me on twitter. &lt;br&gt;

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we will learn and use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in javascript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are coming from an Object-Oriented Programming language like C++ or Java, You probably wished to use class-based syntax in javascript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't know about OOP, don't worry I am going to explain you all the concepts with easy to understand examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#nice-to-have"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Nice to have
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the release of ES6, We were using Constructor functions to use the OOP concept. But now with, the help of ES6 Classes, we can have more similar syntax like C++ or Java to use the OOP concept.&lt;br&gt;
(Behind the scene ES6 Classes uses the same constructor functions)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's cool 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what is Object-Oriented Programming? 🤔&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a popular definition of OOP&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Object-Oriented Programming(OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concepts of Objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Means? 🙄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means everything that we achieve in OOP language is through objects here object defines the real-world entities like Student or Car (More detail soon).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok! But why do we need OOP?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good Question!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal of developing OOP was organising the structure of the code. Using OOP, you can write more modular and maintainable code. You can associate the code with real-world entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using OOP, you make sure that only allowed members of one code is accessible to others. That makes your code fully secured to unauthenticated access (within the code).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get it??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, Let's see the main concepts of Object-Oriented Programming step by step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#object"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Object
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I already mentioned above, Objects are like real-life entities. They have their properties and methods. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider a car as an object. The car has so many characteristics like colour, company name, modal name and price, etc. On a car, we can perform actions like start, break, and stop. Here characteristics of a car are properties, and actions are methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are using javascript for a while, you may use objects many times in your code but maybe not in an OOP way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me create one user object here.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Nehal Mahida&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;userName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;nehal_mahida&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;password:)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;login&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;userName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;userName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;userName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Login Successfully&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Authentication Failed!!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;login&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;nehal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;nehal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;login&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;nehal_mahida&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;password:)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Authentication Failed!!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Login Successfully&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The above code is pretty self-explanatory. I am creating one user object having some properties and actions that he can perform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing new, right??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's understand some more OOP concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#class"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Class
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Class is a blueprint of a real-life entity. It describes how the object will look alike, what characteristics it holds and what kind of actions we can perform on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Class is just a template. You can't perform any actions on it. Consider class is your website UX Design(wireframes). You create it to get an idea of how your website UI will look alike at the end. Users can't do interactions with your wireframes as they will do on an actual website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We instantiate the object from a class. We can create many instances of a class. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's take an example.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;userName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;userName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;userName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;login&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;userName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;userName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;userName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Login Successfully&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Authentication Failed!!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setPassword&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;newPassword&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;newPassword&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nehal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Nehal Mahida&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;nehal_mahida&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;password:)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;js&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;JavaScript&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;python:)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nehal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;login&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;nehal_mahida&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;password:)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Login Successfully&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;login&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;python:)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Login Successfully&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nehal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Nehal Mahida&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nehal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// undefined&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nehal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Syntax Error&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nehal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setPassword&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;new_password:)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nehal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;login&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;nehal_mahida&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;password:)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Authentication Failed!!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nehal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;login&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;nehal_mahida&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;new_password:)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Login Successfully&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here I have created a class named &lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt;, which has some properties and methods. Then I am creating instances of the class using &lt;code&gt;new User()&lt;/code&gt; and passing the values of required properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you see one &lt;code&gt;constructor&lt;/code&gt; method which we never called in our code??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, The method has been called 🙄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we create an object from a class using the &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; keyword javascript internally calls the constructor method which initialised the public and private properties of a class. The object here can access all the public properties and methods of a class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;private&lt;/code&gt; properties??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default, all the properties declared in the class are public means you can call and modify them from outside the class. You can declare public properties in or out of the constructor. Here &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;userName&lt;/code&gt; are public properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about private?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again look at the code. Did you notice the password is written outside of the constructor method prefixed with &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hash(&lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;) indicates that this property is private to the class and only methods that are declared inside the class can access it. Private properties should be declared before they were used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I tried to print the password, I got &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; as I don't have any member named as 'password', then I tried it with '#password' that gave me a syntax error because the '#password' is private.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To print/modify the private properties, we need &lt;strong&gt;getter/setter&lt;/strong&gt; methods. Here I have created one method that set the new password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following concepts are the four pillars of OOP langueage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#encapsulation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Encapsulation
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encapsulation&lt;/strong&gt; is defined as binding the data and methods into a single unit to protect it from outside access. Just like a pill contains medication inside of its coating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of class, some properties are not directly accessed from outside of the class. You need to call the responsible method for the properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds familiar?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, You guess it right. It's like creating a &lt;strong&gt;getter/setter&lt;/strong&gt; method for the private properties we declare in a class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above example, we already used encapsulation. We bind(logically) private property &lt;code&gt;password&lt;/code&gt; with a public method &lt;code&gt;setPassword()&lt;/code&gt;. You also have one getter method, which returns the current value of a private property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#abstraction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Abstraction
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People often misunderstood &lt;strong&gt;encapsulation&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;abstraction&lt;/strong&gt;. Abstraction is one step ahead of encapsulation. Abstraction is defined as showing only the essential things and hiding the inner implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's take an example of a car. On a Car, we can perform some actions like start, break and stop. Whenever you call one of these actions, it gives you some result. These actions have certain sub-actions which are hidden from you, but you don't need to care about those sub-actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how car company uses an abstraction of functionality to give their customer a smooth experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's take another example of abstraction. Suppose you are using some third-party react component for your front-end project. This component provides many props and methods for your customisation. This component is no magic it internally uses the same HTML tags, CSS and javascript. But now you don't need to worry about those things. You just need to set props and call methods based on your requirements. That's an abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's code 🤩&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;validateEmail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// check email is valid or not.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;validatePassword&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// check password is satisfying the minimum requirements or not.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nehal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nehal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;signUp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Nehal Mahida&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;nm@gmail.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;password:)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// User registered successfuly&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nehal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;validateEmail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;nm@gmail.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Syntax Error.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nehal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;login&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;nm@gmail.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;password:)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Login Successfully&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nehal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resetPassword&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;nm@gmail.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Operation performed successfully&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the above example, we have introduced some &lt;strong&gt;private&lt;/strong&gt; methods. The methods are doing some work and they are not exposed to the outside of the class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These methods are called by the publically available methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a developer, I just need to give the details I received from the UI and call the responsible method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In OOP languages like &lt;strong&gt;Java&lt;/strong&gt;, we have a concept of &lt;strong&gt;abstract classes&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;interfaces&lt;/strong&gt;. That's not possible in javascript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, we can create one abstract class and that class can be used by another class to achieve similar functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So basically we can say we are using encapsulation to achieve abstraction. 😊&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#inheritance"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Inheritance
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When one class derived the properties and methods of another class it is called &lt;strong&gt;inheritance&lt;/strong&gt; in OOP. The class that inherits the property is known as &lt;strong&gt;subclass&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;child class&lt;/strong&gt; and the class whose properties are inherited is known as a &lt;strong&gt;superclass&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;parent class&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do we need inheritance?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inheritance is a very important concept in OOP. The main advantage of inheritance is &lt;strong&gt;reusability&lt;/strong&gt;. When a child class inherits from parent class we don't need to write the same code again. It becomes very reliable when we need to do some change in properties just change it in a parent class and all the child classes will automatically inherit the change. Inheritance also promotes code &lt;strong&gt;readability&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's code...&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;login&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Login Successfully&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nehal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Author&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;nm@gmail.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;password:)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

Don&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;t forget to leave your feedback. :)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nehal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;I am tired, Do you wanna buy me a coffee? :)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Admin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;jason@gmail.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;[Object] [object]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;login&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;jason@gmail.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;[Object] [object]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resetPassword&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;{id: 1}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;login&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;jason@gmail.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;{id: 1}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;removeUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the above example, the &lt;code&gt;Author&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Admin&lt;/code&gt; classes inherit the property of the &lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt; class using &lt;code&gt;extends&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;super&lt;/code&gt; keywords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;extends&lt;/code&gt; keyword is used to establish a parent-child relationship between two classes. In the first case, the &lt;code&gt;Author&lt;/code&gt; becomes sub-class and the &lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt; becomes parent class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sub-class has access to all the public and protected members of a superclass. In addition, It can have its own properties and methods. This is how we can achieve &lt;strong&gt;reusability&lt;/strong&gt; through inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;super&lt;/code&gt; keyword is a special keyword. Calling &lt;code&gt;super&lt;/code&gt; in the child's constructor invokes the parent constructor. That's how we are initialising the properties in the &lt;code&gt;Author&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Admin&lt;/code&gt; classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The child class can also override the methods of a parent class. This introduces the concept of &lt;strong&gt;polymorphism&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#polymorphism"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Polymorphism
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polymorphism means 'more than one form'. Like us, We the software engineers can work on the frontend, backend, DevOps and even testing. 😅&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polymorphism has two types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compile time Polymorphism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Runtime Polymorphism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Function overloading&lt;/strong&gt; is a type of compile-time polymorphism. Here, we are creating more than one function with the same name and different parameters or types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Function overloading is not supported in JavaScript because if you create functions with the same name, Javascript will override the last defined function with former functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method overriding&lt;/strong&gt; is a type of runtime polymorphism. Remember I told you that you can override the methods of parent class in the child class? That is method overriding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's take example.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;login&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Login Successfully&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Authentication Failed!!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Author&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;numOfPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// add content to your DB. :)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;numOfPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getNumOfPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;numOfPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;login&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// add extra layer of security as this is an admin account.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;isValidAdmin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// we can have some 2FA type security check here.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;isValidAdmin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Authentication Failed!!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;removeUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;userId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// remove this userId from your DB.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;User Removed successfully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nehal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Author&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;nm@gmail.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;password:)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nehal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;login&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;nm@gmail.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;password:)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Login Successfully&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Admin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;jason@gmail.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;[Object] [object]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;login&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;jason@gmail.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;[Object] [object]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Admin Login Successfully&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here, the &lt;code&gt;Author&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Admin&lt;/code&gt; both inherit the &lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt; class. Both classes have the &lt;code&gt;login&lt;/code&gt; method of the User class. Now I need some extra level of verification for the admin account, so I have created a login method in the Admin class. It will override the parent's &lt;code&gt;login&lt;/code&gt; method. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When an object of the &lt;code&gt;Admin&lt;/code&gt; class calls the &lt;code&gt;login&lt;/code&gt; method, it will invoke a function call to the &lt;code&gt;login&lt;/code&gt; method of the &lt;code&gt;Admin&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how we have achieved polymorphism using method overriding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it. We have covered all the concepts of OOP with JavaScript. 🤩&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>5 Effective ways to Grab Users' Attention</title>
      <author>Tapajyoti Bose</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 21 Nov 2021 04:33:55 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/ruppysuppy/5-effective-ways-to-grab-users-attention-3m1m</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the saying goes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where attention goes, money follows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is of &lt;em&gt;utmost importance&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;effectively grab the user's attention&lt;/em&gt; so that they have an &lt;strong&gt;incredible experience&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;using your application&lt;/em&gt;, and you too can &lt;em&gt;generate the revenue you deserve&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we are going to look at &lt;strong&gt;five methods&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;em&gt;effectively grab a user's attention&lt;/em&gt; which will &lt;em&gt;lead to higher engagement with your audience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#scroll-effects"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Scroll Effects
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wc9Rv-M_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2wfpoy693ulfoz0db12u.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wc9Rv-M_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2wfpoy693ulfoz0db12u.gif" alt="Scroll Effect" width="800" height="450"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding &lt;strong&gt;Scroll Effects&lt;/strong&gt; to your project is quite simple, yet it can &lt;em&gt;yield huge dividends&lt;/em&gt;. Smooth scroll animation can hook users easily. The animation shown in the image above can be created by following along this &lt;a href="https://dev.to/ruppysuppy/create-the-ultimate-user-experience-with-aos-animate-on-scroll-39jp"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;em&gt;wonderful scroll animation&lt;/em&gt; can be achieved using &lt;strong&gt;Parallax Effect&lt;/strong&gt; as can be seen below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NVn_S5WF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zmx9swyj1f54h6gvvhg4.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NVn_S5WF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zmx9swyj1f54h6gvvhg4.gif" alt="Parallax Scroll" width="880" height="494"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#say-goodbye-to-long-texts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Say Goodbye to Long Texts
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the advent of technology, there has been a &lt;em&gt;steady decline in our attention spans&lt;/em&gt;. We live in a time of &lt;strong&gt;instant gratification&lt;/strong&gt;, so reading long text is &lt;em&gt;downright boooooooring&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Fqt8YzQL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/40tcq15je698yq36mn8a.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Fqt8YzQL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/40tcq15je698yq36mn8a.png" alt="Long Lines" width="880" height="442"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using a product, users aren't immersed in the &lt;strong&gt;UI&lt;/strong&gt; itself but &lt;em&gt;the experience of using the &lt;strong&gt;UI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Consequently, &lt;em&gt;users don't read &lt;strong&gt;UI&lt;/strong&gt; text — they just scan it&lt;/em&gt;. Help them scan the text faster by writing it in &lt;em&gt;short, scannable blocks&lt;/em&gt;. Chunk text into &lt;strong&gt;shorter sentence&lt;/strong&gt;s and &lt;strong&gt;paragraphs&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Keep the most important text upfront&lt;/strong&gt; and then &lt;em&gt;ruthlessly edit what comes after it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#hover-effects"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Hover Effects
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yZEjZmA---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pjeosdyrzbf1gbrh459z.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yZEjZmA---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pjeosdyrzbf1gbrh459z.gif" alt="Hover Effect" width="800" height="450"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hover is possibly the &lt;em&gt;simplest to implement the effect&lt;/em&gt;. You can &lt;em&gt;create cool hover effects just by using &lt;strong&gt;CSS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;some advanced effects with a little help from &lt;strong&gt;JavaScript&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--O5qx1Hge--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pgfmzu8mg2g3ci6ry261.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--O5qx1Hge--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pgfmzu8mg2g3ci6ry261.gif" alt="Parallax Hover" width="600" height="338"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also opt to use &lt;strong&gt;Parallax Animation&lt;/strong&gt; combined with Hover Effect too, to create some really cool effects that &lt;em&gt;users find enticing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#effective-use-of-white-space"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Effective use of white space
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;White Space&lt;/strong&gt; is one of the most important aspects of a website. Its major use lies in &lt;strong&gt;improving readability&lt;/strong&gt;, but since we are focusing on &lt;em&gt;grabbing the user's attention&lt;/em&gt;, let's not get deviated from our objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;White space&lt;/strong&gt; is can create a &lt;strong&gt;Visual Hierarchy&lt;/strong&gt;, thus telling users where to look at. Let's take the example of &lt;strong&gt;Google&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xilNCRsQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cs67g8jnlm3ydgyw2p44.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xilNCRsQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cs67g8jnlm3ydgyw2p44.png" alt="Google" width="700" height="310"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the &lt;strong&gt;search bar&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; the &lt;strong&gt;logo&lt;/strong&gt; at the center is surrounded by white space, our eyes are by default are &lt;em&gt;drawn to where the developers want our eyes to be&lt;/em&gt;, i.e., &lt;strong&gt;the center&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#smooth-loading"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Smooth Loading
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perception of the speed of the website is based on &lt;strong&gt;load time&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;smoothness of animations&lt;/strong&gt;. What matters the most to users is that &lt;strong&gt;your website feels fast&lt;/strong&gt; (even if it is just their perception).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned previously about &lt;strong&gt;dwindling attention spans&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;delays longer than a couple of seconds will often make users leave the website&lt;/em&gt;, so make sure that your website loads fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can buy yourself a few more seconds by using &lt;strong&gt;smooth&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;captivating loading animations&lt;/strong&gt; like these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sm7uEHM7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/keueg7rt7fyz1p0i6wka.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sm7uEHM7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/keueg7rt7fyz1p0i6wka.gif" alt="Loading Animation" width="800" height="600"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#wrapping-up"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Wrapping Up
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we went through &lt;strong&gt;five ways&lt;/strong&gt; to grab a user's attention. Use them in your applications and watch your &lt;em&gt;users coming back again and again&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UF89vQKc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7chmw84r019x5te0jin8.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UF89vQKc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7chmw84r019x5te0jin8.jpg" alt="Hooked" width="600" height="380"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Happy Developing!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Self-Taught Developer Journey, Day 1</title>
      <author>Jennifer Tieu</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 21 Nov 2021 04:18:43 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/jennifer_tieu/self-taught-developer-journey-day-1-2en1</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/jennifer_tieu/self-taught-developer-journey-day-1-2en1</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I learned....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-start-building-a-website"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to start building a website
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had my first experience pair programming today! My friend, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dwayne_devs"&gt;Dwayne&lt;/a&gt;, walked me through making my first website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We created a navigation bar and hero section. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://mbcreative.ca/blog/15-hero-section-design-inspiration/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"A hero section is a full screen section typically consisting of a background image, or video, or illustrations, or animations, with text and sometimes a call to action.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also learned about CSS pseudo-classes. I added the ":hover" keyword to my navigation bar links to change the button color whenever the mouse hovers over them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s)."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#to-not-underestimate-myself"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  To not underestimate myself
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am halfway through the first chapter The C Programming Language. I discovered I retained a lot more than I thought from when I learned about C in CS50. I am going to keep reading through to see if there's any gaps I might be missing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#its-okay-to-feel-lost"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  It's okay to feel lost
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I definitely still felt lost about what I am doing. After some reassurance from a fellow self-taught developer on Twitter, I was able to snap myself out of it. I am planning to join &lt;a href="https://virtualcoffee.io/"&gt;Virtual Coffee&lt;/a&gt; and attend my first meet up next Thursday afternoon. I am hoping that joining a community will give me the support I need to make it through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please refer to &lt;a href="https://dev.to/jennifer_tieu/starting-my-self-taught-developer-journey-2dga"&gt;Starting My Self-Taught Developer Journey&lt;/a&gt; for context.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Singleton Design Pattern in PHP</title>
      <author>Maniruzzaman Akash</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 21 Nov 2021 04:18:28 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/maniruzzamanakash/singleton-design-pattern-in-php-3o1m</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/maniruzzamanakash/singleton-design-pattern-in-php-3o1m</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Singleton Design Pattern&lt;/code&gt; is a creational design pattern for Object Oriented Programming. &lt;br&gt;
Singleton Pattern ensures that only one object of that class exists and provides a single point of access to it for any other code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these scenerios, we need a Singleton class instance - &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we don't want to recreat any object second time, then we need to use a way like Singleton.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there is a possibility of Memory optimization and one specific class must call one time, then we use singleton pattern.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a Singleton instance is very simple -&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;SingletonPatternExample&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * Singleton Instance
     *
     * @var SingletonPatternExample
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * Private Constructor
     *
     * We can't use the constructor to create an instance of the class
     *
     * @return void
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;__construct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Don't do anything, we don't want to be initialized&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * Get the singleton instance
     *
     * @return SingletonPatternExample
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;getInstance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;isset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$instance&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, we can use this like -&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// We have to call getInstance() static method&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$singletonPattern&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;SingletonPatternExample&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;getInstance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Call our doSomething() method.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$singletonPattern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;doSomething&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can't call Singleton like this -&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$singletonPattern&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;SingletonPatternExample&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It will throw an exception.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Day 43 of 100 Days of Code &amp; Scrum: Sixth Weekly Retrospective</title>
      <author>Rammina</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/rammina/day-43-of-100-days-of-code-scrum-sixth-weekly-retrospective-4k34</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy weekend, everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...I still don't have my Internet back. However, I finished most of the single page skeleton of my company website, and I still made decent progress despite these impediments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It definitely felt like a frustratingly slow burn. Troubleshooting issues was annoying because I had to wait for my Mobile data (which is horrible where I live) to load a page. Looking for images took me a lot longer than it would normally when I had my DSL working. There was even a point where my connection had DNS issues for 2 days, and I could only load Discord and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will admit that I've been pretty demotivated to work lately because I didn't feel like I'm in control of my daily routine. Thankfully, this challenge and the people who gave their support held me accountable. I couldn't just give up knowing that there are those who expect me to do my part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you all for continuing to support me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to my wife and editor, May for editing images and posting the blog on my behalf. Also, thanks for deciphering text messages and turning them into cover images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's move on to my weekly retrospective!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#weekly-sprint-goals"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Weekly Sprint Goals
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;build my company website (and avoid getting distracted by more interesting projects).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continue to learn Next.js.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;go through the Typescript documentation at least 30 minutes each day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continue studying for Professional Scrum Master I (PSM I) certification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continue networking, but allocate less time to this (coding is more important).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#weekly-review"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Weekly Review
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the things I've managed to do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;company homepage has most of the skeleton layout done (only missing styling and functionality).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I connected the AWS SES, Lambda, and API Gateway services together (only needs to connect to the frontend now).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I studied Typescript for a few days in the week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continued to network and expand my connections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's no surprise that I wasn't able the fulfill many of my goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#weekly-retrospective"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Weekly Retrospective
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving on, let's tackle what I've managed to do well, what my shortcomings are, and what I could do better next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-went-great"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What Went Great
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I managed to finish a decent portion of the homepage for my website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learned more about implementing contact e-mails through AWS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;expanded my network a little bit more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#some-mistakes-ive-made"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Some Mistakes I've Made
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn't follow through with studying Typescript every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;barely learned new things about Next.js.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;didn't study Scrum enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I kind of let my lack of motivation drag me down to much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#things-i-could-improve-on"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Things I Could Improve On
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make a schedule to do my daily learnings, so I don't have to think about it too much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have learning resources already opened, so I don't have to spend much energy opening them or looking for them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;commit to my goals more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prioritize tasks that are more likely to help me meet my weekly goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have some backup in case I have Internet outage, that way I don't lose too much productivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I should DEFINITELY install something that blocks me from checking certain sites at a specific time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#resourcesrecommended-readings"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Resources/Recommended Readings
&lt;/h3&gt;

  Tailwind CSS color matcher
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;put your Hex Code and edit the ranges to find the closes match to your color from the tailwind CSS color pallet,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bvOybou_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/eblfikexqggl5c1x5vyx.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bvOybou_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/eblfikexqggl5c1x5vyx.png" alt="Screen Shot" width="880" height="356"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm using the HSL value to compare and find the best match for the color  that you want to find. &lt;br&gt;
The Background of the result section will use the input value as color, this will help you compare visually to see the best match&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How is new() different in Go?</title>
      <author>BhanuReddy</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 21 Nov 2021 03:45:13 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/bhanu011/how-is-new-different-in-go-41lk</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/bhanu011/how-is-new-different-in-go-41lk</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-new"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  what is new()?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;new() is a builtin function, used to create zero values(doesn't initializes memory) and returns pointer. new() can be used to declare any data type. In other words it returns a pointer to a newly allocated zero value of type T. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-make"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  what is make()?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;make() is a builtin function, used to create non zero value and it does not return pointer. It is used to create only map, slice and channels data types. Using make() we can also define length, capacity for slice, initial capacity for map and buffer length for channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0VTcr0cm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1y5k7jkv88ij2x6vvspd.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0VTcr0cm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1y5k7jkv88ij2x6vvspd.jpg" alt="Image description" width="500" height="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#can-we-create-map-slices-and-channels-with-new-function"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Can we create map, slices and channels with new function?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;what is the distinction with these 3 data types? Because these three data types under the covers refers to data structures which has to be initialized before use. For maps, slices and channels make initializes the internal data structure and prepares the value.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can create zero valued types, but even without using new() function same functionality can be achieved below are the examples&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;new(map) is similar to &lt;code&gt;var m map[string]int&lt;/code&gt; and returning pointer to m. Here is the example since map behaves like empty while reading and nil during writing we see errors when write to a map happens before allocating memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://play.golang.org/p/AvIndq1Q7L8"&gt;creating map reference using new function&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;new(slice) creates a slice with zero value and returns pointer. In below example, append function checks size and capacity of slice and manages backing array before appending value. see the example below it looks like new() has initialized memory but that is actually done by append()&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://play.golang.org/p/IxfmM7WSR1x"&gt;creating slices using new function&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;new(chan type) creates a channel with zero value that is a nil channel. Try running below example to see what happens when a value is sent to channel created with new() function.&lt;br&gt;
Expect some errors!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://play.golang.org/p/Gx2fBYURPXQ"&gt;create channel with new function&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-the-specific-problem-new-is-trying-to-solve"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is the specific problem new is trying to solve?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What ever new() function is doing can be achieved by initializing a data type and getting a pointer that data type. In below example both n and n1 looks same and n1 is much more readable and highlights that it is pointer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;`&lt;br&gt;
type Name struct {&lt;br&gt;
    FirstName string&lt;br&gt;
    LastNamae string&lt;br&gt;
}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;func main() {&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;n := new(Name)
n1 := &amp;amp;Name{}

fmt.Printf("Name: %v \n Name1: %v", n, n1)  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;}&lt;br&gt;
`&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;new() in golang is different to new() in other programming languages always remember that new() in Go doesn't initialize memory but it only zeroes the value and return the pointer. To understand this better let us look at below example&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
var x *int&lt;br&gt;
y := new(int)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
What is the difference in above statements? first statement states that x can hold a pointer to integer data type. Second statement tells that zeroed value for int is set and pointer to that is returned. Run below example to understand&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://play.golang.org/p/kBHZtRF4qB3"&gt;How is new() different? Playground Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;new() is different to make() and even without using new() zero valued initialization can be done. May be it is idiomatic way to use new() but other wise I don't see any specific use case which new() is solving. If you see any use case where only new() is able to solve please drop it in comments. Let me know what you think about the post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#references"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  References
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/g/golang-nuts/c/kWXYU95XN04"&gt;discussion on new and make can be merged into one&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to build a Carousel from scratch</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/coderjay06/how-to-build-a-carousel-from-scratch-531c</guid>
      <description>&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#featuring-javascript-html-and-css"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Featuring JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9E-EjHET--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1%2AlvgQkkny9aA3RLSAWBSi5w.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9E-EjHET--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1%2AlvgQkkny9aA3RLSAWBSi5w.png" alt="Carousel" width="623" height="498"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-a-carousel"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is a Carousel?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Web Development, a carousel is a feature that displays a collection of different items (usually images) in a slideshow-like manner. They usually include a couple of arrow buttons that control back and forth navigation through this collection. When the end of the collection or last item is reached it circles back around to the beginning, hence the term carousel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some common use cases are image galleries, news headlines, or featured articles on the homepage of a website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#thinking-about-how-to-build-a-carousel"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Thinking about how to build a Carousel
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin building a carousel we should first start thinking about what we want our carousel to look like and what are the main features it will need. Some of the main points to think about are the following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The basic HTML structure needed to build off of&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including previous and next buttons for navigation (arrow buttons)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the types of items we’ll be including as our slides? (zombie images in this case)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Displaying which slide the user is currently on (filled in dots)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Functionality for changing to the next or previous slide (Javascript)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Styling of our carousel (CSS)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accessibility of our carousel (Use aria labels )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, we can begin building out our carousel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#building-a-carousel"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Building a Carousel
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start building out the structure for our carousel we’ll use several HTML divs so we can position it how we need it to be displayed. The first div will be the container to hold all of the items and features. Each item and feature should also be wrapped in its own div. This includes the images, buttons, and dots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll also give the first item a class &lt;code&gt;carousel-item-visible&lt;/code&gt; for displaying a default image. We’ll utilize this later for displaying the image a user is currently viewing. We can also do the same thing for the dots giving the first dot a class &lt;code&gt;selected-dot&lt;/code&gt; and setting it to checked.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;rel=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"stylesheet"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"styles.css"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"carousel"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"carousel-item carousel-item-visible"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1537211261771-e525b9e4049b?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=450&amp;amp;q=80"&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"carousel-actions"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"carousel-button-prev"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;aria-label=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Previous"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"carousel-dots"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"dot selected-dot"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"radio"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"dot"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;checked&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"dot"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"radio"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"dot"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"dot"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"radio"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"dot"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"index.js"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, we want to add styling to make the layout appear how we want it to look. We also want to have our images displayed and navigated through in a smooth and user-friendly fashion so we utilize &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@keyframes"&gt;CSS keyframes&lt;/a&gt; for that.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.carousel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;max-width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;600px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;relative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.carousel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.carousel-item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.carousel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.carousel-item-hidden&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* hide all slide images not currently being viewed */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.carousel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.carousel-item-visible&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* show current slide image */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;animation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fadeVisibility&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.5s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* for fading effect when switching between slides */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.carousel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.carousel-item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;max-width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;600px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;/* Navigation control styles */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.carousel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.carousel-actions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;justify-content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;space-between&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* put space between the navigation buttons */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;absolute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* position navigation buttons on top */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* center navigation buttons on the slide */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;translateY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;-50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* align navigation buttons */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.carousel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.carousel-actions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;50px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;white&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;16px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;cursor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;pointer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;40px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;40px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.carousel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.carousel-actions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;#carousel-button-prev&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin-left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;20px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* prevent previous button from touching the side*/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.carousel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.carousel-actions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;#carousel-button-next&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin-right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;20px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* prevent next button from touching the side*/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.carousel-dots&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;text-align&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.dot&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;opacity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* gray out dots for slides not being visted */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.dot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:focus&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;solid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;black&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* dot for currently visited slide */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;/* hanlde smooth transitions between slides */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;@keyframes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fadeVisibility&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="err"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;opacity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="err"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;opacity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now that we have our structure and styling completed for the carousel we can put some life into it. We’ll need to use Javascript to build the functionality for allowing back and forth navigation through our collection of images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we’ll grab all of the moving parts of the carousel that will be needed from the DOM. This includes all of the slides, the next button, the previous button, and the dots. Next, we need a way to keep track of and set the current slide position we’re on and a reference to the total number of slides.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;slides&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementsByClassName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;carousel-item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nextButton&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;carousel-button-next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;prevButton&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;carousel-button-prev&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dots&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementsByClassName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;dot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;numberOfSlides&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;slides&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From there we can start to think about the logic for controlling the back and forth movement of changing image slides. One important thing to note is that we should only be viewing one slide at a time so we’ll need a way to hide all other slides besides the one at the current position. For this we can use a helper function, we’ll call it &lt;code&gt;hideAllSlides()&lt;/code&gt; .&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hideAllSlides&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// remove all slides not currently being viewed&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;slide&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;slides&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;slide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;classList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;carousel-item-visible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;slide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;classList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;carousel-item-hidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now we can utilize our helper function inside of our slide navigation functions which we’ll be building shortly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s implement our navigation functions to control slide movement, we’ll call them &lt;code&gt;handleMoveToNextSlide()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;handleMoveToPrevSlide()&lt;/code&gt; . For each function that handles moving to the previous or next slide, we’ll first call our helper &lt;code&gt;hideAllSlides()&lt;/code&gt; inside of the function so we don’t get multiple slides rendering at once when they are invoked.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleMoveToNextSlide&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hideAllSlides&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleMoveToPrevSlide&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hideAllSlides&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Afterward, we’ll need to set up conditionals that check the current slide position so we know which way to move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the next slide, it will be a check for if we’ve reached the end and in that case, we reset back to the first slide. The previous slide will be the exact opposite, moving to the last slide once we’ve reached the first. The final task would be to set the current slide by adding the class name &lt;code&gt;carousel-item-visible&lt;/code&gt; to the slide at the updated position, then to add the &lt;code&gt;selected-dot&lt;/code&gt; class to the dot at the same position and set it to be checked.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleMoveToNextSlide&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hideAllSlides&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// check if last slide has been reached&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;numberOfSlides&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// go back to first slide&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// move to next slide&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// make current slide visible&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;slides&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;classList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;carousel-item-visible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// update dot to represent current slide&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dots&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;classList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;selected-dot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dots&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;checked&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleMoveToPrevSlide&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hideAllSlides&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// check if we're on the first slide&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;numberOfSlides&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// move to the last slide&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// move back one&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// make current slide visible&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;slides&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;classList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;carousel-item-visible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// update dot to represent current slide&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dots&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;classList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;selected-dot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dots&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;checked&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just one last step!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s add in the event listeners to listen for each click event on the previous and next slide buttons, passing in our &lt;code&gt;handleMoveToNextSlide()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;handleMoveToPrevSlide()&lt;/code&gt; as the callbacks.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nextButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleMoveToNextSlide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;prevButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleMoveToPrevSlide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And that’s all folks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interact with the code pen for our finished zombie images carousel below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#resources"&gt;
