      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.PHP VARIABLE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Php variable start with dollar symbol &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$var1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.STRING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Php string start with &lt;code&gt;""&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;''&lt;/code&gt;etc.&lt;br&gt;
Every program end you need add &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$var1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Hello World!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$var_int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//this integer&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$var1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//output is "Hello World!";&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Minimum Marketable Feature in Agile - What is it?</title>
      <author>Rebecca Ferrao</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 12:53:19 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/rebecca/minimum-marketable-feature-in-agile-what-is-it-559f</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-minimum-marketable-feature"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is 'Minimum Marketable Feature'?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minimum marketable feature (MMF) is a small feature which is delivered fast and gives significant value to the user. The term, MMF, isn't very widely used. However, the first agile principle and the MMF are in alignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first agile principle states that the highest priority of the agile team is to satisfy the user. This is through early and continuous delivery of valuable software to the customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the first agile principle as well as MMF talk about delivering value to the customer. They try to give value that the customer hadn't had before, even if this is done frequently. The term 'marketable' defines this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, value can have a lot of definitions based on where you're looking. It could increase the revenue of the company or reduce customer cost. So, the MMF concept applies to both internal and external products. Products used within an organization as well as ones which are sold outside can make use of MMF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#origin"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Origin
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we have mentioned above, the MMF concept isn't much used. However, it's been around for a few years now. Mark Denne Dr. JaneCleland-Huang wrote about the concept in 2004. Their 2004 book, Software by Numbers: Low-Risk, High-Return Development, spoke about MMF for the first time. The concept has been in use since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#mmf-vs-mvp"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  MMF vs MVP
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may know of the concept of the&lt;a href="https://buildd.co/product/mvp-minimum-viable-product"&gt;Minimum Viable Product&lt;/a&gt; (MVP) and wondering if the MVP and MMF differ in any way. Well, they are different in practice. Let's understand the difference here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-mvp"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The MVP
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, let's look at the definition of the MVP as defined by Eric Reiss in the Lean Startup methodology. The Minimum Viable Product is a version of a new product which requires the least effort but allows maximum learning. This learning is in the form of customer feedback, when the MVP is adopted by early customers of the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MVP tries to check whether the team is building the right thing in the first place. For this sake, they try to use a minimum amount of time and money when making it. The early adopters then give valuable feedback about their experience with the MVP. This allows the team to determine if it's worth going ahead and building the complete product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MVPs need not necessarily be a product. Anything which explains to the user what the product would do can also be considered as an MVP. For example, Dropbox only made a video to show their customers what they could expect out of the end product. Only after they saw that there was demand did they put in effort into creating it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-mmf"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The MMF
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we've already defined an MMF at the start of this blog. The exact textbook definition, as given in 'Software by Numbers', is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'"The Minimum Marketable Feature is the smallest unit of functionality with intrinsic market value.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a real feature, which solves the customer's need in some way. The MMF can be marketed and sold. It's all about releasing products that have a high value, and doing so fast. Building an initial product with the main features and later making incremental, high value changes is an example of an MMF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#minimum-marketable-feature-vs-minimum-viable-product"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Minimum Marketable Feature vs Minimum Viable Product
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, from the above two you can see that while the MVP focuses on learning, the MMF's focus is on providing value to the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MVP may or may not have an MMF, or it could have more than one MMF built into it. Your use of either concept would depend on your context and need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-mmp-minimum-marketable-product"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The MMP - Minimum Marketable Product
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now you know about the MMF and the MVP. However, there's yet another term, the MMP, which may lead to some confusion. Let's understand what the Minimum Marketable Product is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the MVP, the MMP can be considered as the next practical step in the product building process. The MMP is the very core version of the product which has just the basic features needed by it. In other words, only the 'must-have' functionalities are incorporated into the MMP. The 'good-to-haves' aren't added in this stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the MMF, the MMP tries to market a product at a fast pace and with the necessary features. The MMF, focusing on a feature, then becomes a subset of the MMF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#example-of-minimum-marketable-feature"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Example of Minimum Marketable Feature
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an initial product with some solid, core features has been released, there may be a progressive addition of new features. One very stark example is the operating systems of cell phones or computers. The smartphone would of course work right out of the box. But, over the course of using it, users would see that there are more updates added regularly. These are features that add value to the product, but aren't required at the very start. Hence, they can be added incrementally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://buildd.co/product/kano-prioritization-model"&gt;Kano Prioritization Model&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://buildd.co/marketing/pure-competition"&gt;Pure Competition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Is AI responsible for the stock market volatility?</title>
      <author>Mallaya</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 12:35:09 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/mallaya_mathur/is-ai-responsible-for-the-stock-market-volatility-3imm</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/mallaya_mathur/is-ai-responsible-for-the-stock-market-volatility-3imm</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Along with programming, I have developed an interest in the stock market over the past few years. Over the last few days, all the stock markets all over the world including India, the US, the UK, Germany, Japan, and almost every other country are volatile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many experts believe this volatility is because of these reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rise in inflation rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interest rate hike from Banks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increasing fear of Omicron variant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Might be a few regional reasons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, according to me, this might be a reason:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many stockbrokers and operators have started using Artificial Intelligence that reads all charts and once a stock hits a certain number, the AI model buys or sells stokes. I feel an Artificial Intelligence robot does not have emotions or human intelligence and when trades, it becomes harsh for the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do share your thoughts, I would like to read what you think ? Does this make a difference?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Develop Cross Platform Application in Visual Studio Code?</title>
      <author>Pankaj Das</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 12:23:25 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/pankajdas0909/how-to-develop-cross-platform-application-in-visual-studio-code-4939</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/pankajdas0909/how-to-develop-cross-platform-application-in-visual-studio-code-4939</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you want to develop mobile applications with immense user interfaces that are cross-platform supporting iOS, Android, and other platforms?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time has changed; now, it is easier to develop cross-platform apps with Visual Studio Code (VSCode). Believe it or not, VSCode is a game of time for superior app development under Windows providing the best-in-class IDE with sterling stock projects that run smoothly on different mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-visual-studio-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Visual Studio Code?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Visual Studio Code is a lightweight and powerful code editor for modern cloud and web development. It is a widely used source code editor that can be efficiently utilized with various coding languages, which acts on multiple platforms such as macOS, Windows, and Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#its-features-include"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Its features include:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convenient built-in terminal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limitless extensibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy sync across different devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side by side editing vertically and horizontally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Visual Studio Code supports many notable programming languages, which developers prefer in their daily app development tasks. It has extensions features that allow installing any language support on their desktop. Some popular programming language that VS Code support are;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Javascript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Json&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSS, SCSS, and Less&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TypeScript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Markdown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PowerShell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C ++&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Java&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Php&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Know &lt;a href="https://flutteragency.com/set-up-an-emulator-for-vscode/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to set up an Emulator For Visual Studio Code?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the emulator allows your host system to run peripheral devices, tools, software, and other components intended for the guest system. The launching feature relies on support from the available Flutter tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setup-emulator-in-flutter"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setup Emulator in Flutter
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no need for Android Studio to develop or run virtual devices. Utilize avdmanager and SDK manager from the Android SDK tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ICMnFttq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2r7h4xhdga88sovv8q99.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ICMnFttq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2r7h4xhdga88sovv8q99.png" alt="Setup Emulator in Flutter" width="594" height="364"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setup-emulator-in-flutter"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setup Emulator in Flutter
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, use the SDK manager to download a system image of the x86 system,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new virtual device using the adv manager.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the emulator to run the new virtual device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have it, you should install the device using the SDK manager. When you restart VS Code and load the Flutter project, the new device will show up at the bottom right of the footer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run $ open -a Simulator.app command will open the simulator. Now you should go to the Debug option, and tap on “Start Debugging.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Know the features of VS Code&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are several features of using VS Code for developing cross-platform apps&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build, edit, and debug with ease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visual Studio Code is a super-fast source code editor and easy to use. With immense support for several programming languages, VS Code enables you to be highly productive and efficient with auto-indentation, snippets, bracket-matching, box-selection, syntax highlighting, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Community-supported keyboard shortcut mappings, easy customization, and highly intuitive keyboard shortcuts help you create and navigate your code easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will also leverage benefits from its different tools and components for typical coding programs. It includes robust built-in support for rich semantic code understanding, refactoring, navigation, and IntelliSense code completion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smooth debugging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debugging becomes strict with tricky coding. Debugging is one of the features that most programmers miss while learning to code, so it will also help you in this procedure. VS Code provides an interactive debugger, so developers can easily inspect variables, check the source code, execute commands in the console, and view call stacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, VS Code integrates with scripting tools to perform all tasks making the workflows faster. Code offers full support for Git; therefore, you can work with source control without incorporating viewing pending changes diffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extensible and robust architecture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visual Studio Code blends the best of native, web, and language-centric technologies. It combines several web technologies such as Node.JS and JavaScript with the flexibility and speed of native apps. VS Code utilizes a faster and newer version of the industrial-powered HTML-based editor that has powered the Internet Explorer’s F12 tools, “Monaco” cloud editor, and some other projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, to leverage the full benefits of the robust architecture of VS Code, you should connect with the flutter app development company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VS Code utilizes a tools service architecture that helps it easily integrate with several technologies that power it, incorporating Visual Studio debugging engine, TypeScript, Roslyn for .NET, and more. It also contains a public extensibility model that enables developers to create and utilize extensions and get an edit-build-debug experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#final-note"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Final Note
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visual Studio Code offers developers several built-in features and a smooth coding experience. You can utilize its full potential with the help of the flutter app development company. We hope this post is helpful to know how VS helps in developing cross-platform apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://flutteragency.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flutter Agency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a leading Android &amp;amp; iOS cross-platform application development company in the United States.

      <guid>https://dev.to/itsrakesh/lets-explore-different-tech-stacks-4ea0</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After you enter into the software world, you often hear this thing called "Tech Stack" A tech stack is a combination of different technologies to build a complete software product. There are so many tech stacks you can choose from. But you need to know what all the different tech stacks are available and which one suits your needs. So, in this blog, I will introduce you to some tech stacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lets-get-exploring"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Let's get exploring
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5wgHMoGa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/iqgp044zsvs5shmk2d14.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5wgHMoGa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/iqgp044zsvs5shmk2d14.gif" alt="explore" width="498" height="266"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-mern"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. MERN
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M - &lt;strong&gt;MongoDB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
E - &lt;strong&gt;Express&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A - &lt;strong&gt;Angular&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
N - &lt;strong&gt;Node&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angular for frontend; Express and Node for backend; MongoDB for the database. This tech stack can be used to build cloud-hosted, eCommerce, and other enterprise-level applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-mevn"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. MEVN
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uzMJI9Bt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1rp0f7wp1iqwapbhjps6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uzMJI9Bt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1rp0f7wp1iqwapbhjps6.png" alt="MEVN Stack" width="880" height="135"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M - &lt;strong&gt;MongoDB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
E - &lt;strong&gt;Express&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A - &lt;strong&gt;Vue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
N - &lt;strong&gt;Node&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vue for frontend; Express and Node for backend; MongoDB for the database. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All these three tech stacks are similar except for the frontend. And all these stacks are popular and widely used for faster development because we can use a single language(JavaScript) to make a full-stack application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-lamp"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. LAMP

M - &lt;strong&gt;MySQL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
P - &lt;strong&gt;PHP/Perl/Python&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linux for the operating system; Apache for server; MySQL for the database; PHP to dynamically update the web page. This stack is popularly known as LAMP, but it can also be &lt;strong&gt;WAMP&lt;/strong&gt; for Windows and &lt;strong&gt;MAMP&lt;/strong&gt; for MacOS. LAMP is flexible, efficient, powerful, simple, and stable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-aspnet"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. ASP.NET
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tech stack for building applications with ASP.NET&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ASP.NET MVC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ISS Web Server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Angular for frontend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SQL Server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-ror"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. RoR
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yAiwHSlq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3zxg246ea9r47tr4muzs.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yAiwHSlq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3zxg246ea9r47tr4muzs.png" alt="ror" width="880" height="138"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RoR - &lt;strong&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTML, CSS, and JS can be used to build the frontend and RoR for the backend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#7-java"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  7. Java
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tech stack for building applications with Java-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Java(Spring boot and Hibernate) for backend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;React or Angular or Vue for frontend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JavaFX for desktop applications frontend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Java DB for database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;

      <title>Python Computer Vision Libraries Every Developer Should Know</title>
      <author>images.cv</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 11:29:18 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/imagescv/python-computer-vision-libraries-every-developer-should-know-1i00</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/imagescv/python-computer-vision-libraries-every-developer-should-know-1i00</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.python.org/"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most popular languages of the current age. It has gained more popularity with the rise of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Developers of these domains prefer python for coding and developing applications.&lt;br&gt;
Since Computer Vision falls under a wide umbrella of Artificial Intelligence, python is widely used for CV-related applications. In this article, we will discuss the gold standard libraries for python that are used for the development of computer vision applications.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://opencv.org/"&gt;OpenCV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in commercial products.&lt;br&gt;
The library has more than 2500 optimized algorithms, which includes a comprehensive set of both classic and state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning algorithms. These algorithms can be used to detect and recognize faces, identify objects, classify human actions in videos, track camera movements, track moving objects, extract 3D models of objects, produce 3D point clouds from stereo cameras, stitch images together to produce a high-resolution image of an entire scene, find similar images from an image database, remove red eyes from images taken using flash, follow eye movements, recognize scenery and establish markers to overlay it with augmented reality, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://keras.io/"&gt;Keras&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Keras is an API designed with humans in mind rather than machines. Keras follows best practices for reducing cognitive load. It offers consistent &amp;amp; simple APIs, minimizes the number of user actions required for common use cases, and it provides clear &amp;amp; actionable error messages. It also has extensive documentation and developer guides.&lt;br&gt;
Keras is the most used deep learning framework among the top-5 winning tea&lt;br&gt;
ms on Kaggle.&lt;br&gt;
Built on top of TensorFlow 2, Keras is an industry-strength framework that can scale to large clusters of GPUs or an entire TPU pod.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://matplotlib.org/"&gt;Matplotlib&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Matplotlib makes easy things easy and hard things possible.&lt;br&gt;
Create publication-quality plots.&lt;br&gt;
Make interactive figures that can zoom, pan, update.&lt;br&gt;
Customize visual style and layout.&lt;br&gt;
Export to many file formats.&lt;br&gt;
Embed in JupyterLab and Graphical User Interfaces.&lt;br&gt;
Use a rich array of third-party packages built on Matplotlib.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="//scikit-image.org"&gt;Scikit-Image&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
scikit-image is an open-source image processing library for the Python programming language. It comprises a wide collection of algorithms for image processing such as segmentation, geometric transformations, color space manipulation, analysis, filtering, morphology, feature detection, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/imutils/"&gt;Imutils&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Imutils is a series of convenience functions to make basic image processing functions such as translation, rotation, resizing, skeletonization, and displaying Matplotlib images easier with OpenCV and both Python 2.7 and Python 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://scipy.org/"&gt;SciPy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
SciPy is a free and open-source Python library used for scientific computing and technical computing. SciPy contains modules for optimization, linear algebra, integration, interpolation, special functions, FFT, signal and image processing, ODE solvers, and other tasks common in science and engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/"&gt;Pillow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Python Imaging Library is a free and open-source additional library for the Python programming language that adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats. It is available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.&lt;br&gt;
This library provides extensive file format support, an efficient internal representation, and fairly powerful image processing capabilities.&lt;br&gt;
The core image library is designed for fast access to data stored in a few basic pixel formats. It should provide a solid foundation for a general image processing tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://numpy.org/"&gt;NumPy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more. At the core of the NumPy package, is the ndarray object. This encapsulates n-dimensional arrays of homogeneous data types, with many operations being performed in compiled code for performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/"&gt;TensorFlow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on the training and inference of deep neural networks.&lt;br&gt;
It is an end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML, and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In this article, we discussed the most popular libraries that allow computer vision applications to be deployed and manipulated. These libraries are a gold standard for anyone who wants to enter the domain of Computer Vision in Python.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://images.cv/"&gt;images.cv&lt;/a&gt; provide you with an easy way to build image datasets.&lt;br&gt;
15K+ categories to choose from&lt;br&gt;
Consistent folders structure for easy parsing&lt;br&gt;
Advanced tools for dataset pre-processing: image format, data split, image size and data augmentation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Loading Animation with CSS only</title>
      <author>Rohit Sharma</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 11:28:19 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/devrohit0/loading-animation-with-css-only-4i6n</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/devrohit0/loading-animation-with-css-only-4i6n</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello Everyone, Today we are going to create cool loading animation with CSS only. So, let's get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our final result will look like this&lt;br&gt;
&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d0-QyIYldbY"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end of this post I attached Codepen Pen.&lt;br&gt;
Firstly we have to write some HTML&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;L&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;O&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;A&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;D&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;I&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;G&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We just created 7 &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and now it's time to write CSS part for this loading animation effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First set margin and padding to 0&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;bolder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now set &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;display:flex&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;justify-content:center&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;align-items:center&lt;/code&gt; to center the LOADING word.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;justify-content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;align-items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;100vh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;#333&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now set &lt;code&gt;font-size&lt;/code&gt; to a desired value and set &lt;code&gt;margin&lt;/code&gt; to create some gap inbetween .&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;30px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;5px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now target the individual letter with &lt;code&gt;nth-child()&lt;/code&gt; pseudo selector to animate them. Set &lt;code&gt;animation-delay&lt;/code&gt; of each child to some random value. So, there is a difference in their timing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:nth-child&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;animation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;linear&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;infinite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:nth-child&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;animation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.11s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;linear&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;infinite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:nth-child&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;animation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.47s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;linear&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;infinite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:nth-child&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;orange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;animation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.24s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;linear&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;infinite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:nth-child&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;cyan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;animation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.3s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;linear&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;infinite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:nth-child&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;magenta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;animation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.19s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;linear&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;infinite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Create a keyframe to animate them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;@keyframes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="err"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;translateY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;-14px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="err"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;rotateY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;90deg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="err"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;translateY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;-14px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/godzillaa/embed/dyVRazQ?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we change &lt;code&gt;transform&lt;/code&gt; with respect to Y axis to X-axis the final result will look like this.&lt;br&gt;
Codepen:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/godzillaa/embed/Bawddzx?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will only explain the javascript code about Intersection observer and Header animation in this blog. Because that will be quite long and you will not like that. Instead, I will go over HTML and css briefly. Don't worry you will understand. If you don't understand anything, please watch the video and feel free to ask me questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#so-lets-do-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  So, Let's do it.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will make the page with a mobile first approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#footer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Footer
&lt;/h4&gt;

    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"footer__text"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;SPACEX © 2021&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;ul&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"footer__list"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Explaination:
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, we have selected all the mission containers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then we created a new Instance of &lt;code&gt;IntersectionObserver&lt;/code&gt;. We have passed a&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then we created a new Instance of &lt;code&gt;IntersectionObserver&lt;/code&gt;. We have passed a function that will run every time an element comes into the view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We loop over every single mission element and observe them with &lt;code&gt;missionObserver&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We got all the entries(array of objects) as params. Every entry has two properties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;isIntersecting: boolean value if an element is on the view or not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;target: Current element.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If &lt;code&gt;isIntersecting&lt;/code&gt; is true then we will attach the &lt;code&gt;on__screen&lt;/code&gt; class to that element. Else we will remove the class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;on__screen&lt;/code&gt; class will be responsible to show the &lt;code&gt;bottom__content&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;classList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;SHOW&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;prevScrollPos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentScrollPos&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#let-me-explain-the-header-animation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Let me explain the header animation.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Header will only be displayed if &lt;code&gt;header&lt;/code&gt; has a &lt;code&gt;show&lt;/code&gt; class. By default, it will be there. If we are scrolling down, then the &lt;code&gt;show&lt;/code&gt; class will be removed. And will be added if we scroll down. When we will remove the class, we will attach a &lt;code&gt;hiding&lt;/code&gt; id. After &lt;code&gt;0.9s&lt;/code&gt; we will remove that id.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The background will be shown only if the header has the &lt;code&gt;with__background&lt;/code&gt; class. If&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The background will be shown only if the header has the &lt;code&gt;with__background&lt;/code&gt; class. If the scroll position is on the top half of the page then &lt;code&gt;with__background&lt;/code&gt; class will be removed.&lt;br&gt;
There will be two types of animation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scroll down:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Header inner part will be removed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then background will be removed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, the header will be removed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scroll up:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Header will be shown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Background will be shown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Header inner part will be shown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing you need to care about is the animation duration and delay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scroll up:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Header will come instantly without any delay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Background will be shown in &lt;code&gt;0.5&lt;/code&gt; second with a &lt;code&gt;0.1&lt;/code&gt; delay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Header inner part will be shown in &lt;code&gt;0.2&lt;/code&gt; second. But it will be after&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Header inner part will be shown in &lt;code&gt;0.2&lt;/code&gt; second. But it will be after background animation which will take &lt;code&gt;0.5 + 0.1 = 0.6&lt;/code&gt;second. So, it will be our delay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scroll down:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now we only need to change the delay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Header inner will disappear without delay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Background will be removed after header inner. Header inner animation will take about &lt;code&gt;0.2&lt;/code&gt; seconds. So background delay would be &lt;code&gt;0.3&lt;/code&gt;second.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Header will be removed after the Background. Background animation will take &lt;code&gt;0.5 + 0.3&lt;/code&gt; second. So, the delay would be &lt;code&gt;0.9&lt;/code&gt;second.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Why Your Small Business Should Adopt Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</title>
      <author>Alex Sanders</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 11:24:12 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/alexsan28195851/why-your-small-business-should-adopt-two-factor-authentication-2fa-3hle</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/alexsan28195851/why-your-small-business-should-adopt-two-factor-authentication-2fa-3hle</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cyber attacks are on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a 400% increase in cybersecurity complaints to the FBI. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No company wants to be the next Colonial Pipeline, who were forced to pay a $4.4 million ransom, or the next Cambridge Analytica, who leaked millions of Facebook users’ personal data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may think cyber criminals only target big companies where there’s more to steal. However, hackers prey on small- and midsize businesses (SMBs) just as much because they tend to have fewer safeguards in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019, one data breach cost an SMB an average of $149,000. That’s more than twice what the average small business owner makes in a year and could easily put a business under.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid security breaches, small businesses need to act now by adopting multiple forms of identity verification for their employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One easy way to do this is through a form of multi-factor authentication (MFA) called two-factor authentication (2FA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-twofactor-authentication-2fa"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two-factor authentication (2FA) verifies a user’s identity in two steps for an added layer of security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step demands a username and password. And the second step usually involves getting a time-sensitive six-digit code or one-time password (OTP) on a separate device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the second step could also be a security question or even a fingerprint scan. What makes it 2FA is that it requires two separate steps to log in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#benefits-of-twofactor-authentication-2fa"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Benefits of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2FA offers an additional layer of security. It’s twice as hard for hackers to break through because it requires cracking two separate barriers. Plus, even if someone cracks through one layer of security, 2FA systems immediately alert users of the suspicious activity so you can quickly react by temporarily locking your account and notifying a manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extra level of security could be the difference between your company experiencing a major cyberattack that leads to millions in lost revenue or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2FA is also easy to implement. Many hate having to deal with cumbersome security practices, but 2FA makes it easy by allowing you to use your smartphone or even your finger. This saves time and takes a huge burden off internal security teams who must otherwise manage complicated security systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And by &lt;a href="https://www.palmtech.net/it-support-services-west-palm-beach/"&gt;outsourcing your security to a professional IT management company&lt;/a&gt;, you can make 2FA data security a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#types-of-twofactor-authentication-2fa"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Types of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve mentioned a few types of 2FA, but there are actually quite a few secondary verifications that you can combine with a traditional username and password to form 2FA:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;SMS token&lt;/strong&gt; — A password sent in a text to your phone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Email token&lt;/strong&gt; — A password sent to you by email&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;App token&lt;/strong&gt; — A password or push verification sent to you within an installed app on your phone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Biometric token&lt;/strong&gt; — A part of your body that identifies you like a fingerprint, eye scan, or voice recognition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Security question(s)&lt;/strong&gt; — A personal question that identifies you, like “what is your mother’s maiden name?” or “what is the name of your elementary school?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-set-up-twofactor-authentication-2fa"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to Set Up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To set up 2FA for your small business, first identify what data you need to protect. This could include emails, databases, reports, financial information, and more. Just remember that the more you protect by 2FA, the safer your business will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, identify who needs to use 2FA. Any employees who need access to the protected data should be required to use 2FA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, choose a 2FA type and platform. The type of 2FA will help determine what platform to use, but popular platforms include Authy, LastPass Authenticator, and Microsoft Authenticator. Choose one that is convenient and makes the most sense for your company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#final-tips"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Final Tips
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter the size of your business, security should be a top priority. Even if it’s just you, you wouldn’t want your bank information hacked, and all your business income jeopardized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So consider implementing 2FA today. It’s easy to get started and the small investment will pay for itself many times over by preventing future cyberattacks. After all, it’s not a matter of if you will experience a cyberattack but when.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>7 Resources to Level Up your Web Development Game</title>
      <author>notmahnoor</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 11:23:53 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/notmahnoor/9-resources-to-level-up-your-web-development-game-pkn</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/notmahnoor/9-resources-to-level-up-your-web-development-game-pkn</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Web development stands for building and maintaining websites, whether a static one or a complex one. A static website doesn’t require a lot of work, but complex web applications have huge databases and real-time, data-intensive applications like eCommerce and social media apps. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;front-end developer&lt;/strong&gt; designs the part of the web that users interact with. Everything from user navigation, fonts, and colors to drop-down menus and sliders. All of these are built using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;back-end developer&lt;/strong&gt; powers the front-end part of the website so it could actually work. From storing massive amounts of data to maintaining the technology that powers all components on a website, a back-end developer does it all. Languages like PHP, Ruby, Python, Java, etc. are employed at the back-end. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a combination of both front-end and back-end makes a &lt;strong&gt;full-stack developer&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web development has recently risen up in high demand in the post-pandemic world where many businesses and services have shifted online, increasing the need for web developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, this is the perfect time to get your hands dirty with learning web development. Below is a list of websites and platforms to get you started!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#codecademy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/web-development"&gt;Codecademy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#freecodecamp"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/"&gt;Freecodecamp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://roadmap.sh/"&gt;Road Map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest challenges a developer faces is not knowing where to start or the path to achieve their goal. Road map provides visual guides containing topics, tools, and all the necessities that a developer would need to start his/her journey of web development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#w3schools"&gt;

      <title>How dark patterns can harm privacy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Privacy is a common concern. While there are severe issues with broken platforms such as Facebook and sneaky techniques such as fingerprinting, other methods are used to manipulate users' choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not uncommon Websites, and applications use &lt;strong&gt;dark patterns&lt;/strong&gt; to trick users into granting their consent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#privacy-by-design-vs-by-policy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Privacy by design vs. by policy
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Privacy by design" is certainly better than "privacy by policy", as privacy is built into the system at every layer, and protection is enabled &lt;strong&gt;by default&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of reacting to a data breach, the architecture proactively protects users by minimizing data collection, lowering the potential damages during an incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, users benefit from End-to-End protection, with authentication and encryption everywhere the data goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In such user-centric systems, users can either grant or revoke consent to use their data: &lt;strong&gt;users own their data&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#optout-is-possible-somehow"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Opt-out is possible... somehow
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Websites have to obtain consent to track users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are multiple ways to influence the final choice, though. A widespread technique used by almost all platforms consists of using legalese to describe requested permissions, so the users cannot determine whether the request is legitimate or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically speaking, it's consent, and it's perfectly legal. However, I've sometimes had difficulties understanding the subtle differences between a typical scam and an app permissions screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may vary from one country to another, but websites have to provide ways to opt-out tracking as a legal duty. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, the accept button is often designed with a big font size, a visible color, and a recognizable icon, while the link to opt-out is hidden below a pretty long text and left unstyled, so it's very easy to miss it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#subscribe-to-our-newsletter"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  "Subscribe to our newsletter" 😈
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many websites only display a newsletter form at the end of posts and in some frequently visited areas, others trigger a popup inviting you to subscribe as soon as you arrive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar pattern described in the last section can be used: the email input is enormous in the popup with a big button to validate the subscription, and there's no close button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, you get an unstyled link with a small size displaying an unclear message such as "No, I do not want to enjoy the latest news," while you just want to close the popup. Sometimes, it even shames users that do not wish to subscribe with inappropriate messages such as "No, I don't want to be smart," which is a psychological bias. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These dark patterns may appear pretty lame, but they are pretty efficient to grab emails &lt;strong&gt;in the short term&lt;/strong&gt;, which is why many websites use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ads-allow-the-worst-practices"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Ads allow the worst practices
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some practices with ads are questionable. Many websites display them near or over the content, but when the user tries to close these unwanted windows, it still triggers the click because the close button is deliberately too small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This technique is heavily used to artificially increase impressions, especially with touch screens and mobile devices. It's a striking example of dark patterns, as the user has to close the ad to see the content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, advertisers and marketers use now appealing terms such as "customized experience" or "personalized ads," as more and more people suspect there could be bad practices behind the word "tracking".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dark-patterns-can-be-unhealthy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Dark patterns can be unhealthy
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Platforms such as YouTube claim they help fight against fake news by censoring suspicious content. I seriously doubt it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their AI collects all kinds of data to make personalized recommendations and, above all, keep the user on the platform. People susceptible to conspiracy theories and dark thoughts get even more biased content than they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YouTube's algorithms aren't meant to make people think outside the box. Quite the contrary, users get content they already approve and like, which might be palatable for entertainment but not for political information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such platforms would likely amplify misinformation rather than deconstruct it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned a few patterns you might already know in other contexts. While websites and platforms did not invent those tricks, technology put the scam to an unprecedented level, automating data abuses and deception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if authorities try to regulate the phenomenon, it is difficult to stop, and dark patterns allow data brokers to circumvent legal duties and harm users' privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
