      <title>Why and Why Not use No-Code?</title>
      <author>Vik 📈</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/heyvik/why-and-why-not-use-no-code-nd1</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As my no-code blog just blasted off, here's another. So, in this blog, I will tell some reason to use and some reason to not use no-code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-nocode"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is No-Code?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A no code development platform is a tool for building software applications without coding. No-Code is made for people in every background to create stuff/software. No code platforms have pre-built drag-and-drop elements that have been coded for reuse and scale, so that anyone, even beginners can make anything they want easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-does-it-even-works"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How does it even works?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As told above, no code tools already got drag-and-drop elements which you can use to create your website. You can then easily see, how will it look in desktop, tablet, phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you build on a no code platform, you are building with code, you simply don’t have to do any coding, as those drag-and-drop elements ( and the whole software ) is build using code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following me on twitter helps me a lot &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vikstack"&gt;so consider following&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-use-no-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why use no code?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay so lets now come to the point, why we should use no code?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#faster-development"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Faster Development
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most development is done via a drag-and-drop interface, so this means building something will be a lot faster than using code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#low-cost"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Low Cost
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers are expensive, using no code tools will let you reduce it. You can build apps faster and cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#increased-productivity"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Increased Productivity
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the building time of something is way less than using code, it simply means that the thing that was being done in months can now be done in days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;
  &lt;a href="#there-are-many-more-reasons-to-use-no-code-but-for-this-blog-its-enough"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  There are many more reasons to use no code, but for this blog, its enough.
&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-not-use-no-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why not use no code?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;okay so as I told you the pros of no code lets come to cons of no code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most common problem with no code is for more complex use cases, they are too restrictive to produce the desired results. The drag-and-drop elements are inherently more restrictive than the underlying code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#users-must-have-a-clear-understanding-of-their-requirements"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Users must have a clear understanding of their requirements.
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;while using no code platforms a user first need to thing that if the requirements can be fulfilled by that specific tool?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#extensive-training-required"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Extensive Training Required
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As no code tools make development faster, you need extensive training before. Some no code tools are a lot too harder to understand&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are yet many many other way that stops you from using no code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading this blog. Cheers&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL in SQL?</title>
      <author>Bobby Iliev</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 19 Nov 2021 10:21:48 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/bobbyiliev/what-is-the-difference-between-union-and-union-all-in-sql-1e8b</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/bobbyiliev/what-is-the-difference-between-union-and-union-all-in-sql-1e8b</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you've ever used SQL, you probably know that &lt;code&gt;UNION&lt;/code&gt;s can be quite confusing at first. In this quick post we are going to learn what the difference between &lt;code&gt;UNION&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;UNION ALL&lt;/code&gt; is!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#difference-between-raw-union-endraw-and-raw-union-all-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Difference between &lt;code&gt;UNION&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;UNION ALL&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main thing to keep in mind is that if you use &lt;code&gt;UNION&lt;/code&gt; it would remove the duplicate records from the two columns, where as &lt;code&gt;UNION ALL&lt;/code&gt; does not remove the duplicates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using &lt;code&gt;UNION&lt;/code&gt;, your database server would need to do some extra operations in order to get rid of the duplicate values, which essentially would be slower compared to using &lt;code&gt;UNION ALL&lt;/code&gt; where the database server would not have to do this extra work. However &lt;code&gt;UNION&lt;/code&gt; is more commonly used as in most cases you do not need the duplicate records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#example"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Example
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep this simple, let's say that we have the following two tables with matching number of columns:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users: with columns &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;username&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Admins: with columns &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;username&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rows in each table are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users data:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT id,username FROM users;
// Output:
+----+----------+
| id | username |
+----+----------+
|  1 | bobby    |
|  2 | devdojo  |
|  3 | tony     |
|  4 | greisi   |
+----+----------+
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Admins data:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT id,username FROM admins;
// Output:
+------+----------+
| id   | username |
+------+----------+
|    1 | bobby    |
|    4 | greisi   |
+------+----------+
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With that out of the way, let's have a couple of examples!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-union-endraw-example"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;UNION&lt;/code&gt; Example
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using &lt;code&gt;UNION&lt;/code&gt; your database would do the extra work that we mentioned above, and get rid of the duplicate rows, in our case we have &lt;code&gt;bobby&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;greisi&lt;/code&gt; present in both tables, so if we were to run the following query:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT id,username FROM users UNION SELECT * FROM admins;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The output that we would get would be the following:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Output
+------+----------+
| id   | username |
+------+----------+
|    1 | bobby    |
|    2 | devdojo  |
|    3 | tony     |
|    4 | greisi   |
+------+----------+
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you can see there are no duplicate records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-union-all-endraw-example"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;UNION ALL&lt;/code&gt; Example
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike &lt;code&gt;UNION&lt;/code&gt; the &lt;code&gt;UNION ALL&lt;/code&gt; statement would keep the duplicates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's see what happens when we run the same query as above, but use &lt;code&gt;UNION ALL&lt;/code&gt; instead:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT id,username FROM users UNION ALL SELECT * FROM admins;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Output:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;+------+----------+
| id   | username |
+------+----------+
|    1 | bobby    |
|    2 | devdojo  |
|    3 | tony     |
|    4 | greisi   |
|    1 | bobby    |
|    4 | greisi   |
+------+----------+
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you can see in this case, the rows from &lt;code&gt;admins&lt;/code&gt; table were directly appended after the &lt;code&gt;users&lt;/code&gt; rows including the duplicated values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is pretty much it! Now you know what the difference between a &lt;code&gt;UNION&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;UNION ALL&lt;/code&gt; is!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>RUNNING OUR FIRST IN-PERSON EVENT IN COVID TIMES</title>
      <author>Ruth Cheesley</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 19 Nov 2021 10:21:24 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/rcheesley/running-our-first-in-person-event-in-covid-times-314o</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/rcheesley/running-our-first-in-person-event-in-covid-times-314o</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I am just heading home from a really wonderful few days full of energy, excitement, collaboration and enthusiasm like I haven’t seen in several years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mautic Community came together this week in Hasselt, Belgium for our first ever in-person conference, &lt;a href="https://mauticon.mautic.org"&gt;Mautic Conference Europe&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;We had &lt;a href="https://www.mautic.org/blog/community/first-mautic-community-summit-a-great-success"&gt;one previous in person event&lt;/a&gt; back in 2019 directly after the acquisition of Mautic Inc. by Acquia where we were just setting up our governance models and starting work on Mautic 3, and then the pandemic hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, everything we have organised has had to be virtual, and while it’s better than nothing it simply does not (in my opinion) replace the in-person event in open source communities.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In open source, most of the folks involved are volunteers who are contributing because they love the product, the community, but most importantly the relationships we build when we get to know each other.  That simply does not happen in the same way as with virtual conferences and sprints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also found over the last few days that contributions are super-charged during in person events, because folks are all sitting in a room together and can get help quickly. Also most folk were able to step away from their ‘real’ work and other commitments for the majority of the two days, without being distracted - not always possible to do when you’re at home or in the office!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#planning-the-event%C2%A0"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Planning the event 
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course given the situation in regards to the coronavirus pandemic, it was a big decision to go ahead with an in-person event.  We purposely focus on inviting the local community for these events, but naturally because our community is worldwide, often we have folks coming from all over the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you balance needing to put in place precautions to keep people safe, with facilitating building those all important relationships and also acknowledging the free choice of the individual when it comes to things like vaccinations?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to adopt the requirements to enter the country as our basic mandatory requirements to attend the event, which included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Being fully vaccinated; OR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Having proof of a negative PCR test no more than 72 hours before arriving in the country&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be sensible to make sure you know the requirements for any country you are planning an event in, and keep up to date with the changes on those requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top tip: I used &lt;a href="https://changetower.com"&gt;changetower.com&lt;/a&gt; to track changes on the main pages from the Belgian government relating to covid-19 travel requirements. This allowed me to get a daily notification of any changes that had been made and communicate this out to the attendees and team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did also struggle with folk who needed to get a visa to attend - two were declined citing that there wasn't a good enough justification for travelling - so that's something to bear in mind if you have international speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#during-the-event"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  During the event
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to make it mandatory for every attendee to take a rapid antigen (lateral flow) test each morning of the event as further reassurance.  We asked people to bring their own tests, but most did not - an additional cost we were not expecting but probably should have planned for!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the event, masks were required when moving around the venue and in any public spaces, but not during the actual conference and sprints themselves when seated and working together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also had alcohol hand gel throughout the venues and people were encouraged to ensure they were using it regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We offered attendees the opportunity to show with the colour of their lanyard how comfortable they were with physical contact: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--14LW850x--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hl26uxdivkqnr8je4bym.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--14LW850x--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hl26uxdivkqnr8je4bym.jpg" alt="Colour coded lanyards" width="880" height="1173"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Green: All good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Orange: Happy to shake hands but no closer please!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Red: Please keep 2m apart (but we can still chat!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the vast majority of attendees chose a green lanyard, with a few choosing orange, I feel that this was a very helpful way to give people the ability to share their own comfort level with physical closeness without the awkwardness of having to pull back from over-enthusiastic huggers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hypothesised that most folks attending are probably comfortable with close contact, whereas those who are not were probably not ready to attend in-person events at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference centre we chose had a maximum capacity of 70, and we were planning for 50. We ended up having about 30 attendees, which meant that we were able to be quite spaced out in the auditorium and the plaza area (where lunch and breaks took place) without too much difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#community-sprint"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Community Sprint
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the main conference we organised a Community Sprint and a Leadership Team Summit - both of which were hybrid, in that people could join us virtually via Slack and video call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In retrospect we could have held the main event as a hybrid event, however it simply came down to the matter of resources. We did not have enough volunteers to help us with putting on a hybrid event, so we chose to focus just on the in-person experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The community sprint, however, was fully open to anyone.  We had a great range of participation from people working on a pitch deck to help agencies and individuals with pitching Mautic, to developers working on reviewing, testing and adding automated tests to features and bug fixes which were in our backlog, through to the education team working on documentation resources and the community team putting together a blueprint for how to run contribution events in local communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ACK9QUCW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wf6x0zi9mwvda9fwek98.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ACK9QUCW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wf6x0zi9mwvda9fwek98.jpeg" alt="Some of the product team working on bugs and new features" width="880" height="660"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was great to see people really excited and inspired to contribute, and to see the phenomenal momentum that was generated as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We organised this by creating a Miro board for each team. This enabled the team leads to identify key tasks that people could pick up and work on during the day, while allowing everyone to see in real time where the tasks were in the workflow and which ones needed working on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also served as a record of what had been accomplished by each team when we did our round-up at the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lunch was - of course - an epic pizza order!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SbkA6MBh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oafkmb97cd5ccyh29yoz.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SbkA6MBh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oafkmb97cd5ccyh29yoz.png" alt="The epic pizza order" width="400" height="533"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#evening-socials%C2%A0"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Evening socials 
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We organised some informal social gatherings on the evenings where people were going to be in Hasselt, at various venues nearby the hotel where the team and speakers were staying. We found some really fantastic venues who were great at catering to an international audience with varying dietary requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Belgium there is a requirement for visiting restaurants or cafes to have a QR code which can be scanned (locally it is called the Covidsafe app) to show you’re fully vaccinated or have a negative PCR test result - this caused a problem for a few people who did not have a scannable vaccine record. Most people had no problems at all with their codes being scanned from all over the world - the app recognised them all without any problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some places the folks who didn’t have a QR code to be scanned were allowed to enter, some they were not - there didn’t seem to be much in the way of rationale behind whether they were or were not allowed in.  We were also required to provide some form of ID (e.g. a passport, drivers license) to accompany the vaccine or PCR test record to ensure you were the person who the vaccine/test record relates to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, we had a really awesome event and I feel that we took all the precautions that we could to ensure that our attendees' health and safety were front and centre.  It was a bit of a novelty to do the covid tests each morning, but I am glad that we enforced that requirement as an additional safety check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everybody who attended really enjoyed the event and gained a lot from coming together in person. We certainly gained a lot as a community from the opportunity to sit around a table together and work through things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were fortunate in that we didn't have anybody experiencing covid-related symptoms during the event, or any confirmed positive tests. I would suggest that as an event organiser, you need to think about what you would do if someone were to test positive, and have plans to deal with that situation - especially if they were a speaker or a member of your team.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  QA audit in European banking applications: standards and data security
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banking applications are one of the most complicated applications, so their development and testing involve challenging processes. One of them is the QA audit that the Banking in EU follows according to EU-defined Standards. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;QA audits are essential components for getting things in testing done correctly. These functions contribute reassurance to the quality of developed software and help in finding ways to improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recognition of the benefits of a more coordinated cross-border approach to banking supervision, in 2012 European leaders legislated to establish the European banking union under the umbrella of the European Central Bank (ECB).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-are-the-standards-applied-to-banking-applications-in-the-eu"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What are the standards applied to banking applications in the EU?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since November 2014, the ECB (European Central Bank) has been trusted to supervise QA audit functions across the euro area. It was a game-changer for European banking supervision. Banks can now analyze risks swiftly and holistically with a single supervisor in place, which helps draw on peer comparisons across the banking sector. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ECB does not work alone – competent national authorities (NCAs) support each member state.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This collaboration framework is called Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM): ECB controls the day-to-day supervision of significant banks, whereas NCAs conduct audits for less powerful banks under ECB supervision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ECB’s direct supervision does not include staff only from ECB but rather from joint supervisory teams from ECB and NCAs sides. This act results in a collaborative effort directed by both European and particular countries’ national bank officials. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Supervisory Quality Assurance (SQA) Division and internal auditors of ECB have each made significant contributions to adjust the standard methods while helping them to safeguard the consistency and quality of the supervisory activities at the ECB. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The division has created the SQA network to work with counterparts. They have developed its methodology, paving the way for partner banks to ensure good quality under European banking supervision. As a result, almost all critical supervisory processes have been quality-assured, and ECB has learned valuable lessons about improving its processes and deliverables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This practice has facilitated improvements in both the planning and the practical implementation of their supervision. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ECB has introduced the single training curriculum for European banking based on the first quality assurance reviews. This new training curriculum is entrusted by the SQA division of all partner banks in the EU. This curriculum offers over 100 different courses grouped according to four distinct professional profiles. These courses have been very successful in ensuring software quality with both ECB and NCA staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#data-security-aspects-a-bank-cant-omit-while-applying-for-qa-audit-in-the-eu"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Data security aspects a bank can’t omit while applying for QA audit in the EU
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;✅ The EBA Guidelines need EU Banks to examine, execute, and monitor various security measures.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security testing is one of the significant stages in the entire application testing cycle, as this stage ensures that the application complies with defined EU banking standards. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banking apps are sensitive and a prime target for hackers &amp;amp; fraudulent activities due to the nature of the data they transmit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;✅ A company should not omit the security guidelines defined by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) and the European commission bank (ECB).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security scanning reports should be available to the relevant stakeholders after their completion. The development team should provide the fixes of identified vulnerabilities before applying a QA audit in the EU. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;✅ Penetration testing can also be part of this step to determine the propagation of errors.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various platforms, networks, and OS must be checked through rigorous security testing techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#procedures-for-banking-software-to-get-compliant-with-the-eu-banking-audit"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Procedures for banking software to get compliant with the EU banking audit
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU banking audit function follows a risk-based approach to assessing critical supervisory tasks and activities since the inception of ECB Banking Supervision. This process has included the actions in a range of essential areas, including information management, how the banks monitor the implementation of supervisory measures, and its SREP (Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bank must check its SREP before applying its audit. In addition, the Banks benefit from the ECB’s Internal Audit Committee (IAC) scrutiny for processes involving intense cooperation between the ECB and national authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The guidance issued by Internal Audit helps ECB Banking Supervision identify areas for improvement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the internal audit findings are available, the SQA department works to support the frontline supervisory audit staff in preparing action plans to ensure appropriate follow-up and risk mitigation. It then coordinates and oversees the timely and consistent implementation of the action plans, reporting annually to the supervisory audit board on the progress made. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frequent communication between the SQA teams and the Internal audit committee is an essential part of the process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, experts from the SQA department should be well prepared before the QA audit. These two teams work constantly and fluidly together towards the shared objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-are-the-tendencies-in-the-field"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What are the tendencies in the field?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, the interests of financial institutions have increased in outsourcing business activities. Their major intention is to decrease the costs and improve working flexibility and efficiency. Bank institutions are adapting their business models to embrace such technologies in the context of digitalization and then increase the importance of new financial technology to other fintech providers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the fields is testing which many banks are doing through outsourcing. Testing banking applications requires an end-to-end testing methodology involving multiple Software Testing techniques. These various testing practices ensure the working of functional flow as per core business requirements, its security aspects, data integrity features, concurrency, and the user experience. The testing field is very dominant amongst other functional operations needed for Banking software. Different testing expertise for banking applications is in high demand, and many outsourcing companies are looking for experts in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-can-the-process-of-qa-audit-in-banking-be-optimized"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How can the process of QA audit in banking be optimized?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Banking Authority (EBA) has published some guidelines which all banking institutions must follow related to outsourcing and using cloud technologies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internal audit function’s activities, as per EBA defined guidelines, should follow a risk-based approach that involves the independent review of outsourced activities. Therefore, the audit plan and program include the outsourcing arrangements of critical functions. The internal audit function ascertains outsourcing that the payment institution’s framework is accurately and efficiently implemented and in line with the relevant laws and regulations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These include the analysis of the risk strategy and management decisions; the credibility, quality, and effectiveness of essential functions; the efficiency of outsourcing approaches; the appropriate involvement of governance bodies; and the appropriate monitoring and management of outsourcing arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-part-plays-the-european-banking-authority-eba-in-software-qa"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What part plays the European Banking Authority (EBA) in software QA?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Banking Authority (EBA) has been regularly performing testing exercises across the European Union, and influential among them are stress testing, security testing, and compatibility testing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the EBA, the aim is to assess the flexibility of EU banks against a standard set of adverse economic developments to identify the potential risks and to inform supervisory decisions, and increase market discipline. The European Central Bank (ECB) and other European competent authorities support these QA audit exercises and use them to make supervisory decisions. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tales of the Autistic Developer – Order and Chaos</title>
      <author>Brandon Weaver</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 19 Nov 2021 10:05:15 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/baweaver/tales-of-the-autistic-developer-order-and-chaos-2o0p</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/baweaver/tales-of-the-autistic-developer-order-and-chaos-2o0p</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For those who don't know me, I'm autistic. I've been a developer for the better part of a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn't find out I was ASD until 19, and didn't reconcile with that until years later. These posts will be a combination of advice I've given to those who are like me, as well as a letter of sorts to my past self who could have used a lot of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I write these posts in the hopes that someone like me will find value in knowing a very simple and very important truth about ASD:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You are not alone, and you are loved.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#order-and-chaos"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Order and Chaos
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I am most certainly autistic, I'm also ADHD, making for a very interesting mix of traits. My mind, quite simply, operates in a mode of constant chaos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It bounces from idea to idea as fast as something catches its fancy, and trying to tame it into some semblance of productivity has been my life's work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The irony then is that my entire existence is implementing systems of order by which to counteract that natural state of chaos, but the deeper irony? Both have become indispensable to my work, and how I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-state-of-chaos"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A State of Chaos
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my decade or more of experience in the industry I've come to a very simple truth:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hardest problems in technology are organizational, rather than technological.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While solutions may certainly exist, discovering them, building consensus, and orchestrating the release ends up being an exercise in chaos more often than not. There are entire categories of problems that are well beyond the scope of a single engineer, and quite frankly should be despite the best efforts of some to do otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The larger the problem the larger the surrounding context it involves, and by extension the more people will need to be involved to solve it properly. Bypassing this means bypassing critical context and insight, and potentially making very grave mistakes in the solutions you create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply put that's the critical gap between a Senior and a Staff engineer, but that's a story for another day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point of this is that without a plan and systems of communication, organization, networking, and other methods of managing all that context you end up with chaos. A ship without a rudder sailing aimlessly into the distance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That might work well for the short term, but direction becomes critical if you want to do anything beyond floating in a loosely forward direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this all brings up a very interesting question: how does someone with Autism / ADHD, both conditions known for not being great at all of the above, manage to survive past those levels?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-contradictory-existence"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A Contradictory Existence
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone with Autism I like things to make sense, to have a natural order, and to fall into the right place. My life is dominated in many ways by a desire for order and rigor. Take me to any restaurant and I guarantee I'll order the same thing every time, and most of the owners will know me by name if I've lived somewhere for any decent amount of time. Consistency brings me peace of mind, and helps me to focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can imagine that 2020 and 2021 were not kind on that note, but again, a story for another day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contradictorily and very ironically being ADHD means that my mind works in a state of disorder. I bounce between 10 ideas at any given time, find new hobbies everywhere, and can't focus to save my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two traits are at constant odds with each other in my head. In many cases it feels like I humor myself between the two of them depending on which trait dominates on a given day. Do I need to snap out of an obsession from my Autistic nature, or do I need to drill down and focus on one task and quit being capricious from my ADHD nature?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#systems-of-order"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Systems of Order
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is that I use them both against each other, where one is weak I supplement the other's strength. I create systems of order in which I can succeed with ADHD, via calendars, notes, reminders, and anything else I can get a hold of to keep myself accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have collections of notes spanning many years capturing insights, networks, communications, and more to make sure I can find the right people when I need to to get critical context. I create systems by which to capture and distill that information into useful documents, and further methods to distill that information into actionable content and executive summaries to inform those above me on a path forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simple truth is I do not trust myself to be responsible, so any system of order I make is explicitly to keep myself accountable to a task. Being autistic I find great comfort in order and certainty, in rote and repetition of tasks, which means I'm very good at creating order of chaos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's interesting about that statement is the reverse: To get good at creating order of chaos, one has to be able to live in chaos and thrive in it first. ADHD's lack of a clear focal point and its tendency for capriciousness benefits me in that I'm far more comfortable with disorder and chaos than many without it. After all, my head works like that, even if I do like order more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The critical point is that I can recognize chaos for what it is, and in doing so start to implement systems of order on top of it to facilitate progress. The larger the chaos the more this ability shines, but there are certainly dangers in forms of chaos that I cannot comprehend nor manage, so knowing my limit is critical in stepping back and consulting others first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's more interesting is that these systems of order allow something else entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-cost-of-freedom"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Cost of Freedom
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through systems of order balancing chaos, I'm allowed a certain freedom of execution. I've created a solid foundation in which I can experiment, do as I will, and explore beyond scopes I may have been able to more early in my career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was much younger I did not have such systems of order, yet I yearned for freedom. Freedom to play, to explore, to do what I wanted to do. Many times, when given such freedom, it would be my undoing. If anything seeking freedom was what about got me fired in a few roles in the past, as I did not have nearly the support structure I needed to execute upon it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By creating systems of order that can sustain me, and networks by which I can execute through, I'm able to create greater freedoms by which myself and others can pursue tasks as we wish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The irony, and the cost of that freedom, are systems of organization to prevent chaos beyond our ability to manage from eroding our foundation and putting us in positions where tasks are quite literally impossible to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know, I've put myself in that position several times before, and it's not fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, it was probably those very experiences that gave me the critical insight that there's a high cost to freedom, and the higher one goes and the wider scope that one executes at that cost grows with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider a manager who creates systems of organization through Jira or Agile methodologies (it could be anything though, those are just examples). Through that newer engineers can execute tasks to move the team forward, but inside that framework they have the freedom to add tasks and propose new solutions, all because the team is still moving forward due to the manager's planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That manager shields the team from chaos beyond their scope of view, and in doing so gives them the freedom to execute in their own scope. Of course as team members level up they'll become privy to far more of the chaos the team is wrapped up in, but preferably only when they're ready to face it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extrapolate this to directors, department heads, GMs, VPs, C-levels, and more and you can see that the costs of organizing at each progressive level grow exponentially, but the freedom and clarity they provide by doing so to those under them grows with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's a pretty amazing power, and one I hope to have one day, but one I have a lot of work to do to get to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#superpower-or-curse"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Superpower or Curse?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I exist in a world somewhere between chaos and order, creating order of chaos, and living a life that allows me to survive chaos perhaps beyond what would otherwise be normal. While this may sound like some form of superpower, it's far more a precarious balancing act, and if I happen to slip and let one side dominate it does not end well for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I let my Autistic nature dominate, I'll begin to lock down and go back to the familiar. Anything outside of that box won't happen, and I'll likely be like that for a week or two while I regain my composure. I start to jettison anything and everything not necessary to finish existing commitments, and will very much be in a state of Autistic burnout. Recovery from that is painful, and frequently I try and take a vacation when I find myself flirting too much with that line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I let my ADHD nature dominate I'll get nothing done. I'll be on an endorphin hunt looking for anything and everything that can give me just a bit of a rush. Whether that be shopping, smells, foods, experiences, new comics, books, games, or any of the above I want something to make me feel whole and "happy" again, despite that being impossible. ADHD burnout means that I'll be on a perpetual hunt for a new high, until I detox my mind and get back to a normal state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know me personally you'll notice that I have routines, whether that be coffee or food, that I tend to adhere to to satisfy my Autistic nature. You'll also notice the tendency of me pursuing new and novel hobbies on occasion, but in very limited quantities, to satisfy my ADHD nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't ignore them, but neither can I let them win and dominate my life, which brings up the question if this is a superpower or a curse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really though? It depends on the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#closing-thoughts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Closing Thoughts
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I grow in my career my permanent fear is that I encounter chaos beyond my capacity requiring order that tips me beyond my limits. Thankfully I've had the support of many wise friends, mentors, elders, and family to guide me through those times. People who have been there, and seen the tops of the mountains I'm climbing, and that's made all the difference in the world. To even know it's possible, and that my ideals aren't wrong, is more valuable than gold to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there's one final lesson I could impart from this article it's that you're not in this alone, not now and not ever. There will be things beyond us, but there will also be people there with an outstretched hand if you look for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are not alone, not in the greatest chaos, nor in the most thorough systems of order we could imagine. Alone we will fail, but together we can achieve so much more, and that's a lesson I wish I had learned much earlier in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Migrating and Configuring Eslint in Angular 11</title>
      <author>Tarun Gurang</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 19 Nov 2021 10:03:24 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/tarungurang/migrating-and-configuring-eslint-in-angular-11-251i</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/tarungurang/migrating-and-configuring-eslint-in-angular-11-251i</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the earlier version, Angular implements the linting with TSLint but with Angular 11 announced that the TSLint linting replaced with the ESLint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#usage-with-nx-monorepos"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Usage with Nx Monorepos
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nx leans for some, but not for all packages from this project. It does not use the builder to execute ESLint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#packages-included-in-this-project"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Packages included in this Project
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following packages are included in your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;@angular-eslint/builder:This package is used to execute ESLint in your project using standard commands such as ng lint.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;@angular-eslint/eslint-plugin: This is the ESLint specific package that contains some specific rules that are specific for the Angular projects. It can be combined with other ESLint packages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;@angular-eslint/template-parser: This is the ESLint specific parser package that allows you to written the custom ESLint rules in your Angular template.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;@angular-eslint/eslint-plugin-template:This package is used in conjunction with @angular-eslint/template-parser which allows template specific rules to run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;@angular-eslint/schematics: This package is used to add and update the configuration files that are running on the Angular template.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#migrating-an-angular-cli-project"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Migrating an Angular CLI project
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Add the dependencies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do the migration, run the schematic package to add the @angular-eslint into your project.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ng add @angular-eslint/schematics

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After running this command, it will install the packages and add the packages in the package.json file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{

    "@typescript-eslint/parser": "4.3.0"
  }
}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More: &lt;a href="https://www.ifourtechnolab.com/blog/what-s-new-in-angular-11"&gt;What’s New In Angular 11?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 2: Run the eslint schematic on a project&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, you can choose the project that you want to migrate. The following command can run the eslint schematic.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ng g @angular-eslint/schematic:convert-tslint-to-eslint {{ Your project name }}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After running this command, eslintrc.json will be created. Let’s take a look at the configuration that was generated from the above command.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  "root": true,
  "ignorePatterns": [
    "projects/**/*"
  ],
  "overrides": [
    {
      "files": [
        "*.ts"
      ],
      "parserOptions": {
        "project": [
          "tsconfig.json",
          "e2e/tsconfig.json"
        ],
        "createDefaultProgram": true
      },
      "extends": [
        "plugin:@angular-eslint/ng-cli-compat",
        "plugin:@angular-eslint/ng-cli-compat--formatting-add-on",
        "plugin:@angular-eslint/template/process-inline-templates"
      ],
      "rules": {
        "@angular-eslint/component-selector": [
          "error",
          {
            "type": "element",
            "prefix": "app",
            "style": "kebab-case"
          }
        ],
        "@angular-eslint/directive-selector": [
          "error",
          {
            "type": "attribute",
            "prefix": "app",
            "style": "camelCase"
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "files": [
        "*.html"
      ],
      "extends": [
        "plugin:@angular-eslint/template/recommended"
      ],
      "rules": {}
    }
  ]
}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notice that the configuration is inside in the overrides field because the Angular project has the HTML files and typescript files. We can avoid the conflicts using the ESLint overrides field that allows us to separate rules for different file types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above configuration, we can see the configuration of the @angular-eslint plugin:@angular-eslint/ng-cli-compat and @angular-eslint/ng-cli-compat--formatting-add-on. These two configurations are used for the automatic matching of TSLint rules and ESLint rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;env: What to include in a linting and what version to be used in your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;extends: What packages will be extended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;parser: What parser to be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;parserOptions: The Project setting for typescript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#changing-the-configuration"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Changing the configuration
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To change the configuration, first we will remove both plugins plugin:@angular-eslint/ng-cli-compat and plugin:@angular-eslint/ng-cli-compat--formatting-add-on from the extends field. After that we can add the plugin of the plugin:@angular-eslint/recommended in the extends field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s see the updated configuration file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  "root": true,
  "ignorePatterns": [
    "projects/**/*"
  ],
  "overrides": [
    {
      "files": [
        "*.ts"
      ],
      "parserOptions": {
        "project": [
          "tsconfig.json",
          "e2e/tsconfig.json"
        ],
        "createDefaultProgram": true
      },
      "extends": [
        "plugin:@angular-eslint/recommended",
        "plugin:@angular-eslint/template/process-inline-templates"
      ],
      "rules": {
        "@angular-eslint/component-selector": [
          "error",
          {
            "type": "element",
            "prefix": "app",
            "style": "kebab-case"
          }
        ],
        "@angular-eslint/directive-selector": [
          "error",
          {
            "type": "attribute",
            "prefix": "app",
            "style": "camelCase"
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "files": [
        "*.html"
      ],
      "extends": [
        "plugin:@angular-eslint/template/recommended"
      ],
      "rules": {}
    }
  ]
}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The plugin:@angular-eslint/recommended plugin is used to disable some conflicting rules of the eslint:recommended for usage with the typescript and add the typescript rules. There are another configuration adding in the extends field and the configuration looks like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;"extends": [
        "plugin:@angular-eslint/recommended",
        "eslint:recommended",
        "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended",
        "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-requiring-type-checking",
        "plugin:@angular-eslint/template/process-inline-templates"
      ],

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the above configuration, the order of the included plugins matters. If we have included plugin typescript-recommended before the eslint:recommended then the conflicting rules will be enabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#adding-prettier"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Adding Prettier
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prettier is used for detecting and automatically fixing the styling issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Installing the Prettier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be installing the configuration dependencies of the prettier ESLint plugin of the following command:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm i -D prettier eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-config-prettier

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We will install the three configuration dependencies: prettier, eslint-plugin-prettier and eslint-config-prettier. These plugins are needed for fixing the styling but also disabling some styling rules of the ESLint so that there are no conflicts between ESLint and Prettier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking to &lt;a href="https://www.ifourtechnolab.com/hire-angular-js-developer"&gt;hire Angular Developer&lt;/a&gt;? Your Search ends here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrating Prettier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To integrate the prettier plugin, we need to add the plugin to extends field in the .eslintrc.json file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  "root": true,
  "ignorePatterns": [
    "projects/**/*"
  ],
  "overrides": [
    {
      "files": [
        "*.ts"
      ],
      "parserOptions": {
        "project": [
          "tsconfig.json",
          "e2e/tsconfig.json"
        ],
        "createDefaultProgram": true
      },
      "extends": [
        "plugin:@angular-eslint/ng-cli-compat",
        "plugin:@angular-eslint/ng-cli-compat--formatting-add-on",
        "plugin:@angular-eslint/template/process-inline-templates",
        "plugin:prettier/recommended"
      ],
      "rules": {
        "@angular-eslint/component-selector": [
          "error",
          {
            "type": "element",
            "prefix": "app",
            "style": "kebab-case"
          }
        ],
        "@angular-eslint/directive-selector": [
          "error",
          {
            "type": "attribute",
            "prefix": "app",
            "style": "camelCase"
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "files": [
        "*.html"
      ],
      "extends": [
        "plugin:@angular-eslint/template/recommended"
      ],
      "rules": {}
    }
  ]

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you want to enable the styling and formatting in the HTML files, then you need to add the code in the HTML entry of the overrides field.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;"extends": [
        "plugin:@angular-eslint/template/recommended",
        "prettier/@typescript-eslint",
        "plugin:prettier/recommended"
      ],

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the above code, the prettier code is written at the end of the extends array because the prettier config disables the ESLint rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog, we have discussed about ESLint and what packages are included in the project. We saw how to migrate the TSLint project to the ESLint and also learn the installing and integrating of prettier plugin.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So in this week's videos on DevTips Daily, we made a start on our full end to end project mini-series.  We got cracking with the project idea, took a look at writing Agile User Stories and got some boilerplate code setup using the NX CLI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a link to each individual tutorial:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Composer conflict, how can we use it?</title>
      <author>Samuele Lilli</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 19 Nov 2021 09:59:01 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/doncallisto/composer-conflict-how-can-we-use-it-24c2</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/doncallisto/composer-conflict-how-can-we-use-it-24c2</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I found a very useful Composer schema &lt;a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#package-links"&gt;package link&lt;/a&gt; option named &lt;a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#conflict"&gt;&lt;code&gt;conflict&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is useful when third-party code you rely on is too permissive for your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing, the &lt;a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#conflict"&gt;&lt;code&gt;conflict&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#conflict"&gt;man page&lt;/a&gt; states&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lists packages that conflict with this version of this package. They will not be allowed to be installed together with your package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that when specifying ranges like &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;1.0 &amp;gt;=1.1&lt;/code&gt; in a &lt;code&gt;conflict&lt;/code&gt; link, this will state a conflict with all versions that are less than 1.0 &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; equal or newer than 1.1 at the same time, which is probably not what you want. You probably want to go for &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;1.0 || &amp;gt;=1.1&lt;/code&gt; in this case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to explain how we can take advantage of this, we’ll use a concrete example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-problem-with-a-guzzle-dependency"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The problem with a Guzzle dependency
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Madisoft we love open source and believe in its power, not only because we have third-party code on which our application is based upon (BTW, thanks to everyone who makes our daily job easier!), but also because we like to contribute and have a commitment to OSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the packages we use and help improve is &lt;a href="https://github.com/sensiolabs/BehatPageObjectExtension"&gt;BehatPageObjectExtension&lt;/a&gt;, an extension for Behat that incapsulates the &lt;a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/PageObject.html"&gt;PageObject pattern&lt;/a&gt; (we have written a blog post about PageObjectExtension, in Italian, &lt;a href="https://labs.madisoft.it/uso-del-page-object-pattern-con-behat-esempio-pratico/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When looking at this &lt;a href="https://github.com/sensiolabs/BehatPageObjectExtension/pull/128"&gt;pull request&lt;/a&gt; I’ve opened to add PHP 7.4 support to the library, you may notice a &lt;a href="https://travis-ci.org/sensiolabs/BehatPageObjectExtension/builds/624031440?utm_medium=notification&amp;amp;utm_source=github_status"&gt;previous Travis CI build&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://travis-ci.org/sensiolabs/BehatPageObjectExtension/jobs/624031441?utm_medium=notification&amp;amp;utm_source=github_status"&gt;failing test&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasons behind the issue are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sensiolabs/BehatPageObjectExtension/pull/128/files#diff-b5d0ee8c97c7abd7e3fa29b9a27d1780L23"&gt;Dropping support for PHP older versions&lt;/a&gt; (check the PHP supported versions &lt;a href="https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting this change on &lt;a href="https://github.com/sensiolabs/BehatPageObjectExtension/pull/128/files#diff-354f30a63fb0907d4ad57269548329e3"&gt;.travis.yaml&lt;/a&gt; (a file that tells the CI platform how to create the environment to run your tests on)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sensiolabs/BehatPageObjectExtension/pull/128/files#diff-354f30a63fb0907d4ad57269548329e3R6"&gt;Shifting the deps=low flag to the lowest supported PHP version&lt;/a&gt; in order to tell Composer to use the &lt;a href="(https://github.com/sensiolabs/BehatPageObjectExtension/blob/f4613bf3eabc3b6e41d613be60358aae7f56482f/.travis.yml#L13)"&gt;&lt;code&gt;--prefer-lowest&lt;/code&gt; flag when installing the dependencies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Pay attention to last point on the list: when working on OSS, it’s important to try to keep everyone’s code - that depends on your OSS - working (at least until a bump to a major version) so, in sight of this, it’s common to check if the lowest possible dependencies your code accepts will still make the tests pass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we shifted the &lt;code&gt;deps=low&lt;/code&gt; flag to PHP 7.2, we found the above issue. It was already there, but we hadn’t noticed as the flag was only on PHP 7.1, meaning that tests never ran against PHP 7.2 with lowest dependencies. As PHP 7.2 introduced &lt;a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration72.incompatible.php#migration72.incompatible.warn-on-non-countable-types"&gt;a warning on certain &lt;code&gt;count()&lt;/code&gt; usages&lt;/a&gt;, our code didn’t manage to pass the tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you look closely, you’ll probably notice that the warning was not raised by our code directly, but by third-party code we’re requiring with Composer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warning: count(): Parameter must be an array or an object that implements Countable in /home/travis/build/sensiolabs/BehatPageObjectExtension/vendor/guzzlehttp/guzzle/src/Handler/CurlFactory.php line 66&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/1973"&gt;We found the related issue on the Guzzle GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt; and we noticed &lt;a href="https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/1973#issuecomment-350534938"&gt;a fix had been released with version 6.3 of this library&lt;/a&gt;. Hurray, we can bump Guzzle version to 6.3 and overcome the problem! But looking at &lt;a href="https://github.com/sensiolabs/BehatPageObjectExtension/blob/master/composer.json"&gt;BehatPageObjectExtension’s &lt;code&gt;composer.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; we’ve soon realized that Guzzle isn’t a direct dependency managed by us. “It’s not a big deal” I thought as Guzzle was required by Goutte and we require Goutte through &lt;a href="https://github.com/minkphp/MinkGoutteDriver"&gt;its Mink driver&lt;/a&gt;,so I expected to find some tagged version of Goutte and the Mink Driver with this requirements bump. Sadly I found it wasn’t the case &lt;a href="https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/Goutte/blob/v3.2.3/composer.json#L19"&gt;as Guzzle is required in Goutte with &lt;code&gt;^6.0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (so, basically every version between 6 and 7) and this includes the versions with the warning described above. Therefore in our case the warning was displayed as a “side effect” of &lt;code&gt;deps=low&lt;/code&gt; that requires indirectly Guzzle 6.0 as is the lowest dependency accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without discussing if it’s right or wrong to keep a version of third party code that could break everthing (take a look at &lt;a href="https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/Goutte/issues/393"&gt;this PR&lt;/a&gt;), we were suddenly at a crossroads: drop the &lt;code&gt;deps=low&lt;/code&gt; and give up on this kind of tests or dig in the Composer manual and look for something that could possibly help us: you guessed right, &lt;code&gt;conflict&lt;/code&gt; is what we needed (&lt;a href="https://github.com/sensiolabs/BehatPageObjectExtension/pull/128#issuecomment-564910876"&gt;thanks to jakzal!&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sensiolabs/BehatPageObjectExtension/pull/128/files#diff-b5d0ee8c97c7abd7e3fa29b9a27d1780R54-R55"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; are the details of the commit with &lt;code&gt;conflict&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With &lt;code&gt;conflict&lt;/code&gt; you can &lt;em&gt;force&lt;/em&gt; the minimum version of a dependency you cannot control directly, avoiding headaches or third party code forks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this little story helped you to learn something new, personally I did!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy coding!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to avoid accepting third-party code with well-known security issues you can take advantage of &lt;a href="https://github.com/Roave/SecurityAdvisories"&gt;SecurityAdvisories&lt;/a&gt; by Roave, a library which uses &lt;code&gt;conflict&lt;/code&gt; as shown in this article to block unsafe packages. Give it a look!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-guide-on-how-to-use-nextjs-environment-variables"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A guide on how to use Next.js environment variables
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-create-an-environment-variable-for-nextjs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to create an environment variable for Next.js
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#first-create-a-file-with-a-starting-in-raw-env-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  First, create a file with a starting in &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the run-time environment, a custom &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file can be created suce as the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;.env.development&lt;/code&gt; - when running &lt;code&gt;next dev&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;.env.production&lt;/code&gt; - when running &lt;code&gt;next start&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;.env.local&lt;/code&gt; - will override &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.env.development&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;.env.production&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;.env.test&lt;/code&gt; - when running &lt;code&gt;jest&lt;/code&gt; OR &lt;code&gt;cypress&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;host environment variables - AWS, Heroku, Vecel, etc. provide an interface to set environment variables directly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#next-inside-the-created-raw-env-endraw-file-add-the-variables-to-be-used"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Next, inside the created &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file, add the variables to be used
&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;VARIABLE_NAME=VALUE
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This will be accessible via &lt;code&gt;proccess.env&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;VARIABLE_NAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#two-types-of-environment-variables"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Two types of environment variables
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Server-side expose variables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browser exposed variables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-serverside-variables"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Server-side variables
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every variable set in an &lt;code&gt;.env*&lt;/code&gt; file will be available on the server-side. &lt;em&gt;Including the second type&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;DB_HOST=secret_host
DB_USERNAME=username
DB_PASSWORD=password
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Above variables can be used in the server-side code such as &lt;code&gt;getStaticProps&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;getServerSideProps&lt;/code&gt;, or in &lt;code&gt;/api&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getStaticProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;connectToDatabase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;DB_HOST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;DB_USERNAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;DB_PASSWORD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-browser-exposed-variables"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Browser exposed variables
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accessing the sample variables above will yield undefine.&lt;br&gt;
In order to make a variable available to the browser, it should be prepended with &lt;code&gt;NEXT_PULIC_&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS=abcde12345
NEXT_PUBLIC_NOT_SO_SECRET_URL=https://example.com
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even though there will be more keystrokes, I personally like this convention as it gives a clear distinction of what variables are available to the client side.&lt;br&gt;
It is less likely that I will expose any sensitive information to the user.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As per the variables above, it can be used anywhere in React land. For example, setting the Google analytics key.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// _document.tsx&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Another usage is for something publicly accessible but should not be committed to the repo.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;NEXT_PUBLIC_NOT_SO_SECRET_URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although you can still access a browser exposed variable in your server-side code, it will not make sense to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure any sensitive information should not be committed in the repo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next.js provides an easy way to set environment variables in any run-time environment. It also provides a good convention to separate variables that can be used on the client-side.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Understanding Typescript</title>
      <author>Samuel K.M</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 19 Nov 2021 09:34:11 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A JavaScript superset, that builds up on JavaScript language, It adds new features to JavaScript, typescript cant run in the browser or even in NodeJS therefore it has a compiler that  compiles typescript to JavaScript. Added features in typescript include the use of types, it also helps us be more explicit and clearer about our code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets look at two code snippets one with Plain Javascript and another in typescript .&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Plain Javascript&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  let inputA = 1
  let inputB = 2
  function sum(inputA, inputB){
     console.log(inputA + inputB)
  }
  sum(inputA,inputB)
  //this will return 3
  //Now what if we change the inputs to be
  inputA = "1"
  inputB = "2"
  sum(inputA,inputB)
 //this will return 12
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the second answer being wrong, we dont get an error notification at run time. Here is when typescript comes in with its additional type feature that guarantees we get the correct answer or an error.In &lt;code&gt;typescript&lt;/code&gt; this would be written as(you can test this code in the &lt;a href="'https://onecompiler.com/typescript'"&gt;TS playground&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    let inputA = 1
    let inputB = 2
    funtion sum(inputA: number,inputB: number){
     console.log(inputA + inputB)
    }
    sum(inputA,inputB)
    //prints 3
    //Now what if we change the inputs to be
    inputA = "1"
    inputB = "2"
    sum(inputA,inputB)
    //script.ts(6,9): error TS2345: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Through the introduction of types in typescript, it easier to write more intuitive code. I will be writing a series of tutorial on typescript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will cover:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typescript Basics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typescript compiler&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Classes &amp;amp; Interfaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced Typescript features such as Generics &amp;amp; Decorators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay tuned !!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Use react-query hooks in class based components (React.js)</title>
      <author>Govind</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 19 Nov 2021 09:29:54 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/emgk/use-react-query-hooks-in-class-based-components-reactjs-3bno</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/emgk/use-react-query-hooks-in-class-based-components-reactjs-3bno</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few days back, I wanted to implement react-query in one of my old react projects where most of the components were class-based, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React-Query provides hooks to fetch data from API which can be only used inside React Functional components, and it wasn't a good idea to refactor and transform those components into React Functional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#so-how-to-use-them-in-classbased-components"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  So, how to use them in class-based components?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, there are ways available to make hooks available in class-based components, but can be a bit tricky for a newbie. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that case, you can use &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-query-class-component"&gt;react-query-class-component&lt;/a&gt;  npm package (small-sized), it will help you to use react-query hooks in your class-based component, it supports all react-query hooks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-use"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to use?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add this package to your project, run the following command in terminal&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm i react-query-class-component
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then at the top of your component file import following component&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;QueryClientHook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react-query-class-component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;QueryClientHook&lt;/strong&gt; is the component through this you can run react-query hooks in class-based component. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#parameters"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Parameters
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;hook&lt;/strong&gt; (required): react-query hook , eg. useQuery, useQueries etc...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;params&lt;/strong&gt; (required): List of params to be passed in react-query hook mentioned in "hook" param&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;options&lt;/strong&gt; (optional): options for react-query hook
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;QueryClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;QueryClientProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useQuery&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react-query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;QueryClientHook&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;react-query-class-component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;queryClient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;QueryClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;QueryClientProvider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;queryClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;TodoList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/QueryClientProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;TodoList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
