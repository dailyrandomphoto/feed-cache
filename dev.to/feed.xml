&lt;p&gt;Hello Devs, If you want to learn Blockchain in 2022 and looking for best resources to learn Blockchain then you have come to the right place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier, I have shared &lt;a href="https://dev.to/javinpaul/6-best-websites-to-become-a-blockchain-developer-in-2022-3han"&gt;best websites to learn Blockchain in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/best-blockchain-courses-and-certification-in-2020-63729f8f04d0"&gt;best blockchain certifications&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="https://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-blockchain-technology-courses.html"&gt;best free Blockchain courses&lt;/a&gt; and in this article I am going to share the best blockchain courses for beginners to learn in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're involved in the cryptocurrency space then you've probably heard about blockchain. Unless you're living under a rock...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm talking about this new technology that offers what cryptocurrencies were most dangerous about... safety. With blockchain, transaction safety is a must every time. Big companies are investing big stacks of money to find experts in this field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blockchain expert's salary can go as high as $150,000 per year. So yeah, if you were thinking of learning about &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/07/top-5-online-courses-to-learn-blockchain.html"&gt;blockchain&lt;/a&gt;, this is the right time to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1713895&amp;amp;u=880419&amp;amp;m=105464&amp;amp;urllink=&amp;amp;afftrack="&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--suP16yO3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0b/00/0c/0b000cd4a0644af5f6573891461b57ad.png" alt="Blockchain Risk Assessment and Enterprise Management Framework | 101  Blockchains | Blockchain, Blockchain cryptocurrency, Blockchain technology" width="880" height="879"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  5 Best courses to learn Blockchain technology in 2022
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn Blockchain but wondering where to start then don't worry, I am going to share with you the 5 best online cures you can join to learn Blockchain in 2022. These are truly the best courses from sites like Udemy, 101 Blockchain, Coursera, and many others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep reading to find out the best courses that will provide you with solid knowledge about blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-certified-enterprise-blockchain-professional-cebp"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. &lt;a href="https://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1713885&amp;amp;u=880419&amp;amp;m=105464&amp;amp;urllink=&amp;amp;afftrack="&gt;Certified Enterprise Blockchain Professional&lt;/a&gt; (CEBP)
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most popular Blockchain certifications from 101 Blockchain, a site specialized in quality Blockchain training material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an action-based course for those who want to learn not just what is blockchain and basics are but also go one step ahead and want to learn how to approach Blockchain implementation. This course will teach you how to do that with actional tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also one of the most complete courses I found on Blockchain as it does not just cover Blockchain basics and implementation but also different Blockchain networks like Ethereum and the use of Blockchain in the real world, particularly in the finance industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a 4-week program, provided you spend 3 to 4 hours each week but it's completely flexible and you can learn as per your convenience and schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of cost, this is a bit costly especially if you compare that to Udemy and Coursera courses but it's worth it. It will cost you around $397 to enroll in the program but you can also use my code BCHAIN30 to gain a 30% discount, especially for javarevisited readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the link to join this program - &lt;a href="https://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1713885&amp;amp;u=880419&amp;amp;m=105464&amp;amp;urllink=&amp;amp;afftrack="&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certified Enterprise Blockchain Professional&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1713885&amp;amp;u=880419&amp;amp;m=105464&amp;amp;urllink=&amp;amp;afftrack="&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QeUfhdzk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8gjv2XGlyfA/YbXWTAJAY4I/AAAAAAAAqg8/6q6yjOuSe8Ul6w2kFpe-i_hbxl9tAnFFgCNcBGAsYHQ/w471-h228/image.png" alt="5 Best Courses to learn Blockchain in 2022" width="471" height="227"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People say that this course is the best one you can find out there. Blockchain isn't the only thing you'll learn in it. It comes from Udemy by the way and it has more than 76,000 students as we speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High school level mathematics, as well as basic python knowledge, are required in order to watch the course. The python part can get a bit boring but don't worry because the course is overall exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So by taking this course you'll learn stuff like how to build a blockchain and why is it important, the theory behind cryptocurrency transactions, blockchains, and smart contracts, and how to create your own currency and smart contract. Pretty awesome right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part is that many colossal companies like Apple and Volkswagen, use this course to educate their employees on the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only will you transform from a novice to a blockchain expert but you'll also get the required tech instincts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you're a college student looking to make your own crypto &amp;amp; blockchain career or someone that is just fascinated by this whole thing, the "Blockchain A-Z: Learn how to build your first blockchain" course is the perfect fit for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here is the link to join this course - **&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=CuIbQrBnhiw&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fbuild-your-blockchain-az%2F"&gt;Blockchain A-Z: Learn how to build your first blockchain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=CuIbQrBnhiw&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fbuild-your-blockchain-az%2F"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9D3zTF86--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WqiqqfY6OKPbG_CPsf9CCxDlBfh1LapbvoCL6QGCEc6X2__H5TpSt3WI-fMFCt5W0573KGLuBt4pO4kINlZ7K28ozhyrf22Nl7gEX1lUq-Vk2vHs7S_Wy4hURPkPrAfAvBiRDpxz%3Dw520-h251" alt="best Blockchain course for Beginners" width="519" height="251"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-blockchain-specialization"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=40328&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fspecializations%2Fblockchain"&gt;Blockchain Specialization&lt;/a&gt;**
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And let's close this up with a Coursera blockchain course. In the Blockchain Specialization course, Bina Ramamurthy will teach you the Next Frontier in IT. More specifically, you'll learn to understand smart contracts, you'll get a core idea of blockchain that enables automation, autonomy, scalability, and transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that's not all of it. You'll also learn how to design and program smart contracts and decentralized applications. And the best of them all... after you finish the course, you'll be able to think of innovative application models, leveraging blockchain technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll learn to work on the Ethereum blockchain platform as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course is offered by The State Univeristy of New York and the University of Buffalo. The course is ideal for programmers and designers involved in developing and implementing blockchain applications, and anyone who is interested in understanding its potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, you can either join this specialization individually, or you can also join the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=40328&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fcourseraplus"&gt;Coursera Plus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a subscription plan from Coursera which gives you unlimited access to their most popular courses, specialization, professional certificate, and guided projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=40328&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fspecializations%2Fblockchain"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--20UfHpxq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Anzcdr_vL6rcKRhrcOmlnkORxg9KTeT0vGyUshrAAuzc8K5bCvQ7V2mZRMxhG5iwsFHGZ_7LVV91mhw4lnhmEJVNvzxAqOJOSXx742MZpBf2UH6y0OG9pNFTrX1qNeFs6LWkUSWz%3Dw551-h224" alt="best Blockchain Certification for beginners" width="551" height="224"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  4 . &lt;a href="https://www.educative.io/courses/hands-on-blockchain-hyperledger-fabric?affiliate_id=5073518643380224"&gt;Become a blockchain developer&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course is different because it's the only Educative course on this list. But why is that important? Because Educative is an online learning platform that allows you to run code in the browser and learn along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the course, it's one of the most complete courses you'll find out there. People with No experience can easily take it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course starts with basic cryptography in order to build a good understanding of the blockchain and its value. Then, you will explore the Hyperledger Fabric technology by IBM. This is where the Educative features will come in handy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parts of this course are: deploy your own blockchain network, deploy chain code on it and create an application that invokes your chain code running in fabric network as well as learn to manage fabric user identities in your application using wallets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Educative with its amazing software will help you reach the expertise level you need in order to find success.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, you can either join this course individually or you can get an &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.educative.io/subscription?affiliate_id=5073518643380224"&gt;Educative Unlimited&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; subscription (recommended) to get access to their 250+ high quality, text-based, interactive courses to learn key skills for coding interviews, software development, and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.educative.io/courses/hands-on-blockchain-hyperledger-fabric?affiliate_id=5073518643380224"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---qqwzIkY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/2p8ZqxqmqK-0Q0-49bU_hlsnk7ZBiRGS6sCkmUZN6J0YVSrSB5C-MEh8U9NC1blZ6ltlWl2xtv5Vj2ajYcLtm99N_W-TIBEtXAWaGRSavrlBz3Da7oLQDnY2CcuPDbfFjDQPXRhY%3Dw504-h252" alt="best Educative course to learn Blockchain" width="504" height="252"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-learning-blockchain-development-with-eos-and-c"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=CuIbQrBnhiw&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Flearning-blockchain-development-with-eos-and-cpp%2F"&gt;Learning Blockchain Development with EOS and C++&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course is also crazy helpful but it's a bit different from the previous one. This one is more specialized. There are no general speaking things that you can easily find online. Everything provided in this course is of insane value and only experts know it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of experts, the program's instructor is Jackson Kelly. Jackson Kelly is a software engineer currently working for Amazon. I think that Amazon only hires the best of them so further explanation is not necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll learn about EOS, how to design and deploy smart contracts to the EOS blockchain, how to deploy your own token to the EOS blockchain, how to airdrop tokens, and how to set up an IDE with EOS. Of course, that's not all of it. I'm just providing you with an outline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main things that this course aims to achieve is to teach you how to build production-ready apps with EOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're a programmer looking to leverage your blockchain knowledge or an engineer who wants to understand EOS and how to build dApps with it, then the "Learning Blockchain Development with EOS and C++" is a really good choice for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Here is the link to join this course - *&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=CuIbQrBnhiw&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Flearning-blockchain-development-with-eos-and-cpp%2F"&gt;Learning Blockchain Development with EOS and C++&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=CuIbQrBnhiw&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Flearning-blockchain-development-with-eos-and-cpp%2F"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8WFdLYtd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9_Xl09qIcgbfib7BJYemwsriHKGL5z72Xjes1hz85IxeRzkSQzcnYyT-DCn2Wveuw2h9rkBJso89ZhNbsJo4_GA4-hjvccuGK3g89fkh44Xey13Eg4uwR82wq-U3eAelyex5eCY2%3Dw446-h336" alt="best online course to learn Blockchain with C++" width="446" height="336"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  6. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=CuIbQrBnhiw&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide%2F"&gt;Ethereum and Solidity: The Complete Developer's Guide&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might understand from the tile, this course is all about Ethereum and Solidity. Concepts that are closely related to the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't worry if you don't know what these terms mean. Because I'll try to give you a very simple explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethereum is a cryptocurrency. One of the most famous ones. In value, it's the second most expensive cryptocurrency in the world. After Bitcoin of course. If you've invested in cryptos before, you certainly know of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In simple words, [Solidity] is a programming language for writing smart contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the key takeaways are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Design, test, and deploy smart contracts, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  building compelling blockchain applications using the &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2021/11/top-5-courses-to-learn-ethereum-for.html"&gt;Ethereum Blockchain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Learning the true purpose and capabilities of Ethereum and Solidity, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  and Seeing practical examples to comprehend what blockchain and mining are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A windows/mac/Linux device is necessary as well as basic knowledge of Javascript and NPM. It should be mentioned that this is another bestseller course with over 78,000 students as we speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Here is the link to join this course *&lt;/em&gt;- &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=CuIbQrBnhiw&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide%2F"&gt;Ethereum and Solidity: The Complete Developer's Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=CuIbQrBnhiw&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide%2F"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--x1joe2Bx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/W87G7rcjsF9CydK5L_67Z1hXU_aZ42IXooy8sKIHWNFdwFGOQBRaKN_RxEwtNYQebeX1eVGHafYKB9LqIOOEZzDATjX7p4TPfpS_u833H-QxSgmKKFBbAYrrAG-7RO01EBiiFL-c%3Dw421-h237" alt="best Udemy course to learn Blockchain and Solidity" width="421" height="237"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's all about how to learn Blockchain in 2022. These were the best blockchain courses you can find out there. Each of them is better at something specific and overall these courses are capable of turning you into a blockchain expert in a matter of weeks or even days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to start your career as a Blockchain developer in 2022, I highly recommend you to join one of these courses, and if you are really determined, go for a Blockchain certification like the &lt;a href="https://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1713885&amp;amp;u=880419&amp;amp;m=105464&amp;amp;urllink=&amp;amp;afftrack="&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certified Enterprise Blockchain Professional&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by 101 Blockchains to move ahead from the competition.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Q. 1: What is Serialization in Laravel?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's similar to turning an object into JSON, but with the advantage that PHP will remember the native data type of each serialized item (string, array, integer, float, boolean).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PHP and Javascript can only communicate via strings. You can pass the string "foo" very easily to Javascript. You can pass the number 1 very easily to Javascript. You can pass the boolean values true and false easily to Javascript. But how do you pass this array to Javascript?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is serialization. In case of PHP/Javascript, JSON is actually the better serialization format:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**echo json_encode($array)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How-to Use Static Stability to Design a Resilient Architecture</title>
      <author>Gert Leenders</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 08:26:49 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/aws-heroes/how-to-use-static-stability-to-design-a-resilient-architecture-17p9</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/aws-heroes/how-to-use-static-stability-to-design-a-resilient-architecture-17p9</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Very recently, while browsing some online AWS documentation, I landed on a page about &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/static-stability-using-availability-zones/"&gt;Static stability using Availability Zones&lt;/a&gt;. Although that page had nothing to do with what I was looking after, I found the title quite intriguing. I had never heard about the concept before. Triggered, I decided to read the paper. It turned out to be one of the more interesting papers I've read in a while. The remainder of this post is a brief rehash of the paper, focussed on the core concept and supplemented with my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Important note: although the paper originates from AWS, the concepts are not limited to the AWS Ecosystem but are broadly applicable in system design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#before-we-start"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Before we start
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because static stability is all about resilience, I need once more to rant a little on the importance of &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/disaster-recovery-dr-objectives.html"&gt;RTO and RPO&lt;/a&gt; first. I find it hard to understand that sometimes systems are being designed without knowing their recovery objectives. It seems impossible to make a great design without knowing these. A design that doesn't consider the recovery objectives from the start will inevitably result in over-or underengineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always sort out the recovery objectives first before starting a system design!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-static-stability"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Static Stability?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a statically stable design, the overall system keeps working even when a dependency becomes impaired.&lt;/strong&gt; Perhaps the system doesn’t see any updated information that its dependency was supposed to have delivered. &lt;strong&gt;However, everything it was doing before the dependency became impaired continues to work despite the impaired dependency.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we drill further down, we first need to talk about Availability Zones, because on AWS, availability zones are a main pillar of statically stable designs. Therefore a quick refresher of the definition of an Availably Zone: &lt;strong&gt;"an Availability Zone is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity in an AWS Region".&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over the years, when building systems on top of Availability Zones, AWS has learned to be ready for impairments before they happen&lt;/strong&gt;. A less effective approach might be to deploy to multiple Availability Zones with the expectation that, should there be an impairment within one Availability Zone, the service will scale up in other Availability Zones and be restored to full health. &lt;strong&gt;This approach is less effective because it relies on reacting to impairments as they happen, rather than being prepared for those impairments before they happen. In other words, it lacks static stability.&lt;/strong&gt; In contrast, a more effective, statically stable service would over-provision its infrastructure to the point where it would continue operating correctly without having to launch anything new, even if an Availability Zone were to become impaired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, understanding static stability itself is only half the story. To properly apply the pattern to a system design, you need to understand a second concept: control and data planes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NlBsqkF4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f0thpbk6ujd78k58ygwa.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NlBsqkF4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f0thpbk6ujd78k58ygwa.jpeg" alt="Control Plane" width="880" height="471"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-a-control-and-data-plane"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is a Control and Data plane?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A control plane is the machinery involved in making changes to a system&lt;/strong&gt; (adding resources, deleting resources, modifying resources) and getting those changes propagated to wherever they need to go to take effect. &lt;strong&gt;A data plane, in contrast, is the daily business of those resources, that is, what it takes for them to function.&lt;/strong&gt; Furthermore, It's crucial to understand that the data plane is usually far simpler than its control plane. &lt;strong&gt;As a result of its relative simplicity, a data plane is much better suited for targeting a higher availability than a control plane.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#putting-it-all-together"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Putting it all together
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#separate-systems-along-the-control-and-data-plane-boundary"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Separate systems along the control and data plane boundary
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concepts of control planes, data planes, and static stability are broadly applicable in various system designs. Suppose you're able to decompose a system into its control plane and data plane. In that case, it might be a helpful conceptual tool for designing highly available services for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's typical for the availability of the data plane to be even more critical to the success of the customers of a service than the control plane.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's typical for the data plane to operate at a higher volume (often by orders of magnitude) than its control plane. Thus, it's better to keep them separate so that each can be scaled according to its own relevant scaling dimensions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AWS found over the years that a system's control plane tends to have more moving parts than its data plane, so it's statistically more likely to become impaired for that reason alone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting those considerations altogether, it seems a best practice to separate systems along the control and data plane boundary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let's zoom in on some examples of Static Stable Designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#design-1-static-stability-using-an-activeactive-setup-on-availability-zones"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Design 1: Static Stability using an Active-Active setup on Availability Zones
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common example of an active-active design on AZ's is a load-balanced HTTPS service. The diagram below shows a public-facing Load Balancer providing an HTTPS service. The load balancer's target is an Auto Scaling group that spans three Availability Zones. This is an example of active-active high availability using Availability Zones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--phPmyfMe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zbj33szscxvfobxd8dl0.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--phPmyfMe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zbj33szscxvfobxd8dl0.png" alt="Active-Active setup" width="880" height="494"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the event of an Availability Zone impairment, this design requires no action.&lt;/strong&gt; The instances in the impaired Availability Zone will start failing health checks, and the Load Balancer will shift traffic away from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#design-2-static-stability-using-an-activestandby-on-availability-zones"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Design 2: Static Stability using an Active-standby on Availability Zones
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next diagram shows an Amazon RDS database. In this case, the RDS database setup spans multiple Availability Zones. In a multi-AZ setup Amazon RDS puts the standby candidate in a different Availability Zone from the primary node. In this setup, when the Availability Zone with the primary node becomes impaired, the stateful service does nothing with the infrastructure. In the background, RDS will manage the failover and then repoint the DNS name to the new primary in the working Availability Zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HnJDuFzw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/10pacbzzpgjx4fc0acxd.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HnJDuFzw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/10pacbzzpgjx4fc0acxd.png" alt="Active-standby" width="880" height="494"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These two patterns have in common that both of them had already provisioned the capacity they’d need in the event of an Availability Zone impairment well in advance of any actual impairment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-principle-of-independent-availability-zones"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The principle of independent Availability Zones
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A third way to use the principle of independent Availability Zones is to design a packet flow to stay within an Availability Zone rather than crossing boundaries.&lt;/strong&gt; Keeping network traffic local to the Availability Zone is worth exploring in more detail. The following diagram illustrates a highly available external service, shown in orange, that depends on another, internal service, shown in green. A straightforward design treats both of these services as consumers of independent EC2 Availability Zones. &lt;br&gt;
Each of the orange and green services is fronted by a Load Balancer, and each service has a well-provisioned fleet of backend hosts spread across three Availability Zones. One highly available regional service calls another highly available regional service. This is a simple design, and for many of the services we’ve built, it's a good design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q-hJ4MsL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/54dnrwqyck3m2q6yi83y.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q-hJ4MsL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/54dnrwqyck3m2q6yi83y.png" alt="HA Service" width="880" height="494"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suppose, however, that the green service is a foundational service. That is, suppose it is intended not only to be highly available but also, itself, to serve as a building block for providing Availability Zone independence. In that case, you might instead design it as three instances of a zone-local service, on which we follow Availability Zone-aware deployment practices.&lt;/strong&gt; The following diagram illustrates the design in which a highly available regional service calls a highly available zonal service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IvvDxdpc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/if3zjau9c9mj1ty38mgl.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IvvDxdpc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/if3zjau9c9mj1ty38mgl.png" alt="Zone local" width="880" height="494"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasons to design a building-block service to be Availability Zone independent comes down to simple arithmetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a system where one highly available regional service calls another highly available regional service and a request is sent through the system, then with some simplifying assumptions, the chance of the request avoiding the impaired Availability Zone is 2/3 * 2/3 = 4/9. That is, the request has worse than even odds of steering clear of the event.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In contrast, if you built the green service to be a zonal service&lt;/strong&gt;, then the hosts in the orange service can call the green endpoint in the same Availability Zone. With this architecture, &lt;strong&gt;the chances of avoiding the impaired Availability Zone are 2/3&lt;/strong&gt;. If N services are a part of this call path, then these numbers generalize to (2/3)^N for N regional services versus remaining constant at 2/3 for N zonal services!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed reading about the concept of static stability and the principles of independent AZ's as much as I did. 😉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kudos to &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/authors/becky-weiss/"&gt;Becky Weiss&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/authors/mike-furr/"&gt;Mike Furr&lt;/a&gt; as the authors of the ordinal AWS paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until next time!&lt;/p&gt;

  Introduction:
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Composer was inspired by projects like NPM and Bundler.  Dependencies save you time and energy. Functionalities you may need for your app like sending e-mails or logging can all be easily included as third party libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Composer is an exceptional dependency manager for PHP. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vast selection of compatible packages are hosted on the official Composer repository called Packagist. These packages are open source so you can contribute to them too. Popular frameworks and tools like Laravel, PHPUnit and Monolog can all be found here.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post we'll discuss about the &lt;code&gt;flushSync&lt;/code&gt; utility provided by &lt;code&gt;react-dom&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's try and understand what &lt;code&gt;flushSync&lt;/code&gt; is and how it can useful through an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, it's a simple todo example but the point to note here is that the todo container has fixed height and is scrollable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, there's our &lt;code&gt;App&lt;/code&gt; component that has a &lt;code&gt;todos&lt;/code&gt; state and returns a list of todos along with a form.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;todos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTodos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;mockTodos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onAdd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;newTask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTodos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;todos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;uuid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;task&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;newTask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}]);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;section&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"app"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Todos&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;overflowY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;todos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;todo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;todo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;todo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;task&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;AddTodo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;onAdd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;onAdd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;AddTodo&lt;/code&gt; component is also fairly simple, it just manages the input state and once the form is submitted it calls the &lt;code&gt;onAdd&lt;/code&gt; prop with the new todo.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AddTodo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onAdd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;taskInput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTaskInput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleSubmit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;preventDefault&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;taskInput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;trim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTaskInput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onAdd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;taskInput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;trim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;onSubmit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleSubmit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"text"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;placeholder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Your Task"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;taskInput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;onChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTaskInput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Add Task&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now that we've an understanding of how our code works, suppose we want to add a functionality where every time a new todo is added, the container is scrolled to its bottom so that the newly added todo is visible to the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think for while and figure out how you would go about implementing this functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#using-raw-useeffect-endraw-hook"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Using &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; hook
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you might be thinking of using the effect hook. Every time the &lt;code&gt;todos&lt;/code&gt; change just scroll the container to the bottom.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;listRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;scrollTop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;listRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;scrollHeight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// listRef is simply a ref attached to the ul&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;todos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;OR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;lastTodo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;listRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;lastElementChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;lastTodo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;scrollIntoView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;todos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both of these work fine but you might want to you use the &lt;code&gt;useLayoutEffect&lt;/code&gt; hook in this situation in case you observe any jitters in scrolling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, I would not want to put this in either of these hooks because I feel that more than a side effect, it actually should be a part of the &lt;code&gt;onAdd&lt;/code&gt; handler itself. So, let's try and do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#scrolling-logic-inside-the-handler"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Scrolling logic inside the handler
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you simply put the scrolling logic inside the handler (as shown below), you would notice that you're not exactly getting the desired results.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onAdd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;newTask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTodos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;todos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;uuid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;task&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;newTask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}]);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;lastTodo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;listRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;lastElementChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;lastTodo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;scrollIntoView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because &lt;code&gt;setTodos&lt;/code&gt; is not synchronous, what happens is you scroll first and then the &lt;code&gt;todos&lt;/code&gt; actually get updated. So, what's in view is not the last todo but second to last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, to get it working as expected we would have to make sure that the logic for scrolling runs only after the &lt;code&gt;todos&lt;/code&gt; state has been updated. And that's where &lt;code&gt;flushSync&lt;/code&gt; comes handy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#using-raw-flushsync-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Using &lt;code&gt;flushSync&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use &lt;code&gt;flushSync&lt;/code&gt;, we need to import it from &lt;code&gt;react-dom&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;import { flushSync } from "react-dom";&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now we can wrap the &lt;code&gt;setTodos&lt;/code&gt; call inside &lt;code&gt;flushSync&lt;/code&gt; handler (as shown below).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onAdd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;newTask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;flushSync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTodos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;todos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;uuid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;task&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;newTask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}]);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;lastTodo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;listRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;lastElementChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;lastTodo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;scrollIntoView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now we have made sure that the state update happens synchronously and the logic for scrolling is executed only after the state has been updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/react-flush-sync-bo1in"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it for this post, let me know situations where you would want to use &lt;code&gt;flushSync&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peace ✌&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While you can generate QR codes for URLs in browsers such as Chrome it's always interesting to learn how you can make your own version of a simple QR code generator. Here we go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#html"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  HTML
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a quick look at the HTML code and it's pretty straightforward.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;section&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"heading"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"title"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;QRcodes&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"sub-title"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Generate QRCode for anything!&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;section&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"user-input"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;for=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"input_text"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Type something...&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"text"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"input_text"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"input_text"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;autocomplete=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"off"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"button"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"submit"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Generate QR Code&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"qr-code"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;style=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"display: none;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"./js/app.js"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The last element is for the QR code to be displayed as soon as we fetch it from a library through javascript (more on that later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's move on to some javascript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#javascript"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  JavaScript
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, we will create an event for when the user clicks on the &lt;code&gt;Generate QR code&lt;/code&gt; button.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;btn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;btn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//code&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now, we are going to create a function known as &lt;code&gt;generate()&lt;/code&gt; which will be invoked as soon as the user clicks on the &lt;code&gt;Generate QR code&lt;/code&gt; button. This function will take the text input from the user as a parameter.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;generate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user_input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//code&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Inside this function, we are going to use a javascript library &lt;a href="https://davidshimjs.github.io/qrcodejs/"&gt;qrcode.js&lt;/a&gt; to generate QR code. You can use this library via a CDN by including the below &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag in the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag of &lt;code&gt;html&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/qrcodejs/1.0.0/qrcode.min.js"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Inside the &lt;code&gt;generate()&lt;/code&gt; function, we will create a new object using the given library. It will take two arguments, first is the element in which the QR code has to be displayed and secondly, the content for which the QR code has to be generated and some options to customize the QR code.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;generate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user_input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;qrcode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;QRCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.qr-code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user_input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;180&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//default 128&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;180&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;colorDark&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;#000000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;colorLight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;#ffffff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;correctLevel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;QRCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;CorrectLevel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Next, we will create a download button and append it below the QR code.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;download&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.qr-code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;download&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Inside this download button we will add a link which allows users to download the QR code with a specified file name and append it into the download button. You  can &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#attr-download"&gt;learn more about the download attribute here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;download_link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;download_link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;download&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;qr_code_linq.png&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;download_link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerText&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Download&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;download&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;download_link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Let's figure out the &lt;code&gt;href&lt;/code&gt; attribute of the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;qrcode&lt;/code&gt; object will return a &lt;code&gt;canvas&lt;/code&gt; element as well as an &lt;code&gt;image&lt;/code&gt; element. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For smartphones, the &lt;code&gt;canvas&lt;/code&gt; element will be visible but for desktop, the &lt;code&gt;image&lt;/code&gt; element will be visible having a &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; attribute set to a &lt;code&gt;dataURL&lt;/code&gt;. We will use the &lt;code&gt;dataURL&lt;/code&gt; to download the QR code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of desktop, it's pretty obvious. We just have to grab the value of &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; attribute of the image element and assign it to the &lt;code&gt;href&lt;/code&gt; attribute of the download link (&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag) after a specified amount of time (0.3 seconds) using &lt;code&gt;setTimeout()&lt;/code&gt; function because the QR code takes some time to be generated.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;download_link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.qr-code img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;300&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But how do we get the &lt;code&gt;dataURL&lt;/code&gt; from the canvas element? By using the method &lt;code&gt;toDataURL()&lt;/code&gt; on the &lt;code&gt;canvas&lt;/code&gt; element.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;download_link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.qr-code img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;300&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After applying some logic, we get this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.qr-code img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;download_link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;canvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toDataURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;300&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;download_link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.qr-code img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;300&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Also, the &lt;code&gt;.qr-code&lt;/code&gt; element will be hidden until the user clicks on the &lt;code&gt;Generate QR code&lt;/code&gt; button. With this, our &lt;code&gt;generate()&lt;/code&gt; function is all set to be invoked.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;generate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user_input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.qr-code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;qrcode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;QRCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.qr-code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user_input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;180&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//128&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;180&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;colorDark&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;#000000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;colorLight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;#ffffff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;correctLevel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;QRCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;CorrectLevel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;qrcode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;download&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.qr-code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;download&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;download_link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;download_link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;download&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;qr_code_linq.png&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;download_link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerText&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Download&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;download&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;download_link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.qr-code img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;download_link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;canvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toDataURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;300&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;download_link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.qr-code img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;300&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now inside our click event function, we will check if there is already a QR code displayed or not. If it is, then we will first clear that QR code and generate a new one. If it's not present, we can simply generate a new one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, all of this happens only if the user enters some text or if the input value is not empty.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;btn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user_input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;#input_text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user_input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.qr-code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;childElementCount&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;generate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user_input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.qr-code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerHTML&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;generate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user_input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.qr-code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;display: none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;not valid input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can style the elements the way as you want. Here are the styles that I went for:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;62.5%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;box-sizing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;border-box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="py"&gt;text-size-adjust&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;-webkit-text-size-adjust&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:hover&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;cursor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;pointer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;flex-direction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;column&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;align-items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#EAE6E5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.heading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;a href="#choosing-container-orchestration"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Choosing container orchestration
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you re-platform your application, you can select a container orchestrator that is most&lt;br&gt;
suitable for your requirements. 80% of all containers in the cloud run on AWS, and you have a broad set of options to run and manage your containers on AWS. When choosing your container orchestration option, you should start with the question, “How much of the container infrastructure do I want to manage?” The following options are available to you:&lt;br&gt;
• &lt;strong&gt;Self-Managed Containers on&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/"&gt;Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(Amazon EC2)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
— EC2 virtual machines give you full control of your server clusters and provide a broad range of customization options. You can choose Amazon EC2 to run your container orchestration if you need server-level control over the installation,configuration, and management of your container orchestration environment.&lt;br&gt;
• &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/"&gt;Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(Amazon EKS)&lt;/strong&gt; — Amazon EKS is a managed service that makes it easy for you to run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install and operate your own Kubernetes control plane or worker nodes.&lt;br&gt;
Amazon EKS provisions and scales the Kubernetes control plane, including the API servers and backend persistence layer, across multiple AWS &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-availability-zones"&gt;Availability Zones&lt;/a&gt; for high availability and fault tolerance. Amazon EKS integrated with various AWS services such as Elastic Load Balancing, AWS Identity and Access Management&lt;br&gt;
(AWS IAM), Amazon VPC, and &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/"&gt;AWS CloudTrail&lt;/a&gt; to provide scalability and security for your applications.&lt;br&gt;
• &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/"&gt;Amazon Elastic Container Service&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(Amazon ECS)&lt;/strong&gt; — Amazon ECS is a highly scalable, high-performance container management service that supports Docker&lt;br&gt;
containers and enables you to run applications on a managed cluster of Amazon EC2 instances. With simple API calls, you can launch and stop container-enabled applications, query the complete state of your cluster, and access many familiar features like security groups, Elastic Load Balancing, EBS volumes, and IAM roles.You can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across your cluster based on your resource needs and availability requirements.Amazon Web Services Modernize .NET Applications with Linux Containers&lt;br&gt;
• &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/"&gt;AWS Fargate&lt;/a&gt; — AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that works with both Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS. AWS Fargate removes the need to provision and manage servers and enables you to specify and pay for resources per application. AWS Fargate is the easiest way to get started with containers on AWS. With AWS Fargate, developers don’t have to manage the underlying infrastructure and they can launch and scale their containers easily and manage everything at the container level. This guide uses AWS Fargate for ECS to deploy&lt;br&gt;
containerized .NET Framework applications on AWS.The next section covers some of the tools and libraries that are available to you as you build your .NET applications and DevOps automation on AWS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tools and libraries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
AWS has many tools available for developers and IT practitioners to build and run container applications and infrastructure. The following table covers some of the primary tools that are useful for the refactoring and replatforming process. You’ll use many of&lt;br&gt;
these tools later on in the Walkthrough section of the guide. For the latest news and releases, visit the &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/developer/language/net/"&gt;.NET on AWS landing page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aws-container-services"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AWS container services
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several cost aspects to consider when running applications on AWS. These include, but are not limited to, storage, data transfer, service usage, compute, and operations. This guide focuses on compute (where the containers run) and operations cost (staffing) of managing the compute resources. To simplify the analysis, it does not include the cost of running a database in the example.&lt;br&gt;
As mentioned, there are four different services that AWS provides to run containerbased applications: Amazon EC2, Amazon EKS, Amazon ECS, and AWS Fargate. To understand the cost implications of running containers on each of these services, this paper reviews an example of a simple application architecture, and compares the cost of running it on each service with an On-Demand pricing model in the us-east-1 Region.As detailed previously, you could choose a different pricing structure such as Spot Instances or Saving Plans, which are supported for the services covered in this guide.The examples in the following sections were generated by the &lt;a href="https://calculator.aws/#/estimate?id=962adcc4611ed94c0aef310846f355dc2b247ba9"&gt;AWS Pricing Calculator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
As the baseline for the comparison, this paper uses an application running on Windows in Amazon EC2, as shown in the following figure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--933F-i8I--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mdwrs7otvus68rnlhqya.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--933F-i8I--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mdwrs7otvus68rnlhqya.JPG" alt="Image description" width="749" height="538"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#selfmanaged-containers-on-amazon-ec2"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Self-managed containers on Amazon EC2
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running containers on Amazon EC2 gives you the highest level of control over the underlying compute, but it comes with the highest TCO, because you must manage theentirety of the container’s lifecycle. Additionally, you are responsible for optimally&lt;br&gt;
utilizing the underlying compute, rather than leaving this to the managed container orchestrator. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#amazon-eks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Amazon EKS
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Amazon EKS, you pay $0.10 per hour for each cluster that you create. You can use a single Amazon EKS cluster to run multiple applications by taking advantage of Kubernetes namespaces and IAM security policies. You can run Amazon EKS on AWS using either Amazon EC2 or AWS Fargate, and on-premises using &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/outposts/"&gt;AWS Outposts&lt;/a&gt; or&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/eks-anywhere/"&gt;Amazon EKS Anywhere&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are using Amazon EC2 (including with Amazon EKS-managed node groups), you pay for AWS resources (such as EC2 instances or EBS volumes) you create to run your Kubernetes worker nodes. You pay only for what you use, as you use it; there are no minimum fees and no upfront commitments.&lt;br&gt;
The calculations in this guide use Amazon EC2 for compute. For more details on Amazon EKS pricing, see the &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/pricing/"&gt;Amazon EKS pricing page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#amazon-ecs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Amazon ECS
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Amazon ECS, there is no additional charge for the cluster management. You can run Amazon ECS on AWS using either Amazon EC2 or AWS Fargate, and on-premises using AWS Outposts or Amazon ECS Anywhere. Again, you only pay for what you use, as you use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the calculations in this guide, we used EC2 for compute, and for more details on ECS pricing reference the &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/pricing/"&gt;Amazon ECS pricing page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aws-fargate"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AWS Fargate
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS Fargate can be used to run containers on Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS, removing the operational cost of managing the underlying infrastructure yourself. Pricing is calculated based on the vCPU and memory resources used from the time you start to download your container image until the Amazon ECS Task or Amazon EKS Pod ends,&lt;br&gt;
rounded up to the nearest second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For simplicity, this guide assumes that AWS Fargate will run all the time (730 hours per month), but ideally you benefit more from AWS Fargate when cluster utilization falls under certain thresholds. Windows containers are not supported to run on AWS Fargate at this time. Therefore this paper estimates only the cost of running Linux containers. See the &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/pricing/"&gt;AWS Fargate pricing page&lt;/a&gt; for more information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#architecture-overview"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Architecture overview
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s common for enterprise applications built in the last decade to follow a layered &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture"&gt;N-Tier&lt;/a&gt; architectural approach. The unctionally for different aspects of the application are logically separated, yet bundled together as interdependent code modules.&lt;br&gt;
There are multiple advantages of an N-Tier architecture. They’re easy to develop, more feasible to test if the application size is small, and can scale vertically. However, as more functionality is added and the code base grows, the applications become&lt;br&gt;
cumbersome to manage, change, and scale. State-dependent applications are particularly difficult to scale horizontally, and the compute capacity must be provisioned to consider the peak load.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4HOGiqN4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qz2g0ateomi8rhiuwt6r.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4HOGiqN4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qz2g0ateomi8rhiuwt6r.JPG" alt="Image description" width="768" height="454"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many customers start their cloud journey with a lift-and-shift approach, running their NTier .NET Framework applications on EC2 without any code changes. It’s common for these deployments to have more than one EC2 Windows instance with an &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/application-load-balancer/"&gt;Application Load Balancer (ALB)&lt;/a&gt;, routing the user requests to one of the EC2 instances. A stateful application can have session affinity (sticky sessions) enabled at the ALB level to create an affinity between a client and a specific EC2 instance.&lt;br&gt;
Along with the ALB, developers can use AWS Auto Scaling to monitor an application and automatically adjust capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost. &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/sqlserver/"&gt;Amazon RDS for SQL Server&lt;/a&gt; is a managed database service that&lt;br&gt;
frees you up to focus on application development by managing time-consuming database administration tasks, including provisioning, backups, software patching,monitoring, and hardware scaling.&lt;br&gt;
This guide refactors this traditional N-Tier .NET Framework application to run on Amazon ECS with AWS Fargate. As mentioned in the previous sections, running containers on Amazon EC2 and Amazon EKS is also an option, but using Amazon ECS and AWS Fargate is a simple yet powerful place to start if you and your teams are new&lt;br&gt;
to containers.&lt;br&gt;
Fargate integrates natively with AWS services such as Application Load Balancer and &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/"&gt;AWS Auto Scaling&lt;/a&gt;, enabling developers to start with the minimum amount of compute to meet user requirements and scale dynamically as the incoming traffic increases. The high-level architecture for the containerized version of this application follows, and is the target of the transformation detailed in this guide. In the following figure, the one vCPU,&lt;br&gt;
two GB blocks represent the AWS Fargate tasks where the application containers are running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RDkSuFqk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jtd7p8ty1bbpay73irrn.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RDkSuFqk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jtd7p8ty1bbpay73irrn.JPG" alt="Image description" width="801" height="464"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional benefits of moving to containers are realized when teams also implement automation and DevOps. A cloud-optimized, containerized application allows you toquickly and frequently deliver consistent applications to your users. A common&lt;br&gt;
development pipeline for continuous deployment with AWS follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--P-xMR8k9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oz5sfo097wokzgjiitg6.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--P-xMR8k9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oz5sfo097wokzgjiitg6.JPG" alt="Image description" width="796" height="463"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A11y tips: let the user control the zoom</title>
      <author>Carlos Espada</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 07:26:22 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/carlosespada/a11y-tips-let-the-user-control-the-zoom-2p86</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/carlosespada/a11y-tips-let-the-user-control-the-zoom-2p86</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When we define a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;meta name="viewport"&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; there are two parameters that we can use that affect accessibility:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;user-scalable="no"&lt;/code&gt;: disables browser zoom on a web page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;maximum-scale&lt;/code&gt;: limits the amount the user can zoom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both are problematic for users with low vision who rely on browser zoom to see the contents of a web page. &lt;strong&gt;It is better not to define them and to leave complete freedom to the user&lt;/strong&gt; to manage the zoom as needed when visiting our website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore the ideal definition is:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;meta
  name="viewport"
  content="width=device-width, initial-scale= 1"
/&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Or even not define any &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;meta name="viewport"&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, like &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; does. But please don't do like &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OpQKxmvp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pq9l656zg5jgkfrg4gv1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OpQKxmvp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pq9l656zg5jgkfrg4gv1.png" alt="Capture of the HTML code of Instagram, in which the meta name viewport is highlighted with several parameters that disable the possibility of zooming" width="880" height="197"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a perfect example of how not to use &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;meta name="viewport" /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How ML, AI, AR, and Chatbots Attract Buyers to Your E-Commerce Store</title>
      <author>Emerline</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 07:22:16 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/emerlinedev/how-ml-ai-ar-and-chatbots-attract-buyers-to-your-e-commerce-store-1j6g</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/emerlinedev/how-ml-ai-ar-and-chatbots-attract-buyers-to-your-e-commerce-store-1j6g</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We live in a time when innovations develop with remarkable speed and become available more than ever before. Meanwhile, the world situation pushes them forward, making businesses adopt innovative technologies to survive in the competitive market, and e-commerce is no exception. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current world situation with the COVID-19 outbreak, which caused isolation measures and quarantine, is another crucial driver for the adoption of advanced technological solutions by the e-commerce industry. And in this article, we’ll take a close look at how such innovations as AI and ML, AR, and chatbots help businesses to remain competitive at the hardest of times. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s not beat around the bush and start exploring their impact on the shopping experience and business development. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ml-and-ai-technology-in-ecommerce"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ML and AI technology in eCommerce
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advance of technologies today allows businesses to go beyond addressing real-world issues, covering such complicated and hard-to-measure things like customer satisfaction. And because the COVID-19 outbreak has led to the highest rates of technology adoption for e-commerce purposes, it is predicted that by 2025, AI and ML technologies will control about 95% of all customer interactions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because AI and ML are known for helping e-commerce companies with the personalization of services, the use of these technologies leads to increased sales. The growth in sales becomes possible with a product recommendation based on a user's browsing history and buying patterns.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's more, AI and ML allow industry players to invent new strategies of communication with customers and keep them engaged. And with the extremely accurate data produced by AI and ML, it becomes possible to enhance the existing strategies, whether the talk is about personalized replies to customer inquiries, tailored alerts on shopping deals, or reminders on the created wish lists. Also, these technologies perfectly align with successful strategies for finding new customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ML and AI in E-Commerce: Examples and Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So let’s dig deep into how AI and ML are revolutionizing the e-commerce industry. Here are the major use cases of these techs:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iUHQcvdt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2uxxzao7fsdldwpx5nbe.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iUHQcvdt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2uxxzao7fsdldwpx5nbe.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="483"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Chatbots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chatbots allow e-commerce platforms to automate interactions with customers, also adding to more personalized experiences, whether with the help of textual or auditory methods. To be more exact, these are exactly chatbots that allow e-commerce stores to provide 24x7 assistance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important thing to mention here is that these bots not just help with customer queries, but also positively affect buying decisions of users, contributing to the clarity and better navigation on websites with lots of products on offer.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more advantage chatbots have on offer is the ability to gather customer input, analyze it, and provide valuable info for better decisions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll get back to chatbots later to view this technology and its beneficial impact on business. And now, let’s explore the next brilliant use case of AI and ML in e-commerce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hyperlocal ecommerce&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We live in a time when hyperlocal commerce is on the rise: it's widely used by e-commerce businesses for the creation of multiple sub-stores under customer geo-location data, in this way allowing to carter the unique needs of every individual customer group. This contributes to a better shopping experience and faster delivery of goods - both highly valued issues. Moreover, hyperlocal commerce serves as a booster to sales by offering bestsellers to users based on the local demand analysis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Headless commerce&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Used for the delivery of a sound content experience and efficient management of the functionality, headless commerce serves as a good add-in to an e-commerce solution. It can be used by a variety of e-commerce business lines, whether brands that place a focus on the delivery of experiences, companies selling lifestyle products, brands that promote with influencers, etc. - applied as a part of business strategy, it allows creating seamless and personalized shopping experience, unique brand identity, and delivery of customized services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Localized content&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Localized content is a powerful tool in e-commerce that allows businesses to reach wider audiences without any hindrance of location or language. The thing is that multilingual e-commerce solutions allow automatically translating a website into hundreds of languages, just in a few clicks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning will continue to assist e-commerce businesses in the areas of website and app optimization, customer experience, personalized services, customer relationship management, warehousing management, etc. Since AI and ML keep evolving, they will continue to benefit the e-commerce industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But AI and ML are not the only contributors to the efficiency of e-commerce. So now, let’s see what’s the impact of Augmented Reality on the sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ar-technology-in-ecommerce"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AR technology in eCommerce
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of augmented reality in e-commerce solutions gives consumers an immersive experience, allowing them to have real-time interaction with products while remaining in their own environment. An example of such a solution is the AR Shopping App Designed by Emerline for Driving Shoe Sales. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AR bridges the gap between physical stores and online shopping experiences. This gap is felt even wider due to the Covid-19 pandemic that restricts retail shops from being open and leaves consumers unable to enter stores and physically handle products. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how exactly does AR help e-commerce businesses to survive in this complicated period?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brilliant Use Cases of AR in E-Commerce&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
While various researches highlight how augmented reality can not only increase engagement but also have a significant impact on conversions for e-commerce brands, Deloitte has gone one step further by claiming that 40% of shoppers would even pay more for a product if they were able to test it through AR technology. And here are some brilliant examples of how an e-commerce business can benefit from the use of AR today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L’oreal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LeZZoNhG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sbgrcet2bp5q3o4ggzsk.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LeZZoNhG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sbgrcet2bp5q3o4ggzsk.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="514"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
L’Oreal is not just one of the leading players in the beauty industry but also one of the Beauty Tech companies in the world. L'oreal has undergone a digital transformation that resulted in the delivery of augmented products and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the company acquired AR try-on technology known as ModiFace, it witnesses acceleration of sales, and highly increased conversion rates. The technology has literally transformed the consumer experience, allowing users to try on virtual makeup and hair color. But things didn't end there. In addition, AR opened up space for skin diagnosis and skin shade assessments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The adoption of innovation by the company ensured its strong position during the COVID-19 outbreak. The 2020 annual report by L’Oreal states that the beauty company saw a ‘remarkable development’. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DFS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The leading sofa retailer in the UK with more than a hundred showrooms has launched the largest web-based AR solution in 2020, and after the implementation has reaped outstanding results. By offering their customers an opportunity to try on more than 10 thousand sofas and see how they fit their homes, the retailer easily survived the crisis caused by the pandemic. To be exact, the use of AR and 3D technology allow the company to not just keep but increase the conversion rates up to 112% in December 2020. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ASOS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ASOS, an e-commerce retailer with over 22.3 million active customers and more than 85000 products on offer, accelerated the use of AR technology during the Covid-19 pandemic to eliminate the need in shooting products in a studio. In collaboration with Zeekit, the company took advantage of AR to simulate real-life photography of more than 500 products on different models each week. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Hp2zjmWn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jnwp3ok9rokvh2lb6vf0.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Hp2zjmWn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jnwp3ok9rokvh2lb6vf0.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="617"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The conclusion we can make after viewing these brilliant examples of AR use in e-commerce is that the technology allows bringing the desired level of satisfaction with the shopping experience even when it takes place at home, or anywhere else. But it’s always possible to make it even greater. For example, with the use of chatbots. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#leveraging-chatbots-to-ecommerce-stores"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Leveraging Chatbots to E-Commerce Stores
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need for e-commerce chatbots has never been higher than it is today. In fact, McKinsey states that 5 years of digital technology adoption by customers and businesses occurred in just 8 weeks of COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Are The Top Use Cases for eCommerce Chatbots?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
eCommerce companies can leverage chatbots to streamline the entire customer journey. Here are our favorite use cases:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XYVfagUf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6ljthvx5mlw85yrwp8gb.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XYVfagUf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6ljthvx5mlw85yrwp8gb.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="490"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Immediate responses to common customer service FAQs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customer service chatbots are considered to be one of the most widespread use cases for AI, and the e-commerce sector is no exception. They cover a range of issues, from product care and return policies to warranty information and troubleshooting. Providing immediate answers to common questions, e-commerce chatbots significantly save a user's time, which makes this technology highly wanted and beneficial to business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal shopping and product discovery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI-powered chatbots define customer preferences and generate personal product recommendations. They also become a number one solution during the holiday shopping season, helping users to find the perfect gift for everyone based on price range, interests, and other criteria. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conversational commerce&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chatbots are known for providing a seamless add-to-cart and checkout experience that takes place during a conversation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Return prevention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies show that over 30% of all online purchases are returned. So, when a user shows behavior that indicates a return is likely to take place, a chatbot can preemptively intervene to prevent a return from ever happening. For example, a user can add two same items in the cart but in different sizes, and a chatbot can intervene to help in choosing the right size. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Order management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human agents should not be involved in such mundane tasks as making small changes to an order or tracking the status of delivery because it is costly and often results in wait times, longer resolution times, and increased customer frustration. So chatbots can serve as an assistant to the completion of such tasks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-bottom-line"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Bottom Line
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for some advanced technologies to implement in your e-commerce business, the above-mentioned innovations that redefine online shopping while providing a fantastic experience for both buyers and sellers can become a good choice. Whether it is the use of AI and ML, chatbot development, or AR implementation, our R&amp;amp;D (Research and Development) teams will help you to make sure that the solution you are interested in is capable of bringing the desired results.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="#1-get-all-involved-aligned-and-committed"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1 - Get All Involved, Aligned, and Committed
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kUsqCZ3X--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ph0stw7h39988osmh8hb.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kUsqCZ3X--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ph0stw7h39988osmh8hb.jpg" alt="Get All Involved, Aligned, and Committed" width="800" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fundament of an excellent solution architecture is to &lt;br&gt;
understand the problem holistically. It means understanding all stakeholders’ requirements, all constraints, and formulate the essence of a system that solves the problem in total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution architect must also set up a collaboration framework to consider, debate, and determine the solution concepts. Close communication with the key stakeholders is essential since agile development offers opportunities to adjust the solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He analyzes the risks and costs, monitors the quality, and keeps an eye on time planning and resources with the product owner or project manager.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-scope-simplify-and-structure-the-problem"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2 - Scope, Simplify, and Structure the Problem
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---nTn5lg7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h9ys2dd2ak8clh0evlzz.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---nTn5lg7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h9ys2dd2ak8clh0evlzz.jpg" alt="Scope, Simplify, and Structure the Problem" width="800" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, the solution’s scope must be clear, which helps to focus on the essential parts and avoids spending time on unnecessary topics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be clear about what the solution will cover (and what’s out of scope).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution architect slices the problem into relevant parts to identify processes and functions and transform them into a manageable solution component model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simplifying and structuring is key.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An essential point of the solution architects’ work – besides the “pure translation” from functions and processes into technology – is to draw a picture of the envisioned solution, so every stakeholder understands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Big Picture of the solution helps to fight for the same thing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-select-and-evaluate-the-key-technologies"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3 - Select and Evaluate the Key Technologies
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6lb5B-Zq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xdeqkoch1yptfatbd4ce.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6lb5B-Zq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xdeqkoch1yptfatbd4ce.jpg" alt="Select and Evaluate the Key Technologies" width="800" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An essential part of a solution architect’s work is to choose and evaluate the best fitting technologies the solution runs. One step here might be creating a prototype for a proof-of-concept to validate the technology regarding different aspects like performance, stability, and scalability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, he advises the technology stack covering the entire end-to-end perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, the solution architect identifies the potential cost of the environments, significantly what the monthly fee is for operating the solution after go-live.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-consider-solution-design-principles-and-architecture-design-pattern"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4 - Consider Solution Design Principles and Architecture Design Pattern
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XlHpqS8d--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c5dwxp7h5pjzzzuewcpy.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XlHpqS8d--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c5dwxp7h5pjzzzuewcpy.jpg" alt="Consider Solution Design Principles and Architecture Design Pattern" width="800" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like a professional craftsman, the solution architect utilizes guides, tools, and best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of Architecture Design Patterns already published across the internet, covering different aspects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, some examples of cloud-specific patterns (see in detail in &lt;a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/cloud-architecture-patterns/9781449357979/"&gt;Bill Wilder’s book “Cloud Architecture Patterns” at O’Reilly’s&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Horizontally Scaling Compute Pattern – providing more instances of one service in parallel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colocate Pattern – deploying components that work together in the same region/data center&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CDN Pattern – Distribute content across the internet in regions close to the user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot more, also “traditional” patterns like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Client/Server – one service provides data, the other one consumes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microservice – a (web) service which covers the aspects of a single business domain with dedicated data storage and clearly defined interfaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MVC – separation of a user interface application into model, view, and controller logic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the patterns, the solution architect applies solution design principles like the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scalability – a solution must be capable of (dynamically) increasing itself according to the demand (Horizontal or vertical scaling)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security – a solution must be secure regarding the communication between components, data in rest, accessibility of service administration, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resiliency – a solution must be capable of being stable also at times of intensive load and can recover from exceptional states&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fail-Over Capability – a solution must be able to continue working even if instances of components are not available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Single Point of Failure – it must be clear which components are crucial to mitigate potential risks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accessibility, Availability – a solution must be deployed as close as possible to the users (low latency) and must guarantee a high up-time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-comply-with-nonfunctional-requirements"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5 - Comply with Non-Functional Requirements
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bClfHN1I--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h04m7zuy1gf1cjt4ownc.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bClfHN1I--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h04m7zuy1gf1cjt4ownc.jpg" alt="Comply with Non-Functional Requirements" width="800" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the functional requirements, there are several other things the solution architect is considering for the solution listed as follows (examples):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cost Optimization – finding the perfect mix of technologies and infrastructure to solve the problem, and to spend a minimum of money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User Experience – supporting the UX team to find the ideal user interface, guiding users intuitively through the solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quality Assurance – support with (automated) testing of the solution’s components to deliver high-quality applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance – support with load testing to ensure the expected number of concurrent users and client services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-consider-staging-environments-and-enterprise-architecture"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6 - Consider Staging Environments and Enterprise Architecture
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--k7avvSSj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tlu8i6s2zstfx4xcp4w0.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--k7avvSSj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tlu8i6s2zstfx4xcp4w0.jpg" alt="Consider Staging Environments and Enterprise Architecture" width="800" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution architect advises the staging concept and the required technology fundament in dev, test, ref, and prod environment.&lt;br&gt;
Also, supporting the introduction of continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) might be essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He considers the enterprise services in the on-premise data center, mainly applications about data exchange, identity management, and handling regulatory requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the processes, the solution architect considers the interfaces of enterprise applications the solution needs to communicate and give advice for the integration to the development team.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#summary"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the responsibilities mentioned here are the essence of my personal experience and opinion and reflect best practice guides from other solution architects. In case you believe this article can help others sharpen their focus, or reflect themselves, feel free to share it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you again in the next chapter!&lt;/p&gt;
