      <guid>https://dev.to/sophiekaelin/why-is-learning-to-code-so-hard-2921</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A comment I’ve heard from many people is :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve tried to learn coding so many times, but it never seems to click.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this something you’ve said in the past? Don’t worry, you are definitely not alone. Having taught multiple introductory programming classes before, I’ve noticed this is a sentiment shared by a lot of newly starting developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning to code is hard. And while it is true that some people find it easier to learn programming in comparison to others (whether due to higher levels of interest or an aptitude for logical/mathematical reasoning), the way someone goes about teaching themselves to code will impact the likelihood of them developing and retaining those skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very tempting, as it is when learning all new skills, to jump straight into creating the cool things. Like crocheting a jumper, or baking a twelve story croquembouche. It is important to differentiate between your end goal (what you want to build), and what you need to know/learn in order to meet that goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with that, there are various skills you should develop that will aid you in tackling any blockers or errors you may face when completing a project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article I will be discussing my top tips I’ve shared with hundreds of past students that helped them grow in confidence and ability, as well as the tips previous mentors have shared with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-is-it-so-different-to-learning-other-skills"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why is it so different to learning other skills?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning to code is often likened to learning a language or an instrument. So methods such as spaced repetition are regularly recommended to learn new programming languages, just as you would with learning any language. As much as this is a helpful way of learning, it is important to acknowledge the differences between learning a programming language and human language. The main difference being:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no margin for error when writing code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say, for example, you are learning to speak French. You practice your French by making conversation with a fluent French speaker. If you were to mispronounce a word, or jumble up the order of words in a sentence, it is likely the other person will still understand what you were trying to say and a conversation will continue. Unfortunately, a computer does not have that sense of intuition. There is no “close enough” in programming — only right or wrong. That’s what makes it so difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were to ask any person with coding experience, I’m certain they would be able to recall multiple times they were stuck on a silly bug for hours if not days because of a spelling mistake or syntax error. And if they can’t… well they’re lying ! I’ve personally felt the embarrassment of being stuck with broken code for hours, only to realise I wrote “docmuent” instead of “document”, or raged when I couldn’t connect to my server only to realise it was running on port 8888 instead of 888. A human can understand what was meant to be said, but a compiler does not have that ability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--y8Z0x9g7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media3.giphy.com/media/l0MYE0pAvRSSTyRzi/giphy.gif%3Fcid%3Decf05e47xs6sczgevb3eorjiuol1b3uxfrdijbouucr2ua4m%26rid%3Dgiphy.gif%26ct%3Dg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--y8Z0x9g7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media3.giphy.com/media/l0MYE0pAvRSSTyRzi/giphy.gif%3Fcid%3Decf05e47xs6sczgevb3eorjiuol1b3uxfrdijbouucr2ua4m%26rid%3Dgiphy.gif%26ct%3Dg" alt="Facepalm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unforgiving nature of code is what makes it such a difficult thing to learn. It is also the reason why it is vital to develop a handful of important skills that both limit mistakes made, and enable you to solve and debug errors in order to move forward from those mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-skills-should-i-learn"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What skills should I learn?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VrWOTIGc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1581464647110-26e129ce2d02%3Fixid%3DMnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8%26ixlib%3Drb-1.2.1%26auto%3Dformat%26fit%3Dcrop%26w%3D1350%26q%3D80" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VrWOTIGc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1581464647110-26e129ce2d02%3Fixid%3DMnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8%26ixlib%3Drb-1.2.1%26auto%3Dformat%26fit%3Dcrop%26w%3D1350%26q%3D80" alt="Computer"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are trying to learn to code, it is important to first learn the following four things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Core programming concepts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Problem solving strategies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to debug your code and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Core features of your chosen language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#core-programming-concepts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Core Programming Concepts
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is one thing to copy out an answer you saw on &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/"&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;. It is another to understand what you are writing and what it is accomplishing. It is near impossible to learn how to code without first understanding fundamental components that code is made of. Good things to research first are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Variables &amp;amp; Primitive Data Types&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compound Data Types (Strings, Arrays, Lists, HashMaps)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory Allocation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boolean Logic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are various online courses available to teach you these concepts, as well as countless Youtube videos. For the most part, these are transferable skills across different languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Videos by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://thecodingtrain.com/beginners/"&gt;“The Coding Train”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are what I watched when I first started learning. Another great resource is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.codecademy.com/"&gt;“Code Academy”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; if you are looking to challenge yourself and receive feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#problem-solving-strategies"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Problem Solving Strategies
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve got the core concepts down, you should spend some time practicing completing functions to expose yourself to different scenarios and generate your own strategies for how to overcome them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expose yourself to popular &lt;a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/searching-algorithms/"&gt;searching&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sorting-algorithms/"&gt;sorting&lt;/a&gt; algorithms. Practicing implementing well known algorithms will assist you in developing a better understanding of computer science concepts. Plus, the more practice you get, the better you become at problem solving. This may take a bit of time to improve at, but it can also be very fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some fun resources to practice with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/"&gt;Cracking the Coding Interview&lt;/a&gt;: unpacks common questions given in coding interviews.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://codingbat.com/java"&gt;Coding Bat&lt;/a&gt;: I used this all the time when I got started. Getting a gold star next to completed problems also feels super rewarding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://leetcode.com/"&gt;Leet Code&lt;/a&gt;: Another great tool for practicing interview questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/"&gt;Geeks 4 Geeks&lt;/a&gt;: Fantastic write-ups unpacking popular algorithms and core programming concepts. Great for refreshers on topics you may not have visited in a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TLXrdpHM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media2.giphy.com/media/3o7525CnwPAlwoG7qE/giphy.gif%3Fcid%3D790b7611660e78c9a594fef309e5009cf6a8b64e1e4d82cb%26rid%3Dgiphy.gif%26ct%3Dg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TLXrdpHM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media2.giphy.com/media/3o7525CnwPAlwoG7qE/giphy.gif%3Fcid%3D790b7611660e78c9a594fef309e5009cf6a8b64e1e4d82cb%26rid%3Dgiphy.gif%26ct%3Dg" alt="Gold Star"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-debug-your-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to debug your code
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When your code breaks it is important to ask yourself: do I understand what I’ve written? Is this broken because I lack understanding on the topic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Odds are, you will encounter many MANY errors throughout your journey. Experienced programmers still come across various bugs and challenges they need to unpack every day. The difference between experienced and unexperienced developers is that the former have effective strategies on how to debug and unpack issues in their code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to debug your code (especially as a beginner) is to print variables to your console or using debug tools built into the IDE you’re working in. You will gain a better understanding of your code by stepping through it line by line to find the source of your issue. Tracing things in your head can also get super tricky and complex. Try creating memory diagrams and tracing your variables on a piece of paper as you step through code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4kYAT8Jh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media3.giphy.com/media/3owzW5c1tPq63MPmWk/giphy.gif%3Fcid%3Decf05e47u7t4zifl0pix7qqmoz9lktlatxajm7vung9wr8jy%26rid%3Dgiphy.gif%26ct%3Dg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4kYAT8Jh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media3.giphy.com/media/3owzW5c1tPq63MPmWk/giphy.gif%3Fcid%3Decf05e47u7t4zifl0pix7qqmoz9lktlatxajm7vung9wr8jy%26rid%3Dgiphy.gif%26ct%3Dg" alt="Hangover"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more experience you have encountering problems, the better equipped you’ll be with dealing with them in the future. Don’t feel disheartened if you are making a lot of mistakes initially — we all make mistakes, and the learning curve is different for everyone. Take each mistake as a learning opportunity — you’ll be surprised how quickly concepts will come to you later when faced with similar problems&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTaNksV-DPY"&gt;Mike from Code Academy highlights some great debugging strategies to practice when getting started.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#core-features-of-your-language"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Core Features of your Language
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do a bit of research on the language you want to learn. This isn’t exactly a step, but more something you should be doing and learning by default when learning concepts and practicing problem solving. No doubt you will come across various errors and bugs you cannot explain. By researching syntactical standards of the language of your choice you will be able to identify these mistakes earlier. Maybe try and organise a time to chat with someone who has experience with that language and ask for their tips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing to consider is what type of things you are wanting to build. This will impact which language will be the most appropriate to learn. If you are planning to build iOS apps, Swift would be a worthwhile language to consider learning. If you were hoping to build websites, Javascript would be more appropriate. Do your research and ask for advice. There are so many languages and tools out there, it is important to try and find the one with the most appropriate features and functionality to suit your goal product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  * * *
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#extra-tips"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Extra Tips
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get yourself a mentor. There is nothing better than having a person to explain your problems to without fear of feeling stupid. Their support will be invaluable throughout your journey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no indignity in asking for help. I know I keep repeating myself, but mistakes are part of the learning process. It does not make you dumb, it makes you efficient and resourceful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get yourself some buddies. Learning to code is much easier when you are doing it with a group of people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teach someone else. Teaching is one of the best ways of learning, so once you feel comfortable with topics, have a go at teaching someone else what you’ve learnt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start good habits early. Things like naming your variables and functions meaningful things, leaving code comments and using version control. Future you will thank you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take notes. There are resources all over the place, try and collate some notes just for yourself to reference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="http://mattr.net.au/meta/google.html"&gt;Google is not always your friend&lt;/a&gt;. Knowing how and what to search is something that comes with experience. Instead of searching for a solution, search for things to help you better understand your problem so that you can come to your own informed solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy a rubber duck. I’m serious. Tell it all your problems, and in explaining your problem you might answer your own question.
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uBOMDC9Y--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media3.giphy.com/media/3orif4ACshZRKhW6ru/giphy.gif%3Fcid%3Decf05e47t76lq8zcsited7t1y86ykms4tft1f9lnnhug5kyj%26rid%3Dgiphy.gif%26ct%3Dg" alt="Talk in mirror"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is a bit of a stretch goal, but look into testing. It is important to trial how your code responds to a variety of different edge cases to ensure it works the way you think it does.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lastly, and most importantly, don’t expect to know everything straight away! Imposter syndrome is so so common in the computing and engineering community. &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@grace.m.nolan/imposter-syndrome-and-flow-f1628be8ebb4"&gt;My friend Grace wrote an amazing piece on Imposter Syndrome I’d recommend reading.&lt;/a&gt; It is easy to compare yourself to someone who seems to know everything. But try and remind yourself that everyone started somewhere and everyone has been in the position you’re in now. Its a sucky feeling, but if you persist with it and invest the hours, you can be just as knowledgable as your friend with the insanely busy Github profile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best and worst thing about programming is that the learning never stops, and technology continues to evolve and change. Be patient with yourself, set up a study plan, and practice, practice, practice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--82YVnAdS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media0.giphy.com/media/nwyqBwP65XCAU/giphy.gif%3Fcid%3Decf05e47u7ro50ramr9z4clxgeswcwg4t8oeav0wgh40x5zp%26rid%3Dgiphy.gif%26ct%3Dg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--82YVnAdS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media0.giphy.com/media/nwyqBwP65XCAU/giphy.gif%3Fcid%3Decf05e47u7ro50ramr9z4clxgeswcwg4t8oeav0wgh40x5zp%26rid%3Dgiphy.gif%26ct%3Dg" alt="penguin"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Understanding the useReducer hook in React</title>
      <author>Amarjit Singh</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 10 Jul 2021 06:17:16 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/amarjits/understanding-the-usereducer-hook-in-react-4k12</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/amarjits/understanding-the-usereducer-hook-in-react-4k12</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-usereducer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is useReducer?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;useReducer is one of the additional hooks that shipped with React 16.8 . It is an alternative to &lt;code&gt;useState&lt;/code&gt; hook and helps in managing complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one. When combined with &lt;code&gt;useContext&lt;/code&gt; and other hooks, it can be a good alternative to redux.&lt;br&gt;
Also, &lt;code&gt;useReducer&lt;/code&gt; also lets you optimize performance for components that trigger deep updates because you can pass dispatch down instead of callbacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-use-usereducer-hook"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to use useReducer hook?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like any other hook in React, you first need to import it from react.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useReducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, just like the &lt;code&gt;useState&lt;/code&gt; hook, &lt;code&gt;useReducer&lt;/code&gt; hook also returns two things in an Array : the current state value and a &lt;code&gt;dispatch&lt;/code&gt; function to which you can pass an action and invoke later.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useReducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;initialState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We use Array destructuring to get the state and dispatch.&lt;br&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;useReducer&lt;/code&gt; takes two parameters. The first one is the reducer function and second is the initialState. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#reducer-function-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Reducer Function :
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A "reducer" is generally a function that accepts two parameters and returns a single value.&lt;br&gt;
A simple example would be the reducer function that we pass to the &lt;code&gt;reduce()&lt;/code&gt; method in JavaScript.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reducer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;total&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;total&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Reducer function that we pass to &lt;code&gt;useReducer&lt;/code&gt; is also similar.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;initialState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// The reducer function&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;countReducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;switch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;INCREMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;DECREMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;RESET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The reducer function above takes two parameters, first is the current state and second is the action which tells us the operation to be performed. &lt;br&gt;
Here, we have used a &lt;code&gt;Switch&lt;/code&gt; Statement and based on the value of &lt;code&gt;action.type&lt;/code&gt; we perform the corresponding operation on the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dispatching-the-action"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Dispatching the action
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, in order to call the Reducer function to perform an operation on the state we use the &lt;code&gt;dispatch&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Counter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useReducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;countReducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;initialState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;INCREMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;+&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;       &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;DECREMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;       &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;RESET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Reset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When we call the &lt;code&gt;dispatch&lt;/code&gt; function, the current state is automatically passed as the first argument. Therefore, we only pass the action object, which has the type of action we want to perform on the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above example is a basic implementation of useReducer. However, it can be used to perform complex state logic. In that case, both our state and action objects will be a collection of many key value pairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my next blog, I will explain on how to use &lt;code&gt;useReducer&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;useContext&lt;/code&gt; for global state management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you learnt a lot from this blog. Try implementing what you have learnt in your projects. If you enjoyed this post, I’d be very grateful if you’d share it. Comment below if you have any doubts or questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for Reading!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>LikedList Questions: Reverse a Linked List - Recursive version</title>
      <author>Kathan Vakharia</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 10 Jul 2021 05:51:03 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/kathanvakharia/likedlist-questions-reverse-a-linked-list-recursive-version-ige</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/kathanvakharia/likedlist-questions-reverse-a-linked-list-recursive-version-ige</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this series of posts, I will discuss coding questions on the &lt;code&gt;LinkedList&lt;/code&gt; Data structure.&lt;br&gt;
The posts in this series will be organized in the following way,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Question Link ❓&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possible Explanation 📝&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documented C++ Code 🧹&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time and Space Complexity Analysis ⌛🌌&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-question"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Question
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/"&gt;https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;💡 Give yourself at least 15-20 mins to figure out the solution :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#explanation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Explanation
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its bit &lt;strong&gt;tricky&lt;/strong&gt; so pay your atmost attention,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is to make &lt;em&gt;current&lt;/em&gt; node's successor( &lt;code&gt;cur→next&lt;/code&gt; ) point to &lt;em&gt;current&lt;/em&gt; and there by reversing the list. (Here, we are under assumption that the list after current node is already reversed ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we will return the last node's pointer as the new &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; of our reversed linkedlist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the recursion animation to make things more clear, &lt;br&gt;
&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nkxfM3fYaG8"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#c-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  C++ Code
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#definition-of-linked-list"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Definition of Linked List
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight cpp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Definition for singly-linked list.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ListNode&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;val&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;ListNode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;ListNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;val&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;nullptr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;ListNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;val&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;nullptr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;ListNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ListNode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;val&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#solution"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Solution
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight cpp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ListNode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;reverseList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ListNode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/*
        *Approach
            -Let's say list is n0 -&amp;gt; n1 -&amp;gt;... "nk" -&amp;gt; nk+1 -&amp;gt; ...n-&amp;gt;null
            -when we are on nk, we assume nk+1 &amp;lt;-...n i.e. the list ahead is reversed 
        */&lt;/span&gt;

       &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//* When 1. list contains 0 or 1 node, &lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//* 2. head is pointing last node&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;head&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;nullptr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;nullptr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;ListNode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;last&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;reverseList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//note: To make sure this works, we need to make sure:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//&amp;gt; head-&amp;gt;next and head exits (base condition)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//! crux&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;nullptr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;last&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#time-complexity-on"&gt;

  Time Complexity: O(n)

  &lt;/a&gt;
  GraphQL Queries
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting started on GraphQL can look like a lot of effort to learn a new syntax and start integrating with backend and frontend but when you learn that the syntax is very easy and familiar, all there is to do is to just jump in and start your first project with GraphQL&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#fields"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Fields
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fields are the individual data retrieved from the query. Once you have formed the query with fields needed, structure of the data returned follows the same structure as the input which makes it easy to map the fields&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
    user {
        name
        id
        dateofbirth
    }
}

Returns:

{
    "data": {
        "user": {
            "name": "Name 1",
            "id": "uniqueid124",
            "dateofbirth" : "23/10/1995"
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pulling-specific-fields"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Pulling specific fields
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be scenarios where you just want a specific data from a list or fields being transformed based on the business logic of your application. Luckily all the fields can have arguments passed which can simplify the data fetched from the backend and remove the need to have filter logic in the frontend&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the scenario where you have the search filter and each user input is sending a backend api call to your server which filters the list and sends it back. Now you can send the GraphQL query based on the search input and make it easier to display the list in the UI&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
    allusers(name: "nam") {
        name
        dateofbirth
    }
}

Returns:
{
    "data": {
        "allusers": [{
            "name" : "name lastname",
            "dateofbirth": "23/03/1997"
        }. {
            "name" : "name middlename",
            "dateofbirth": "03/07/2003"
        }]
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#fragments"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Fragments
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When building a real world application, we tend to follow standard patterns when displaying similar data throughout the application. Fragment help in following the DRY pattern (Don't Repeat Yourself) when it comes to GraphQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When there is blog site and displaying each blog as a card in your application might follow the same pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="///static/eebf201c1226ca47c78f7eac9b0a6650/4ee7f/post_design.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vOV3RSFA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://eternaldev.com/static/eebf201c1226ca47c78f7eac9b0a6650/4ee7f/post_design.png" alt="Blog Post Design" title="Blog Post Design"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
    mostViewedBlog: blog(id: "1234") {
        ...blogFields
    }
    mostRecentBlog: blog(id: "43243") {
        ...blogFields
    }
    relatedBlog: blog(idL "323") {
        ...blogFields
    }
}

fragment blogFields on Blog {
  name
  description
  image_url
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We have made our query easier to read and also removed repetition in the query using fragment. When declaring the fragment &lt;code&gt;on&lt;/code&gt; keyword defines on which fields you are going to use the fragment. GraphQL then allows to define those fragments on those fields which prevent errors and making sure that fragment fields are present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus:&lt;/strong&gt; Keen observers would have noticied the last query having some name on the left separated by &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt;. Those are aliases and you can use them to rename the result of the field&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Result:
{
    "data": {
        "mostViewedBlog" : {
            "name": "GraphQL Queries",
            "description" : "Description of GraphQL Queries",
            "image_url": "blogimage.png"
        },
        "mostRecentBlog" : {
            "name": "What is GraphQL",
            "description" : "Description of GraphQL",
            "image_url": "blogimage.png"
        },
        "relatedBlog" : {
            "name": "GraphQL Mutation",
            "description" : "Description of GraphQL Mutation",
            "image_url": "blogimage.png"
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

  Practical Exercise
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start learning these concepts better, you can start a quick project in Hasura and learn GraphQL queries by building api of the feed with a search input&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an simple design to spark your creativity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="///static/4434e8f65b2da09f1ca6d80f11fe87d3/9f933/feed_app.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZRYqJJ8Z--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://eternaldev.com/static/4434e8f65b2da09f1ca6d80f11fe87d3/9f933/feed_app.png" alt="Feed app design" title="Feed app design"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are not familiar with Hasura follow this multipart tutorial on how to get started with Hasura&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Binary Search Tree
&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Binary Tree&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each Node contains a key and an optional associated value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allows particularly fast lookup, addition, and removal of items&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#binary-search-tree-node-arrangement"&gt;

  Binary Search Tree ~ Node Arrangement
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The left subtree of a particular node

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contains nodes with keys less than that node’s keys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The right subtree of a particular node

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contains nodes with keys greater than that node’s keys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The right and left subtree, in turn, will also be binary keys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#binary-search-tree-time-complexity"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Binary Search Tree Time Complexity
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In average cases, O(log n) where &lt;strong&gt;_n _&lt;/strong&gt;is the number of nodes in the tree

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insert operation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search operation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deletion operation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In worst cases, O(n) due to tree becoming unbalanced

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insert operation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search operation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deletion operation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  Binary Search Tree Space Complexity
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The space-complexity of a binary tree is O(n) in average and worst case scenarios&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Types of Traversals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#traversals"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Traversals
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pre-order traversal

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visits nodes in Parent-LeftChild-RightChild order&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In-order traversal

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visits nodes in LeftChild-Parent-RightChild order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this way, the tree is traversed in an ascending order of 
keys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post-order traversal

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visits nodes in LeftChild-RightChild-Parent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;bst&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;left&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;recurse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;bst&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;bst&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;right&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;recurse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;bst&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;recurse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;span class="nx"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;BinarySearchTree&lt;/span&gt;

      <title>So what exactly are AWS Nitro Enclaves?</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/oblivious/so-what-exactly-are-aws-nitro-enclaves-11jf</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Secure enclaves and trusted execution environments are becoming ever more popular. AWS recently released their AWS Nitro Enclaves. But what are they and do I really need them?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secure enclaves and trusted execution environments are becoming ever more popular. AWS recently released their AWS Nitro Enclaves. But what are they and do I really need them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nitro enclaves by AWS are Amazon's approach to creating trusted execution environments (TEEs) which are intended to support functions on sensitive data. Amazon by no means invented the concept, and TEEs or secure enclaves have been growing in popularity over the past number of years. Hardware players like Intel and AMD have created physical chips which support TEEs, while cloud platforms like Google and AWS have developed theirs based on virtual machines. The latter is our focus today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assumptions: we're going to assume the reader is familiar with AWS EC2s and Docker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#nitro-enclaves-are-trusted-execution-environments"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Nitro Enclaves are Trusted Execution Environments
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, but how exactly do Nitro Enclaves give trust to their users? Let's start by explaining what exactly they do and then we can dig into how they are useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are familiar with EC2, you are likely familiar with the idea of running a virtual machine. When you spin up an EC2 instance, from your perspective Amazon gives you a server that you can access, configure and run programs on via ssh. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, they don't actually give you a full physical computer (unless you are using a "bare metal" instance) they actually give you a virtual machine (VM) running on a server with other VMs. In essence, they carve out a number of CPUs and some RAM for your virtual machine to use. Their hypervisor runs under the hood and manages the VMs running on each server, providing security and access to the network and PCI devices like GPUs, volume memory, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say you are running an EC2 with 4 cores (CPUs) and 8 GB of RAM, Nitro Enclaves allow you to give back to Amazon 2 cores and 4 GBs of RAM for example. More specifically, you tell AWS to take these resources and run a docker container with them. The docker container can run anything you like, but when you hand it over to Nitro you lose access to it other than a single socket connection using Virtual Sockets. You can't see any internal console messages, logs, anything. Only the input and output of the sockets. Further, only the parent instance (ie the EC2 that created the enclave) can communicate with the docker container running inside the enclave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So basically this is just a worse EC2 instance inside an instance? Not quite. The enclave itself has two superpowers that make it exceptionally useful:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The enclave can speak directly to &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/"&gt;Amazon's KMS&lt;/a&gt; (key management service) over TLS. So if you encrypt data of any kind and the code running inside the enclave needs to decrypt, then it can do so without talking explicitly via the parent instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The enclave creates a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function"&gt;hash&lt;/a&gt; of the docker container (called an attestation) inside the enclave when it communicates to the KMS. This allows you to create access rules within the KMS so only enclaves with a particular hash (ie a specific pre-agreed docker container, running pre-agreed code) get to decrypt data. This can actually be used to talk to custom KMS or equivalent too, proving what's running in the enclave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly neither of these superpowers sounds that impressive at first glance. But give it a minute or two and you begin to see the power it creates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, when we use a KMS we create rules about who can encrypt and decrypt data based on IAM roles in Amazon. Basically, you can say Alice is allowed to encrypt and decrypt data with some key, or the EC2 instance with ID XYZ can use the key and so forth. The problem with this is that you are trusting Alice or the specified EC2 instance to only use the data for a particular use. You don't have any guarantees they will actually do that though. Alice may be malicious and the EC2 you chose may have been corrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also don't really have any reasonable verifiable log of what the data was used for. Perhaps the EC2 is running some code from GitHub, but which version was it running on June 7th, 2020? Not always an easy question to answer. You may have tried to solve this with logs throughout your CI/CD pipeline but you don't actually have any guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you do with Nitro Enclaves because only the version of code (and every other minute detail of how it runs in a docker container) will have the attestation (hash) that is required to decrypt the data using the KMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#so-what-does-this-empower-me-to-do"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  So what does this empower me to do?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two main categories of benefits from Nitro enclaves; verified assurance of how data is used and multiparty computation. Let's discuss each in a little bit more detail:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#verified-usage-of-data"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Verified Usage of Data
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've kind of alluded to this already, but suppose you have some sensitive data that you need to keep safe and you want to ensure that it is only used for pre-agreed purposes - then Nitro is your friend. You can keep your data encrypted at all times and only allow it to be decrypted within enclaves that are running a particular pre-approved program. This really helps to achieve internal standards towards GDPRs Data Minimization philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#multiparty-computation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Multiparty Computation
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of our big focuses at Oblivious. Multiparty computation is any computation that requires input from multiple parties which they are unwilling to share in plain text (ie they won't let the other parties see their data or software). There are typically three approaches to performing multiparty computation: find a trusted third party to facilitate the joint computation, apply a specific cryptographic handshake (typically the most robust but often very resource intensive) or use a secure enclave. In the context of Nitro enclaves, multiparty computation can be performed provided all parties have access to the Amazon KMS. Each party encrypts their data and sends it to the party who is hosting the enclave. A pre-agreed docker image is running in that party's EC2 and the enclave attests this when requesting the keys to decrypt the data within the enclave. This is a game-changer for secure SaaS, whereby you trust the security of AWS, but not necessarily the counterparty you are working with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#are-there-any-drawbacks-i-should-know-at-this-point"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Are there any drawbacks I should know at this point?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, more than a couple! Amazon Nitro is a great step forward for AWS users but there are a few things you should probably also know:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The security model is very much tied to that of Amazon's EC2s. This is pretty robust and has more certifications than you can count,  nevertheless, Nitro Enclaves are still a new technology and you should be aware that new technologies always bring some potential unforeseen risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enclaves generally, albeit Intel's chips through to Nitro enclaves, don't protect against many obvious side-channel attacks. For example, imagine we used it to make predictions to say if an image contained a picture of a cat or a dog. Hypothetically it took 1.2s to run whenever there was a dog in it and 1s whenever there was a cat, then the parent instance could simply log the run times and know exactly what was contained on encrypted images being sent in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memory is in RAM. To keep the enclave extra safe, all of the resources required by the docker container need to be stored in RAM and RAM is expensive. You can of course pass larger chunks of data in and out of the enclave as required, but encryption and decryption must be performed in each direction to keep that data safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No PCI device access. If you were hoping to start crunching lots of data on a NVIDIA GPU, you'll be a little frustrated as you cant use any compute other than the CPUs delegated to the enclave at build time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Debugging can be a real pain too. As we've been working a lot with Nitro we've developed some tools that make our life a lot easier, but at the very beginning of our journey with Nitro, the debugging was a right pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If security is your number one concern, there are a lot of ways to break the security of the code contained in the docker image is insecure in the first place. All the enclave guarantees is the container specified is what's running, not that it's in any way safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The enclaves only have that direct connection to Amazon's KMS, not Google's or Azure's for example. So if you are hoping to do multiparty computation you need all parties to be using the Amazon KMS to encrypt their data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#so-why-has-oblivious-been-tinkering-with-aws-nitro-enclaves"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  So why has Oblivious been tinkering with AWS Nitro Enclaves?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiparty computation (MPC) and privacy technologies are what we build at Oblivious. We started the company focussing on building very specific MPC cryptography protocols but as we began to engage with a larger number of customers we realized there was an ever more pressing challenge to balance security, privacy, and flexibility. Enclave technologies offer a different set of trade-offs to purely cryptographic protocols. Not better or worse, just different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found that while large organizations can afford to pay for bespoke crypto, 99% of businesses cannot. Enclaves offer a very flexible alternative approach for mainstream companies, especially those who already have the software they wish to secure as prototypes or which leverage other larger frameworks and libraries. Unfortunately, it is still not trivial to implement software on enclaves, manage access to the enclaves, and assign roles and users to code running within enclaves in the context of multiparty computation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's why we built &lt;em&gt;Ignite&lt;/em&gt;, an enclave management system (EMS) for AWS Nitro. This allows every AWS user to take advantage of Nitro enclaves for data analysis, machine learning, and differentially private data access control. Today, Ignite is available to early access users only, but if you are interested in becoming an early access member or getting a notification when it goes live for public use, drop us a line at &lt;em&gt;ignite(at)oblivious.ai&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JavaScript Promises</title>
      <author>Panchami Thulupule</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 10 Jul 2021 03:06:47 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-a-promise"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is a Promise?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Promise is an object in JavaScript used to handle asynchronous operations. They can handle multiple asynchronous operation and provide better error handling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Promise is always in one of the three states.&lt;br&gt;
pending - This is the initial state, we do not know if it is fulfilled or rejected.&lt;br&gt;
fulfilled - This indicated that the operation has completed successfully &lt;br&gt;
rejected - This indicates that the operation has failed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-promises-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why Promises ?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Promises help us deal with asynchronous code in a far more simpler way compared to callbacks.&lt;br&gt;
Callback hell can be avoided with Promises. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Callback hell is resulted when a lot of code is written and executed from top to bottom without any asynchronous functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-work-with-promises"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to work with promises
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-promises"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating Promises
&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const promise = new Promise()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-check-if-the-promise-is-in-pending-fulfilled-or-rejected-state"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to check if the promise is in pending, fulfilled or rejected state?
&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) =&amp;gt; {

})
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Promise constructor takes only one argument. That is a callback function.&lt;br&gt;
Callback function takes two arguments, resolve and reject&lt;br&gt;
resolve and reject functions are typically called after an async operation&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) =&amp;gt; {

    //when the promise got fulfilled
    resolve()
})
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;resolve is a function which is called when the state changes from pending to fulfilled.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) =&amp;gt; {
    //when the promise got rejected
    reject()
})
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;reject is a function which is called when the state changes from pending to rejected.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) =&amp;gt; {
  setTimeout(() =&amp;gt; {
    resolve()
  }, 1000)
)}

const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) =&amp;gt; {
  setTimeout(() =&amp;gt; {
    reject()
  }, 2000)
)}

promise.then()
promise.catch()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const onFulfillment = () =&amp;gt; {
  console.log("Promise is fulfilled")
}
const onRejected = () =&amp;gt; {
  console.log("Promise is not fulfilled")
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The onFulfillment and onRejected are used as callback functions in promise.&lt;br&gt;
Callback functions are functions that are passed in to another function as arguments&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Promise method gives us the access to two functions. They are then() and catch()&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We call these functions as&lt;br&gt;
promise.then()&lt;br&gt;
promise.catch()&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the promise status is changed from pending to fulfilled, then() is invoked.&lt;br&gt;
If the promise status is changed from pending to rejected, catch() is invoked.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;promise.then(onFulfillment)
promise.catch(onRejected) 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#promise-chaining"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Promise Chaining
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;fetch(url)
.then(process)
.then(output)
.catch(handleErrors)
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The process() function will wait for the fetch() to complete and the output() will wait untill the process() is completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the fecth(), process() and output() promises are rejected, handleErrors() is called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no guarantee of exactly when the operation will complete and the result will be returned, but there is a guarantee that when the result is available, or the promise fails, you can execute the code based on the result or handle the error if the promise is rejected.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to set up Tailwind CSS with Yew and Trunk</title>
      <author>arctic_hen7</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 10 Jul 2021 02:06:33 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/arctic_hen7/how-to-set-up-tailwind-css-with-yew-and-trunk-il9</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/arctic_hen7/how-to-set-up-tailwind-css-with-yew-and-trunk-il9</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/yewstack/yew"&gt;Yew&lt;/a&gt; is a fantastic tool for building web apps with Rust using WASM, though it has very little support for good CSS systems right now. This post will explain how to set up &lt;a href="https://tailwindcss.com"&gt;TailwindCSS&lt;/a&gt; with Yew and &lt;a href="https://github.com/thedodd/trunk"&gt;Trunk&lt;/a&gt; to create a fully-functional WASM set up with excellent CSS!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that this tutorial assumes you have a basic app already set up with Yew and Trunk. If not, check out Yew's official guide to building a starter app &lt;a href="https://yew.rs/getting-started/build-a-sample-app"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installing-things"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installing Things
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll use the &lt;a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#using-tailwind-cli"&gt;Tailwind CLI&lt;/a&gt; to set things up, which we'll install as a global &lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;yarn&lt;/code&gt; dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are religiously against installing such JavaScript evils on your sacred system, try &lt;a href="https://github.com/matiu2/tailwind-yew-builder"&gt;tailwind-yew-builder&lt;/a&gt;, it does very similar things in Docker so you don't have to pollute your computer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can install the Tailwind CLI like so:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm i -g tailwindcss
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;or&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn global add tailwindcss
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now run a sanity check:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;tailwindcss --help
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You should see the help page for the Tailwind CLI! If not, make sure you've set up your &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt; properly for global installs by either NPM or Yarn (particularly Yarn...).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setting-up-tailwind"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setting up Tailwind
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we're aiming to get is a single CSS file that we can include in our Trunk HTML. We can do this by running this in the same directory as our top-level &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; for Trunk:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;tailwindcss -o ./tailwind.css
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That will generate a file named &lt;code&gt;tailwind.css&lt;/code&gt; that contains around 4MB of pure CSS. We'll come back to cutting that down. For now though, you should make sure that doesn't get added to version control by adding it your &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt; like so:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;tailwind.css
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now it's time to include that file in our &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;, which we can do by adding this to the head:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;data-trunk&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"./tailwind.css"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;rel=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"css"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This directs Trunk to use the Tailwind file as a stylesheet. You can now use styles in your Yew &lt;code&gt;html!&lt;/code&gt;, try it out like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight rust"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;html!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;classes!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"bg-red-100"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Test!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now is you run &lt;code&gt;trunk serve&lt;/code&gt;, you should see a paragraph saying &lt;em&gt;Test&lt;/em&gt; with a very light red background! Congratulations, you've set up Tailwind with Yew in development!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#going-to-production"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Going to production
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all well and good, but we do NOT want to be serving 4MB of assets to our users! Tailwind has an inbuilt feature for purging unused CSS classes, which it does by searching for the classes you've used. It does that using a regular expression, which just analyses the file, meaning Rust is fine!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;code&gt;tailwind.config.js&lt;/code&gt; file at the root of your project and add this to it:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;purge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./src/**/*.rs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./index.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./src/**/*.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./src/**/*.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;variants&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;plugins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can add any other Tailwind configuration you might have in here as well. All this does though is instruct Tailwind to look at all Rust, HTML, and CSS files in &lt;code&gt;src/&lt;/code&gt; and remove any classes it doesn't find being used there. We also check &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; in case you have anything in there. This check could probably be refined using the &lt;code&gt;extract&lt;/code&gt; property so it only checks Rust files in &lt;code&gt;html!&lt;/code&gt;, but this is good enough for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now try building Tailwind for production by running this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;NODE_ENV=production tailwindcss -c ./tailwind.config.js -o ./tailwind.css --minify
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That will automatically enable purging, and now check the size of the &lt;code&gt;tailwind.css&lt;/code&gt; file. It should be something like 3KB! That's a pretty giant improvement!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#bonus-command-aliases"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Bonus: command aliases
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These commands are pretty long and tedious to execute regularly, so you might want to use something like &lt;a href="https://github.com/arctic-hen7/bonnie"&gt;Bonnie&lt;/a&gt; to alias them to shorter commands like &lt;code&gt;build&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;run&lt;/code&gt;. Check out &lt;a href="https://github.com/arctic-hen7/bonnie/wiki"&gt;the Bonnie wiki&lt;/a&gt; for an explanation of how this example file works (should be pretty self-explanatory though):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight toml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="py"&gt;version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"0.3.1"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nn"&gt;[scripts]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;## Builds Tailwind CSS for development (no purging)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="py"&gt;build-tailwind-dev&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;"cd frontend"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;"tailwindcss -c ./tailwind.config.js -o ./tailwind.css"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;## Builds Tailwind CSS for production (maximum purging and minification)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="py"&gt;build-tailwind-prod&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;"cd frontend"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;"NODE_ENV=production tailwindcss -c ./tailwind.config.js -o ./tailwind.css --minify"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;## Builds Tailwind CSS for development usage&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="py"&gt;setup.subcommands.tailwind&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"bonnie build-tailwind-dev"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="py"&gt;setup.subcommands.prompt-tailwind&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"echo &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;Have you installed the Tailwind CLI globally with 'npm i -g tailwindcss' or 'yarn global add tailwindcss'?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="py"&gt;setup.order&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"""
tailwind {
    Failure =&amp;gt; prompt-tailwind
}
"""&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;## Builds everything&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="py"&gt;build.cmd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"cargo build"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;## Builds the frontend&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="py"&gt;build.subcommands.frontend&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;"cd frontend"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;"bonnie build-tailwind-prod"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;"cargo build"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;## Runs the frontend, watching for changes (uses Trunk)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;## Tailwind is assumed to be set up after `setup`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="py"&gt;run.subcommands.frontend&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;"cd frontend"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;"trunk serve"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then anyone starting out with your project can just run &lt;code&gt;bonnie setup&lt;/code&gt; to build Tailwind for them! Running &lt;code&gt;bonnie run frontend&lt;/code&gt; will spin up a Trunk server for you automatically, and &lt;code&gt;bonnie build frontend&lt;/code&gt; will build everything for production (including Tailwind)! Note that this configuration assumes you've got everything in &lt;code&gt;frontend/&lt;/code&gt; in case you've got a &lt;code&gt;backend/&lt;/code&gt; as well (if not you can just remove those bits).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Full disclosure: I am the maintainer of &lt;a href="https://github.com/arctic-hen7/bonnie"&gt;Bonnie&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#closing-words"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Closing words
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, you now have a working setup with TailwindCSS and Yew! As always, any feedback would be greatly appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy coding!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Turn your Create React App into a Progressive Web App in 100 seconds</title>
      <author>Michael Fatemi</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 10 Jul 2021 00:25:21 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/myfatemi04/turn-your-create-react-app-into-a-progressive-web-app-in-100-seconds-3c11</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/myfatemi04/turn-your-create-react-app-into-a-progressive-web-app-in-100-seconds-3c11</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/"&gt;Progressive Web Apps&lt;/a&gt; (PWAs) let regular apps become accessible offline. They also have access to more features than regular apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React Apps need two features to become Progressive Web Apps.&lt;br&gt;
First, they need a service worker, which does work in the background of the app. Second, they need a &lt;code&gt;manifest.json&lt;/code&gt; file in the public folder, which includes the name of the app, the home page, and icons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're starting fresh, you can use the Create React App template &lt;code&gt;cra-template-pwa&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;cra-template-pwa-typescript&lt;/code&gt;) to bootstrap this process. If you want to create a React app from the start like this, use the command &lt;code&gt;npx create-react-app app-name --template cra-template-pwa&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;npx create-react-app app-name --template cra-template-pwa-typescript&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, if you're like me, you didn't think to add this template in the beginning, and are wondering how to add it to an existing app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-raw-manifestjson-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. &lt;code&gt;manifest.json&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;manifest.json&lt;/code&gt; goes in the &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most parts are self-explanatory. You can generate this file with websites like &lt;a href="https://www.simicart.com/manifest-generator.html/"&gt;Simicart's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's an example. Note that this requires &lt;code&gt;favicon.ico&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;logo192.png&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;logo512.png&lt;/code&gt; to be available in the &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"short_name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"App"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"My App"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"icons"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"src"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"favicon.ico"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"sizes"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"64x64 32x32 24x24 16x16"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"type"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"image/x-icon"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"src"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"logo192.png"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"type"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"image/png"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"sizes"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"192x192"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"src"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"logo512.png"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"type"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"image/png"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"sizes"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"512x512"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"start_url"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"display"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"standalone"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"theme_color"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"#000000"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"background_color"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"#ffffff"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;


&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-raw-serviceworkerjs-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. &lt;code&gt;service-worker.js&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a baseline, go to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/cra-template/pwa/tree/master/packages/cra-template-pwa-typescript/template/src"&gt;cra-template-pwa github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copy &lt;code&gt;service-worker.ts&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;serviceWorkerRegistration.ts&lt;/code&gt; into the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, at the top of your &lt;code&gt;index.tsx&lt;/code&gt; (or any entrypoint), import the service worker registration like so:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;serviceWorkerRegistration&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;./serviceWorkerRegistration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the bottom of your &lt;code&gt;index.tsx&lt;/code&gt;, add the following code to opt into an "offline-first" app:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;serviceWorkerRegistration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;register&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Should you be hiring a software developer or a senior software developer…and what’s the difference? And how can you know during an interview? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help answer these questions, Tomasz Waraksa, a tenured senior software developer with decades of hiring experience, joins the &lt;a href="https://devinterrupted.com/podcast/uncover-the-real-senior-developer/"&gt;Dev Interrupted podcast&lt;/a&gt; to explain how companies should rethink their approach to hiring a senior software developer, and what it means when one joins your team.&lt;/p&gt;
