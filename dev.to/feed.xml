      <description>&lt;p&gt;AI, or artificial intelligence, is an often overused buzzword that in itself highlights how far technology has come, especially as it relates to design in startups. While artificial intelligence has traditionally been used in personalizing products and services based on large repositories of collected data, it has become used by some of the most innovative startups to help assist and drive the entire design decision-making process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Statista &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/607716/worldwide-artificial-intelligence-market-revenues/"&gt;Statista&lt;/a&gt;, the value of the AI market is set to grow by $126 billion by 2025. Therefore, there is significant room for development in the industry as it relates to product design and creativity for companies. The question lies in how can AI promote control over creative concepts and design in companies, especially startups, in a way that such contributions are meaningful and result in more efficiency for product teams? From a design context, AI will allow startups to realize empathy as a component when designing products and then use those insights, oftentimes gained from valuable data, to drive the development of extremely personalized products. Moreover, one of the central ways AI is practical for startups is to enhance design decisions. Design decision-making used to be a slow process that required many resources from companies, and even worse for startups, presenting bottlenecks in product development. AI now allows startups to make more efficient and speedy design decisions, which ultimately result in better products and most importantly, satisfied users. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#enhancing-design-decisions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Enhancing design decisions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design decision-making was previously time-consuming and relied on the traditional &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking"&gt;design thinking&lt;/a&gt; principles from ideation to prototyping. The process was very routine, and included many repetitive steps, not to mention the back and forth as a result of sometimes inefficient user testing. AI enhances the design decision-making process by reassigning the role of the designer to one that has more capabilities and control over design outcomes, largely due to insights and the use of tools that eliminate repetitive tasks and time-consuming research. With such insights and efficiency, designers can create experiences that precisely match the users that products are intended for.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-ai-assists-in-the-design-of-better-products"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How AI assists in the design of better products
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User researchers often gather data from controlled environments, and while often extremely useful, for companies that want to tailor their research and find out how to personalize products and services for the many different users of their products, it could be very resource-intensive. AI gathers data such as location, product selection, reviews, and more to create distinctive profiles that are later used to provide design teams with what features to incorporate in future product designs. The gathered data that AI repositories have accumulated over time enables designers to keep products human-centric, in other words, user-friendly by acknowledging the problem-solving model and leveraging the benefits of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning"&gt;machine learning&lt;/a&gt; and extreme personalization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ai-for-humancentered-design"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AI for human-centered design
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-centered_design"&gt;Human-centered design&lt;/a&gt; is rooted in user experience and draws on insights gained from empathy. While there’s still much to be learned in terms of AI’s ability to assist empathetic design that puts users first, designers could iteratively improve products based on a user's interaction with certain components of design. For example, if a certain shape, size, or color of a product’s UI elements improves user experience based on geographical location, then AI could help designers design other products for those locations given previously gathered information. This iterative process of improving a product is imperative to satisfying end-user outcomes and is based on the problem-solving loop, a process that’s common among innovative startups. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#design-problem-solving"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Design problem solving
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problem-solving in design is a complex of activities that involve different techniques during the solution creation process. While creativity has a lot to do with imagination, problem-solving is an integral component. If startups could adhere to principles of the problem-solving process, and develop human-centric products, while using insights from gathered datasets to improve products, then their user-friendly designs would put them ahead of the industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem-solving process: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Define the problem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Create the solution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Test and learn.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Refine the solution based on testing results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By following the problem-solving process, designers can leverage AI to make high-level design decisions and then create products based on the insights. These unique benefits are exemplified by machine learning and its capabilities of personalization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#learning-and-personalization"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Learning and personalization
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A system's ability to learn and teach itself is based on preset parameters set by humans, an aspect of AI that designers could take advantage of. By designing products based on the many different datasets gained from user interactions, products could be customized even in real-time. For instance, Amazon makes product suggestions based on user’s browsing and search history, so the system can adapt to user preferences continuously. This process iteratively improves the product and provides a precise level of personalization that’s unprecedented.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#final-thoughts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Final thoughts
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence is a valuable tool that could help drive creativity for startups. The capabilities that AI presents allow startups to easily use data gathered from insights to create user-centered products emphatically. The problem-solving process allows startups to leverage the principles of gathering user data to enable AI’s iterative improvement capabilities. With problem-solving models, high-level design decisions would result in a fast and efficient design process, leaving more repetitive design aspects to technology. The information gathered from users over time could also help design teams cater to users based on a set of parameters. With an interactive approach to making design decisions based on insights from AI, startups could realize its immense potential to create better products. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Crap, we might have installed a malicious dependency...</title>
      <author>Daniel Parmenvik</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 10:24:01 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/danielp/crap-we-might-have-installed-a-malicious-dependency-1p91</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/danielp/crap-we-might-have-installed-a-malicious-dependency-1p91</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;That was the reality for a lot of companies after the ua-parser-js supply chain attack. On October 22 three malicious versions of the popular package &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ua-parser-js&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; were released. A package which has almost 8M weekly downloads. If your company has used compromised versions of this package directly or indirectly, consider your system as &lt;strong&gt;fully compromised&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you might think how the heck is this even possible? After all, &lt;em&gt;“it’s just JavaScript”&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The maintainer account for ua-parser-js was taken over, meaning attackers had control and deployed malware versions. These versions in turn were downloaded by many users around the world. Silently the malicious versions installed a trojan and a crypto mining application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The impact is critical&lt;/strong&gt; with the file system made public, screenshots taken as well as downloading and execution of unknown binaries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-result"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;The result&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of companies are still vigorously trying to figure out if they were exposed.  Often by spending resources and money on manually making sure no one inside their organization used the affected malicious versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fully understand the need for companies to be sure they’re not affected - but this problem also indicates that companies lack proper control over external dependencies. An investment into proper protection is something that would save money in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tldr"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malicious and packages with vulnerabilities. You need to protect you team, environments and organization without depending on specific individuals when it comes to dependency security. &lt;a href="https://bytesafe.dev/posts/cybersecurity-adding-security-to-products-processes/"&gt;Here's a free downloadable checklist (PDF) &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-could-this-happen"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How could this happen?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The component ua-parser-js is used to detect browser user data and is used indirectly by many others. For example the popular web ui framework angular.js has a dependency to test framework karma which in turn has a dependency to ua-parser-js. This is commonplace in JavaScript where applications on average depend on up to 700 other components - and most of these are indirect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you know, to be able to use a JavaScript app, you need to install its dependencies first. Something which is very easy, but where things can go really wrong. If the packages you’re installing, or any of the indirect dependencies, contain vulnerabilities, then you &lt;strong&gt;might be out of luck&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s crucial to secure your whole software supply chain&lt;/strong&gt;, including software build environments (CI/CD), test, development and similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem lies in that a lot of environments are not restricted in what packages can be downloaded and installed. And with as little as 10% of all maintainers using two-factor authentication, the companies need to take dependency security as a serious threat and act accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#so-whats-the-solution"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  So, what's the solution?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite a few people have contacted us asking how this could have been prevented and how to stay secure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. You need automated tooling where you are able to secure your existing workflows.&lt;/strong&gt; This way developers and systems are secured by default. Unfortunately, many companies fail in this regard which is a major gamble. It works until it no longer does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Companies need to enforce dependency policies and make sure they have the right tools to be able to control what packages are allowed in the organization.&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure neither automated systems nor developers install the latest versions of packages without first taking a conscious decision. Avoiding outdated and vulnerable components is of course not an option either!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Companies need tooling to keep track of what components are used and where.&lt;/strong&gt; Manually reviewing every piece of software or line of code is neither efficient nor possible in many cases when an incident occurs. Be proactive and secure your supply chain before it’s an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#download-a-checklist-on-dependency-security"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Download a checklist on dependency security
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are in the final sprint of the &lt;strong&gt;Cybersecurity Awareness Month&lt;/strong&gt; - so why not spread some awareness 😊.  Here's a one page cheat sheet on what measures you can take to protect your organization, &lt;a href="https://bytesafe.dev/posts/cybersecurity-adding-security-to-products-processes/"&gt;link to blog post with a free downloadable PDF&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What is Structured Data?</title>
      <author>James Turner</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 10:03:47 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/brandvantage/what-is-structured-data-86n</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/brandvantage/what-is-structured-data-86n</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Structured data is data that is structured - that is perhaps the most succinct summary of it without telling you anything you didn't already expect. To take away something more than that, it can be useful to break down what structured data can look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we say a set of data is structured, it has properties and values that hold a specific meaning. One value might represent some amount of money, another value might represent a date, and a third might be an address. When labelled appropriately, these values can then represent a greater context - perhaps they represent details on an invoice or payslip.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"amount"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;20.00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"datePaid"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"2017-08-12T12:56:00"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"address"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"123 Example Street, Some Suburb, Some City"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This data could be in a database, a spreadsheet, a JSON blob - it doesn't matter. If there is data and a defined &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model"&gt;data model&lt;/a&gt;, that is structured data. When data is structured well, it makes it easier to query, process and generally use the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, there is also unstructured data. The value for our address property in the example above is itself unstructured data.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;123 Example Street, Some Suburb, Some City
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That single value has multiple internal components we would need to parse out depending what we are wanting to do. If we wanted to group all the records on the same street, we'd need to carefully parse the street, suburb and city out of our data. Different countries can have different formats and rules for addresses it is hard to process. Making the wrong assumption when parsing the data can lead to irregularities in the data, causing problems for whatever we wanted to consume that data. For instance, depending where you are in the world, can you assume &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSG-zxGRkJw"&gt;all streets even have names&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While structured data can definitely be easier to work with, it doesn't make unstructured data useless. Instead, think of unstructured data as untapped potential - useful data exists but is difficult to get to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#structured-data-and-web-pages"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Structured Data and Web Pages
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web pages are an interesting example of both structured and unstructured data. There are specific elements one could look at for certain information like the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element or other semantic elements like &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;article&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;section&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. The problem though is that these elements are more like our "address" example earlier - they often contain more than just the strict data we are looking for. A title might have a prefix or suffix of the website's name. An article or section might have many other layers of &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or any other elements to help form the site's structure. To top it off, the HTML structure can vary wildly from site to site. If you were wanting to extract data from multiple websites, it can get very hard very fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, there are a number of ways to embed structured data into web pages. A web page could use &lt;a href="https://brandvantage.co/blog/what-is-microdata"&gt;Microdata&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa"&gt;RDFa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://json-ld.org/"&gt;JSON-LD&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://ogp.me/"&gt;Open Graph&lt;/a&gt; to express structured data. More than that though, a web page can use multiple of these at the same time. Open Graph is commonly used as a method of defining details for a link preview while the others might express more complex data like product pricing or reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having standard formats like Microdata or JSON-LD are a good start but only represent the format of the data - we need a common vocabulary so we can understand the data those formats encode. One common vocabulary used is called &lt;a href="https://schema.org"&gt;Schema.org&lt;/a&gt; and provides over 700 types including types to describe people, places, products, recipes, reviews, vehicles, movies and medical devices. Using Schema.org for structured data on a website can &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/structured-data/intro-structured-data"&gt;help search engines provide richer experiences in the search results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#summary"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Structured data, through standardising expected properties and value formats, makes the sharing and processing of data easier. Web pages in particular benefit from encoding structured data in their mark-up where it can be used by search engines and &lt;a href="https://brandvantage.co/services/web-page-api"&gt;other tools&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CSS + frontend Resources you must take a look at</title>
      <author>Posandu </author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 09:41:37 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/posandu/css-frontend-resources-you-must-take-a-look-at-14ph</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/posandu/css-frontend-resources-you-must-take-a-look-at-14ph</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post was first published on &lt;a href="https://www.tronic247.com/css-frontend-resources-you-must-take-a-look-at/"&gt;Tronic247&lt;/a&gt;. If you can read it there, I would be really happy :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, I will tell you some resources you should bookmark as a CSS or Frontend developer. So, let's start!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#css-gradient"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  CSS Gradient
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a site where there is a GUI where you can create gradients and get the CSS code for that. You can see a preview down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--thpBYa81--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76736580/139233635-6c32b411-a36c-4163-b20f-764dd88f0af4.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--thpBYa81--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76736580/139233635-6c32b411-a36c-4163-b20f-764dd88f0af4.png" alt="" width="880" height="607"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the link for that site - &lt;a href="https://cssgradient.io/"&gt;https://cssgradient.io/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#clippy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Clippy
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tool is useful for making &lt;code&gt;clip paths&lt;/code&gt; fast. You can see the tool by clicking this link &lt;a href="https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/"&gt;https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--B74ID3mD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76736580/139234329-6b94d563-965d-480c-a9cd-73a8dc7456cc.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--B74ID3mD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76736580/139234329-6b94d563-965d-480c-a9cd-73a8dc7456cc.png" alt="" width="880" height="681"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#neumorphismio"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Neumorphism.io
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this tool, you can make 3D and realistic box shadows. without sweating. &lt;a href="https://neumorphism.io/"&gt;https://neumorphism.io/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>20 Python One-Liners That Will Help You Code Like a Pro</title>
      <author>Jonny</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/jnc/powerful-python-one-liners-to-look-like-a-pro-4m45</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Python is an amazing and versatile programming language that is very easy to learn and work with. Like many programming languages, it offers more than one way to solve a problem, some requiring more lines of code than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, fewer lines of code is not always the best answer, as sometimes we may clutter our algorithms and make them hard to read and understand, but when done right, it increases the quality of your code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python as a programming language is extremely good at this, reason why it is so often the favorite choice for coding challenges, interviews, and the likes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we will learn a few snippets and tricks you can use to solve everyday operations into a single line of code, going from the very simple to some more advanced techniques. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Own Your Retro Nintendo Games Collection on GitHub Page </title>
      <author>Anshuman Abhishek</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 09:11:42 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/_anshuman/own-your-retro-nintendo-games-collection-on-github-page-15l1</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a video game lover then there is a high chance that you like Nintendo NES and SNES games. They are just classic. Looking back at the 80's 90's games always brings back a sense of nostalgia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/PTFRmGOgiPUS4/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/PTFRmGOgiPUS4/giphy.gif" width="400" height="224"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#we-know-that-nes-and-snes-games-are-flooded-all-over-the-internet-you-can-play-these-games-online-on-web-browsers-or-offline-using-emulators-or-mobile-apps-but-they-are-not-much-handy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  We know that NES and SNES games are flooded all over the internet. You can play these games online on web browsers or offline using emulators or mobile apps. But they are not much handy.
&lt;/h4&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/PUTI8BNmOewD0A1lqY/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/PUTI8BNmOewD0A1lqY/giphy.gif" width="480" height="274"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-they-are-not-handy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why they are not handy:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On websites, there are thousands of games and has a search engine that makes you confuse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don't have your own favorite games collection or Dashboard where you can simply choose. Most people think that there is only one game that is Mario but it's not true.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have to make extra effort to reach there if you play online&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you use NES/SNES emulators then handle/management cost very high and restrict to one device to play&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the case of mobile phone, nowadays no one like extra application for each task on their smartphones. It is better to be a website where can play games.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#solution"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Solution:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create your own platform like I create one without paying a penny
&lt;a href="https://anshuman2121.github.io/nintendo/#"&gt;https://anshuman2121.github.io/nintendo/#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make your own collection of games that you like(this is a one-time investment)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a free permanent GH Page and play anytime anywhere on any device
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#after-a-lot-of-research-i-arguably-find-the-best-emulator-on-the-internet-no-ads-and-selfhosted-a-javascript-emulator-for-nes-snes-and-more"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  After a lot of research, I arguably find The BEST emulator on the internet. No ads and self-hosted! A JavaScript emulator for NES, SNES, and more!
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#advantages"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Advantages:
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work on almost any platform like on Laptop, mobile devices, or on TABs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can play using a keyboard, touchscreen, or even connect your fav gaming controller and play.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can play multiplayer as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To be frank NES and SNES games are not easy games and can frustrate you. You definitely need a save feature that is present in modern gaming platforms like PlayStation. So, it is also has a feature to save a game state from where you can start again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/9KF0pyrLyXpnHhDGsc/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/9KF0pyrLyXpnHhDGsc/giphy.gif" width="480" height="344"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lets-discuss-what-changes-i-made"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Let's discuss what changes I made:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have simply created a repo on GITHUB and named it Nintendo.
&lt;a href="https://github.com/Anshuman2121/nintendo"&gt;github.com/Anshuman2121/nintendo&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy the JavaScript emulators and just keep 'NES and SNES' data/emulators and remove others just to make it light. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download all my favorite games from &lt;a href="https://wowroms.com/"&gt;wowroms.com&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.emulatorgames.net/"&gt;emulatorgames.net&lt;/a&gt;. If you still have not decided which games you need to download then visit &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/lists/top-100-nes-games"&gt;ign.com/lists/top-100-nes-games&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/lists/top-100-snes-games"&gt;ign.com/lists/top-100-snes-games&lt;/a&gt;. IGN is just like an IMDB for movies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now place those games in the repo. I place those in folder nes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next task is to make your web page beautiful. For this I choose &lt;a href="https://getbootstrap.com/"&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;. This is arguably one of the best CSS framework which make your webpage responsive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subsequently create a function that can call NES/SNES emulator. If you know the basics of Javascript it won't take much effort to understand this
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;var gameUrl
    function myfunction(id1)
    {
        var gameUrl = id1
        var extension = id1.split('.').pop()
        if (['fds', 'nes', 'unif', 'unf'].includes(extension)) {
            var core = 'nes';
        } else if (['smc', 'fig', 'sfc', 'gd3', 'gd7', 'dx2', 'bsx', 'swc'].includes(extension)) {
            var core = 'snes';
        } else {
            var core = prompt('Input core (examples: nes, snes, n64, gb, gba, psx)');
        };
        document.body.innerHTML = ''
        var a = document.createElement('div');
        a.style = "width:800px;height:600px;max-width:100%;margin: auto;";
        var b = document.createElement('div');
        b.id = 'game';
        a.appendChild(b);
        document.body.appendChild(a);

        var script = document.createElement('script');
        script.innerHTML = "EJS_player = '#game'; EJS_biosUrl = ''; EJS_gameUrl = '" + gameUrl + "'; EJS_core = '" + core + "'; EJS_pathtodata = 'data/'; ";
        document.body.appendChild(script);
        var script = document.createElement('script');
        script.src = 'data/loader.js';
        document.body.appendChild(script);
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Afterwards, I need to create hyperlinks of every game which I have in folder nes which capable to call function myfunction
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a href='#' class="btn btn-warning" onclick="myfunction('nes/Lion King, The (U).smc')"&amp;gt; Lion King SNES&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have around 100 games in repo and if simply do one by one it took a lot of time. So, I just took help from VSCode use the shortcut "shift + alt" and command line "ls -l &amp;gt; names"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eventually, you need to create a GHpage for this you can follow this
&lt;a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site"&gt;getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-you-need-to-do-to-make-your-own-copy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What you need to do to make your own copy:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just make a clone of the repo
&lt;a href="https://github.com/Anshuman2121/nintendo"&gt;https://github.com/Anshuman2121/nintendo&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download games and put it in nes folder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make changes in index.html&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create your own personal free GitHub Page. 
&lt;a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site"&gt;Creating a GitHub pages site&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;







&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#congratulations-now-you-have-your-own-website-where-you-have-your-own-games-collection-which-you-can-play-anywhere-anytime-and-on-any-device"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Congratulations! Now you have your own website where you have your own games collection which you can play anywhere anytime and on any device!
&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;a href="#setting-up-a-data-engineering-environment"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setting up a data engineering environment
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When diving into the data engineering world, it is important for the set up  to be ready.&lt;br&gt;
To set up a data engineering environment it is advisable to work on Linux Environment. &lt;br&gt;
To start with we started by using linux as a host machine.&lt;br&gt;
Then we installed Virtual machine VMware. Then on the Vmware we installed the downloaded Windows operating system.&lt;br&gt;
Now in order to make communication between host(Ubuntu) and virtual machine(Windows) we need to make configurations and networking on Vmware.You need to enable VNC connections as shown below.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ogyL_qxj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/712chbscpxnlixrd3q29.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ogyL_qxj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/712chbscpxnlixrd3q29.png" alt="Image description" width="624" height="351"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installation-of-mssql-server"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installation of MSSQL Server.
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this guide we walk you through the MSSQL Server installation in Windows on VMware.&lt;br&gt;
The first step is to download SQL SERVER 2012. In this case it's the one we are using currently.&lt;br&gt;
You can download it from here or download a later version. Then follow the instructions to install it,&lt;br&gt;
then launch the SSMS(Sql Server Management Studio).The UI should be something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qA3_TkBs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lnyldbfyln1iyrc7afra.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qA3_TkBs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lnyldbfyln1iyrc7afra.png" alt="Image description" width="624" height="320"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installation-of-postgres-database-on-ubuntu-2004"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installation of Postgres Database on Ubuntu 20.04.
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will now install Postgres in our Ubuntu. To install this follow the installation steps here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#for-postgres-configuration-steps"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  For Postgres configuration steps:
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To check for Postgres version &lt;br&gt;
       psql --version&lt;br&gt;
It is advisable to check if the Postgres is running using this command before you proceed&lt;br&gt;
       sudo systemctl status postgresql&lt;br&gt;
Connection To PostgreSQL running.&lt;br&gt;
       sudo -u postgres psql&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installation-of-adventureworks2019-and-adventureworksdw2019"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installation of AdventureWorks2019 and AdventureWorksDW2019
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First to start using the databases we start with installing Adventureworks2019 and DW.&lt;br&gt;
To install follow the steps found here. Once installed we need to configure them in MSSQL Server on a virtual machine using these steps here.&lt;br&gt;
After installation and configuration open SSMS and this should be the UI in SSMS:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ozHlSZrT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vcj49ey6fslai31wdy19.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ozHlSZrT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vcj49ey6fslai31wdy19.png" alt="Image description" width="624" height="341"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-introduction-totalend-openstudio"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3.  Introduction toTalend OpenStudio
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to start with low code ETL tools. In this article I will show how to install and get started with Talend. We will use Talend later to Migrate Data from MSSQL Server to Postgres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get started we download Talend open Studio for linux here.After downloading you will receive multiple files,run the linux file which has a .sh file and launch talend. This is how it should open:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GwyeOYEe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sxvmx9dy2jh1n81m9uk4.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GwyeOYEe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sxvmx9dy2jh1n81m9uk4.png" alt="Image description" width="624" height="351"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#migrating-data-from-sql-server-to-postgres-using-talend-etl"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Migrating Data from SQL Server to Postgres Using Talend ETL
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the Talend Studio we create a job then create tBDInput for SQL Server and tBDOutput for Postgres. At this point, you can create a connection between the two databases. &lt;br&gt;
Right Click on tBDInput Trigger the On subjob OK and drag it to tBDOutput to make the connection complete. &lt;br&gt;
Ensure to enter correctly the database credentials i.e username, password and database name ,table name ,which hosts the table or database to migrate. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MgadTfkw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ha5hg7t396ezng4z1fmt.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MgadTfkw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ha5hg7t396ezng4z1fmt.png" alt="Image description" width="624" height="351"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eID5Wrzx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n9ez8t8vmf6xs3lmlutp.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eID5Wrzx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n9ez8t8vmf6xs3lmlutp.png" alt="Image description" width="624" height="351"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all the configuring and connecting both databases it's time now to start moving our data from Sql server to postgres. We write an Sql query to migrate the data.To start with we start with SQL server by using the following command which gets data from users table:&lt;br&gt;
“select userid, user_name, user_email,convert(varchar, getdate(), 0)run_date_time from users"&lt;br&gt;
This is used for migration and logging using the get_date function.&lt;br&gt;
Now we now have to write an SQL query to insert data into postgres.In the UI we create a table and drop it if it exists then perform the action of insertion to custdatademo table as shown;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wA33e6rY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zplkuqqjulixmg9vxjsm.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wA33e6rY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zplkuqqjulixmg9vxjsm.png" alt="Image description" width="624" height="351"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4EoUiDjo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8x8ptj0sjq3fcrl9260u.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4EoUiDjo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8x8ptj0sjq3fcrl9260u.png" alt="Image description" width="624" height="351"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Zb6fX3zD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mpxx6qqaamaiz0b13qig.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Zb6fX3zD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mpxx6qqaamaiz0b13qig.png" alt="Image description" width="624" height="337"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Now it's time where we have been waiting for so long  and it's time to see our output in Postgres. Let's dive in fast  and confirm our hard work.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uJ2STrQT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jylnwl1xyz160mlirtlm.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uJ2STrQT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jylnwl1xyz160mlirtlm.png" alt="Image description" width="624" height="351"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see we have migrated the data successfully. Thank you for being with us in this long journey.&lt;br&gt;
This is a  complete Extract, Transform and Load(ETL) using Talend.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Artificial Intelligence has made a significant impact on our daily lives. Every time you scroll through social media, open Spotify, or do a quick Google search, you are using an application of AI. The AI industry has expanded massively in the past few years and is predicted to grow even further, reaching around 126 billion U.S. dollars by 2025. Multinational companies like IBM, Accenture, and Apple are actively hiring AI practitioners. The median salary of an AI engineer as of 2021 is $171, 715 that can go over $250,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field of AI is vast, and there are many areas within the industry that you can choose to specialise. Say , if you are intrigued by facial recognition systems and image generation, you can choose to work in the field of computer vision. If you’d like to build models that can converse with people and learn human language, you can work in the field of NLP (Natural Language Processing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of work being done today for the advancement of Artificial Intelligence. Companies need AI specialists who can build and deploy scalable models to meet growing industry demands. It isn’t tough to get started in the field of AI. While there is the complexity involved in building machine learning models from scratch, most AI jobs in the industry today don’t require you to know the math behind these models. Many companies require individuals who can build AI solutions, scale them, and deploy them for the end-user. Many high-level libraries and frameworks can help you do this without an in-depth knowledge of how the models work. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Top Reasons Why Businesses choose Salesforce Outsourcing Services 
</title>
      <author>BinalPrajapati123</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 08:48:35 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/binalprajapati123/top-reasons-why-businesses-choose-salesforce-outsourcing-services-p7h</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/binalprajapati123/top-reasons-why-businesses-choose-salesforce-outsourcing-services-p7h</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This blog will show why all businesses nowadays need to &lt;em&gt;outsource salesforce services&lt;/em&gt; for their projects to minimize Business risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All businesses now choose salesforce to boost their business in the right direction with more efficiency. Yes, adopting and implementing salesforce in your business gives you lots of benefits. Still, apart from it, by outsourcing salesforce services, you can get faster services with efficiency, maintaining professionalism without investing a huge amount. Yes, it is now common to outsource salesforce development services to reduce high-quality costs through experts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-do-businesses-choose-to-transfer-to-outsource-salesforce-services"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why do Businesses choose to transfer to outsource salesforce services?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-reduce-operating-cost"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  (1) Reduce Operating Cost
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hiring In-house certified developers is a costly process and when it comes to picking and hiring the right best-experienced developer is not easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-reduce-burden"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  (2) Reduce Burden
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By outsourcing salesforce services, they have defined duties, roles, and responsibilities towards your organization. So the burden is removed by sharing the responsibilities and duties. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-save-money-and-time"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  (3) Save Money and Time
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, outsourcing salesforce services and certified salesforce experts save you time and money compared to in-house teams. By outsourcing, the salesforce experts solve every issue daily so you can get more work implementation in less time at a lower cost. The central benefit is you don't have to pay training expenses in an organization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-247-availability-and-support"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  (4) 24/7 Availability and support
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;24/7 availability and support in the in-house organization are not possible. In that situation, the outsourcing salesforce services provider can give you a non-stop 24/7 availability support and accessibility for you as per the needs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-find-and-utilize-the-right-resources-with-efficiency"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  (5) Find and Utilize the Right Resources with efficiency
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding the right and experienced developers locally for in-house is quite difficult. But when choosing the right and best company by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;outsourcing salesforce services&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, you can get the highly experienced and best resources for your salesforce project with high productivity and efficiency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#points-to-consider-while-choosing-outsourcing-salesforce-services"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Points to Consider while choosing outsourcing Salesforce services
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experience&lt;br&gt;
Skill Set&lt;br&gt;
Accessibility&lt;br&gt;
Communication&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salesforce is the major part of your organization to maximize your sales and make your business to the next level. An in-house team may not be sufficient to implement all your needs and requirements in your project. Still, by outsourcing salesforce services from the top &lt;a href="https://www.bacancytechnology.com/salesforce-development-services"&gt;salesforce development company&lt;/a&gt;, you can get reliable, productive, high-quality resources and services from them. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>OSD600 - Lab 6 - Docusaurus</title>
      <author>Thanh Van</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 08:31:30 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/tcvan0707/osd600-lab-6-docusaurus-2nae</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/tcvan0707/osd600-lab-6-docusaurus-2nae</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#learning-docusaurus"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Learning Docusaurus
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Docusaurus is basically a &lt;strong&gt;React-based&lt;/strong&gt; static site generator, which is built and maintained by &lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;. If we are maintaining an open source project website, Docusaurus is definitely a good friend for us since it is easily built, deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#set-up-a-docusaurus-project"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Set up a Docusaurus project
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lNCSfDyB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u6iczrfl0w5mif254b2s.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lNCSfDyB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u6iczrfl0w5mif254b2s.JPG" alt="Docusaurus set up" width="445" height="51"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This is the command I use to set up my first Docusaurus project. It is pretty simple, and I choose the &lt;code&gt;classic&lt;/code&gt; option for the &lt;code&gt;[template]&lt;/code&gt;. The deployment of Docusaurus to Github page is very straightforward.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---fUMy7eb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4s61sswiuus3r6is0edq.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---fUMy7eb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4s61sswiuus3r6is0edq.JPG" alt="deploy" width="584" height="141"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This is the moment I encounter some errors. I do not realize that the original command does not work for me for some reason. After doing a lot of googling, I come up with the solution is that I have to remove the quotation mark &lt;code&gt;" "&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;"GIT_USER=&amp;lt;GITHUB_USERNAME&amp;gt;"&lt;/code&gt; , so I use the command &lt;code&gt;cmd /C "set GIT_USER=&amp;lt;GITHUB_USERNAME&amp;gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp; yarn deploy&lt;/code&gt; and it works properly. After all, I have my first Docusaurus &lt;a href="https://tcvan0707.github.io/my-website/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; successfully deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#copying-a-feature-from-docusaurus"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Copying a Feature from Docusaurus
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I catch up the concept of Docusaurus as well as knowing what it is, I choose a feature from it and add it into &lt;a href="https://github.com/tcvan0707/txt2html"&gt;my SSG&lt;/a&gt;. I file an &lt;a href="https://github.com/tcvan0707/txt2html/issues/13"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; inside my repo, which is adding &lt;strong&gt;full markdown support&lt;/strong&gt; for my SSG. The reason why I choose this is because I partially implement the heading to &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag, so I want to finish the rest in order to have full options for markdown. I create another branch for my modification, which is &lt;code&gt;issue-13&lt;/code&gt;, then modifying and push it to that branch. After all, I create a &lt;a href="https://github.com/tcvan0707/txt2html/pull/14"&gt;pull request&lt;/a&gt; for my program and then merge in to my &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; branch.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="#introduction-to-docusaurus"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction to Docusaurus
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Docusaurus is a tool designed to make it easy for teams to publish documentation websites&lt;/strong&gt; without having to worry about the infrastructure and design details. Docusaurus also provides core website and documentation features out-of-the-box including blog support, internationalization, search, and versioning. &lt;a href="https://docusaurus.io/docs"&gt;For more info&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
To anyone who wants to design a webpage without coding knowledge can use this open-source project.&lt;br&gt;
Easy to deploy and easy-to-use pre-design webpages for your website.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://japneetsingh035.github.io/docusaurus/docs/intro"&gt;Intro to docusaurus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#features-copied-from-docusaurus"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Features copied from Docusaurus
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I was impressed looking at docusaurus implementing so many features to their website. I wanted to work on Theme and Search Engine Optimization that required a lot of effort and knowledge. So, I started with some basic features that support my &lt;a href="https://github.com/japneetsingh035/ModernSSG"&gt;ModernSSG&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#approach"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Approach
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to make my Html page more supportive with Markdown. I did it by adding more supports to tags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved Accessibility of generated HTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full Markdown support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Syntax Highlighting for code blocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#future-features"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Future Features
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I would love to work on &lt;a href="https://github.com/japneetsingh035/ModernSSG/issues/20"&gt;Issues&lt;/a&gt;. If anyone is interested to practice with this static site generator feel free to reach out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#example-of-feature"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Example of feature
