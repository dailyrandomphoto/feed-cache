      <description>&lt;p&gt;Augmented reality technology has proven to be one of the top innovations opening up new growth points for businesses around the world. Analysts predict that the AR market will reach &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/591181/global-augmented-virtual-reality-market-size/"&gt;$198 billion in 2025&lt;/a&gt;. This year, the number of mobile AR users is expected to reach 3.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a large market to tap into, providing AR experiences can be a competitive edge in many industries. The improving technology also stands to allow for greater efficiency in the workplace. Let’s take a look at some of the augmented reality trends driving innovation in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#trend-1-mobile-augmented-reality-is-evolving"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Trend #1: Mobile Augmented Reality Is Evolving
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mobile augmented reality has many clear advantages that make it the center of much of the technology’s attention. Many users already own an AR capable smartphone, so there’s no need for them to go out of their way to get an expensive and bulky headset. Mobile devices, by their nature, are very portable and easy to bring into nearly any space. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pzsPBkTE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2b0d2rb3n9p1k2pcbees.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pzsPBkTE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2b0d2rb3n9p1k2pcbees.png" alt="Mobile AR 2020-2021: ARKit + ARCore" width="880" height="521"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#apple-arkit-5"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  APPLE ARKIT 5
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest version of Apple’s open source mobile augmented reality development toolset, &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/arkit/"&gt;ARKit 5&lt;/a&gt;, offers significant improvements from ARKit 4. Some of the most important enhancements include expanded support for location anchors, improved motion tracking, and greater face tracking in the ultra wide camera on the 5th generation iPad Pro. App Clip Codes also enable AR experiences that can be activated through a quick scan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Location anchors have seen improvements since they were introduced in ARKit 4. Location anchors enable enhanced AR-based navigation solutions. This allows app developers to place virtual objects with specific latitude, longitude, and altitude on the screen relative to the positions of real world objects. For example, location anchors could display a three dimensional icon or text in space next to an iconic building. Support for this feature has been expanded to London and other cities in the United States in ARKit 5. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expanded face tracking now supports all devices with the A12 Bionic chip and later, even without TrueDepth Camera, like iPhone SE, so you can reach even more users. Also face tracking is now supported by the Ultra Wide camera in the latest iPad Pro (5th generation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feature allows for tracking of up to three faces at once. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;App Clip Codes are useful QR code-like images that can be scanned to start up a lightweight portion of an app. Integrating this feature with ARKit allows for augmented reality experiences to be started up from anywhere without having to download additional software. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business owners looking to build apps that utilize &lt;a href="https://mobidev.biz/blog/arkit-guide-augmented-reality-app-development-ios"&gt;ARKit may find our ARKit Development Guide&lt;/a&gt; useful for getting an overview of how they can achieve their goals.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#arcore"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ARCORE
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Android equivalent of ARKit, ARCore provides the open source native tool set needed for developers to create augmented reality apps on Android devices. It is generally seen as being a bit of a different challenge than ARKit due to the fact that special attention should be paid to the wide variety of hardware that exists on devices running Android. Because of this, certain features may not be compatible with all Android devices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past year, Google introduced a few new features for ARCore such as recording and playback APIs. These enable developers to record video footage with AR metadata. By using depth and IMU motion sensor data, developers can recreate the same environment as in the video and use it for further testing. This opens up the opportunity for developers to more easily test specific environments with their software. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recording and playback API isn’t just useful for developers, but for users as well. This technology makes it possible for users to record video and then apply AR effects later on since video can contain environmental metadata. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#arkit-vs-arcore"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ARKIT VS ARCORE
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The battle between ARKit and ARCore isn’t as clear cut as you might think. ARKit appears to have the best compatibility between software and hardware, as Apple is responsible for all aspects of their devices. However, not every user in the market owns an iPhone or iPad. ARCore is just as important to focus on due to user accessibility. Although support is not guaranteed for every Android device due to variation in hardware, including as many users as possible is important for remaining competitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PtbPEvun--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/axuwwp1ct76z4q8qvd34.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PtbPEvun--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/axuwwp1ct76z4q8qvd34.png" alt="Comparison of ARKit and ARCore features in 2022" width="880" height="506"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of actual performance, the technology behind these two frameworks is almost the same. For example, for applications like scene detection, the two technologies use the same methods, differing most significantly in hardware. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’d like to learn more about technologies and platforms for AR applications, read the MobiDev Experts’ Guide to &lt;a href="https://mobidev.biz/blog/augmented-reality-development-guide"&gt;Developing Augmented Reality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#trend-2-powering-indoor-and-outdoor-navigation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Trend #2: Powering Indoor and Outdoor Navigation
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, &lt;a href="https://mobidev.biz/blog/augmented-reality-indoor-navigation-app-developement-arkit"&gt;AR navigation&lt;/a&gt; has become more fluid and achievable than ever before. Most importantly, the rise of technologies like Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) antennas, Wi-Fi RTT and ultra wideband (UWB) make indoor navigation much more viable than in previous years. One of the most useful applications of this technology is for displaying AR directions in large indoor locations like distribution centers, shopping malls, and airports. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch the demo below to find out how MobiDev implemented mobile AR for navigation of the corporate campus.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VmROm6nbElA"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something that shouldn’t be overlooked is this technology’s potential to be used by both consumer and business users. Just as a guest in a store may use AR indoor navigation to find the product they’re looking for, a distribution center worker may use it to find a particular item in their warehouse. Although comfortable and affordable glasses with AR capability aren’t quite here yet, the capacity for the business applications of AR in distribution centers, stores, and other sectors is there. One of the leading device manufacturers, Zebra, has ARCore-capable mobile enterprise devices such as the TC52, TC57, and TC77. These are essentially Android-powered smartphones with barcode scanners intended for business use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With indoor navigation, buy online pick up in store (BOPIS) services can be made much more efficient. Team members tasked to ‘pick’ the items in the store for order fulfillment can use AR directions to directly navigate to find the item as opposed to following coordinate directions to find the item. This eliminates time spent looking through many similar items and finding the correct aisle and section of the store. All the team member has to do is hold up their device and see the directions on screen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some limitations that need to be taken into account, such as items that have been misplaced around the store. If they have been moved by guests or incorrectly logged into the system, the team member might use AR navigation on their device to arrive at an empty spot on a shelf. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#trend-3-healthcare-and-augmented-reality"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Trend #3: Healthcare and Augmented Reality
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/life-sciences-and-healthcare/articles/global-health-care-sector-outlook.html"&gt;Deloitte Research&lt;/a&gt;, augmented reality and AI will transform the traditional healthcare business model by offering AR/MR-enabled hands-free solutions and IA-based diagnostic tools. For example, Microsoft Hololens 2 can provide information to the surgeon while allowing them to use both of their hands during the procedure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the continued restrictions associated with Covid-19, the use of augmented reality solutions is becoming increasingly important to address issues such as the complexity of remote patient support and the increased burden on hospitals. This includes both telesurgery solutions and mental health apps that are helping people to maintain psychological balance during these difficult times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AR technology can also improve telemedicine solutions that are on the rise right now. Features such as drawing and annotating on the 3D screen can make communication between doctors and patients much easier and clearer. Remote assistance tools can also help clinicians support their patients while reducing downtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combining with &lt;a href="https://mobidev.biz/blog/5-essential-machine-learning-techniques"&gt;machine learning algorithms&lt;/a&gt;, AR technology can become an efficient option for disease detection. Back in 2020, Google announced the development of an AR-based microscope for the Department of Defense (DoD) to improve the accuracy of cancer diagnosis and treatment. Such a hybrid device uses a camera to capture images in real time, which are then processed using computer diagnostics to immediately display results and diagnose diseases at an early stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.researchdive.com/covid-19-insights/218/global-augmented-reality-ar-in-healthcare-market"&gt;Research Dive&lt;/a&gt;, the global augmented reality (AR) in the healthcare market is expected to generate $1,918.6 million by 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn how AR and other innovative technologies are being used in healthcare by reading &lt;a href="https://mobidev.biz/blog/technology-trends-healthcare-digital-transformation"&gt;Health Technology Trends and Digital Innovation in 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#trend-4-augmented-reality-shopping-experiences"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Trend #4: Augmented Reality Shopping Experiences
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Augmented reality has numerous opportunities in the &lt;a href="https://mobidev.biz/blog/augmented-reality-marketing-sales"&gt;retail sector&lt;/a&gt;. One of these opportunities that is currently being realized is store mapping. With augmented reality, on-screen directions can help a user navigate the layout of the store to find the item that they need. Dent Reality is one of the companies developing AR mapping systems for stores. All the user has to do is hold their phone up and follow the augmented reality directions through the aisles to their destination: the item they’re looking for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, AR in retail doesn’t stop at navigation in 2022. In fact, it can help users shop in stores and from home. For example, AR-based marketing materials can not only improve the engagement of your audience but also increase the likelihood of purchases. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At MobiDev, we’ve created a demo that shows how a solution like augmented reality business cards can influence purchasing decisions by interactively presenting information about your products and services.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u8njnXc7ziY"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Augmented reality is also very useful for helping customers ‘test’ products before purchasing. Stores like Ikea and Target have already rolled out apps that allow users to use AR to see how furniture will fit in their homes. Many stores like Target, Sephora, and others are also using virtual try-on solutions to allow guests to test products like makeup, glasses, and even other types of clothing like shoes. Most importantly, this can be done in store or at home. As AR technology matures, the &lt;a href="https://instasize.com/blog/5-fundamentals-to-boost-your-customer-focus"&gt;comfort of consumers&lt;/a&gt; will only increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mobile &lt;a href="https://mobidev.biz/blog/ar-ai-technologies-virtual-fitting-room-development"&gt;virtual fitting room technology&lt;/a&gt; improves, so do in-store smart mirrors. In 2011, Topshop used virtual mirrors powered by Xbox Kinect 3D cameras. It was a great proof of concept that preceded more advanced use-cases today with better graphics and processing. According to &lt;a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/press-release/virtual-fitting-room-vfr-market-9531#:~:text=The%20global%20virtual%20fitting%20room%20market%20size%20is,as%20gamification%2C%20product%20information%2C%20content%2C%20and%20augmented%20environments."&gt;Fortune Business Insights&lt;/a&gt;, the virtual fitting room market size was valued at $3.5 billion in 2021. It is expected to grow to $12.97 billion by 2028.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#trend-5-augmented-reality-and-remote-assistance"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Trend #5: Augmented Reality and Remote Assistance
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Augmented reality can greatly improve user experiences with assistance and learning. According to &lt;a href="https://resources.owllabs.com/state-of-remote-work/2020"&gt;Owl Labs&lt;/a&gt;, in 2020 nearly 70% of workers in the U.S. working full time, &lt;a href="https://www.sweetprocess.com/work-from-home/"&gt;work from home&lt;/a&gt;. With video conferencing being the lifeblood of telework, various problems emerge. How can we compensate for the lost context and benefits of meeting in the ‘real world?’ &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we use video conferencing, we lose an entire dimension of context, moving into two dimensional space instead of three. This can negatively impact jobs like IT technical support. Teleconferencing is limited, only allowing IT specialists to make suggestions so that the user can fix the problem on their own before they choose to send their device into the office for repairs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ar-in-action-3d-video-call-assistance"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AR IN ACTION: 3D VIDEO CALL ASSISTANCE
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Augmented reality software can help at least partially restore that lost dimension of space back into the conversation. AR can allow IT technicians to give guidance to users with 3D on-screen directions. As the user holds their smartphone camera up to their computer in need of service, the IT technician can draw over the screen to direct the customer to certain points of interest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We developed a solution that does just that. You can see it in action in the video below.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/11NiyGoKOrk"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experiences like this can be constructed with WebRTC. This allows for both parties to connect to one another and see the same AR experience via a peer-to-peer connection. This is essential to make sure that the video is sent in real time without causing debilitating server load. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ar-in-action-virtual-manuals"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AR IN ACTION: VIRTUAL MANUALS
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a slight departure from telework, virtual manuals are a compelling technology used in various industries to improve user satisfaction and understanding of products. It also has many applications in education. With object recognition, AR guides can identify objects and inform the user about their functions. This can make for effective guides for products like consumer electronics, vehicle interiors, and more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The MobiDev demo below demonstrates this technology in action with a coffee machine. The AR guide in the video gives more context about the coffee machine’s capabilities and provides additional instructions all on the user’s smartphone.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6ceN7YgSEdU"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#trend-6-augmented-reality-in-automotive-industries"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Trend #6: Augmented Reality in Automotive Industries
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AR technology has had profound impacts on vehicle safety and usability. Tesla Motors has demonstrated the possibilities of AR for the road. Although they haven’t implemented it as many might imagine with headsets, they have used almost identical technologies to make it possible. With the Full Self-Driving Beta now on the road and used by many consumers, drivers can see how the vehicle’s advanced suite of cameras consistently analyze the world around them using object detection and scene analysis. The results of this powerful system can be seen on the display of the vehicle, showcasing the car’s position in space relative to the many obstacles around it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#heads-up-display"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  HEADS UP DISPLAY
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, AR has other possible applications for drivers. It could help provide drivers with a heads up display (HUD) via a headset to give them safety information without obstructing their field of vision. With eye tracking, this kind of system and similar non-headset based solutions can help keep drivers focused on the road with auditory reminders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://varjo.com/testimonial/xr-test-drive-with-volvo/"&gt;Volvo Varjo XR-1 headset&lt;/a&gt; is used for a proof of concept AR driver’s education system that can help drivers learn to respond defensively to obstacles that appear on the road without having the risk of the object actually being present. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#automotive-sales"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AUTOMOTIVE SALES
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like in other contexts, AR is an effective sales tool that can help sell cars even while the user is at home. Similar to how one can spawn IKEA furniture in their living room with AR, one can also generate a 3D model of a car in their driveway with their smartphone. The consumer can inspect the size and details of the vehicle, and even watch it move around. Perhaps most strikingly, it’s possible for the user to change the color of the vehicle to see which color they would prefer when purchasing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#trend-7-ar-glasses-future-or-fiction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Trend #7: AR Glasses, Future or Fiction?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Augmented reality glasses and headsets have an interesting reputation. Although they are widely seen as the future of AR technology and have been tested and utilized in real world applications, they haven’t quite made the mainstream just yet. If they’ve made a landing point anywhere, it has been for enterprise and business solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;a href="https://mobidev.biz/blog/microsoft-hololens-demo"&gt;Microsoft’s HoloLens 2&lt;/a&gt; mixed reality headset is not priced or marketed for consumers, it is in use with the military and with medical practitioners for surgeries and training. The Synthetic Training Environment (STE) used by the US Army uses AR and VR to help immerse soldiers and simulate various scenarios. Australian aircraft technicians are now using Microsoft HoloLens with Boeing-developed software to maintain aircrafts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check the video below to see the HoloLens in action!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vnVZhIRvyp0"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, these headsets are far too bulky to be used by non-enterprise users, and the failure of Google Glass for consumers showed that we are a long way off from lightweight, comfortable to wear ‘AR glasses’. However, Google Glass launched eight years ago. Are we any closer now? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Glass Enterprise Edition 2 is in use by various businesses like DHL for order fulfillment. There are also plenty of rumors about AR glasses being made by companies like Apple but there isn’t much word on a comfortable to use, affordable and ‘normal’ looking pair of glasses that will take the consumer market by storm. That being said, ARtillery Intelligence expects that the market for this technology will grow from $822 million to $13.4 billion by 2024. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#trend-8-the-metaverse-live-events-and-social-upheaval"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Trend #8: The Metaverse, Live Events, and Social Upheaval
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook may have taken the Internet by storm with its rebrand to Meta, but the concept of the Metaverse and upheaval of digital communication with extended reality space has been around for some time. The term originated in Neal Stephenson’s 1992 Snow Crash science fiction novel, perhaps speculating the eventual result of how large corporations take more and more control over the lives of consumers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to be cautious of the effects of this shift in the market toward increasingly digital and virtual reality spaces, but ultimately the benefits of this technology can be profoundly helpful and provide businesses competitive advantages in many industries. Although the metaverse is very focused on VR spaces, the movement will likely transform &lt;a href="https://mobidev.biz/blog/how-to-create-augmented-reality-app-for-business-cost-process-flow"&gt;AR’s use in business&lt;/a&gt; and consumer contexts as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#arpowered-meetings"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AR-POWERED MEETINGS
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main pitches that Meta offered with its rebranding was the use of ‘metaverse’ technology to improve the way that we work through teleconferencing and hybrid meetings. The ultimate goal of this is to break down the barriers of traditional &lt;a href="https://biz30.timedoctor.com/how-to-use-zoom/"&gt;Zoom video conferencing&lt;/a&gt; and bring the third dimension back into the conversation, as well as human expression and inclusiveness. Microsoft Mesh is a project with HoloLens that helps enable hybrid meetings that enable VR and AR features. Users can see other teleconferencing users in 3D space by viewing their cartoon avatar or a floating box with their video camera. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#web-ar-better-accessibility-to-ar-features-comes-with-compromise"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  WEB AR: BETTER ACCESSIBILITY TO AR FEATURES COMES WITH COMPROMISE
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One particular trend in enabling better access to AR features is Web AR. This has been used for various purposes like virtual career fairs, &lt;a href="https://mobidev.biz/blog/augmented-reality-demo-marketing-brand-promotion"&gt;animated business cards&lt;/a&gt;, and sporting events. By powering an AR experience completely within a mobile device’s browser, the user doesn’t need to download any external applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this comes at a great cost. Web AR does not have access to the full scope of the device’s capabilities. This means that the quality and use-cases of web AR are very limited. For more advanced use of AR, we recommend you consider a native approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--53sX54WV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/07ppery3k64a22tw5jlx.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--53sX54WV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/07ppery3k64a22tw5jlx.png" alt="AR-compitable Devices and Active Users 2020-2021" width="880" height="408"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Although there are hundreds of millions of WebAR capable mobile devices out there, very few users actively use these experiences.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#trend-9-ar-in-education"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Trend #9: AR In Education
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve already touched on AR in education a little bit in this article with AR guides. With educational institutions being hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, momentum for innovation in this space has increased. Teams like Wikitude have created apps like &lt;a href="https://www.wikitude.com/showcase/teaching-programming-with-ar/"&gt;Ai.R-Cord&lt;/a&gt; with the objective of helping elementary school students learn concepts with AR experiences and this is not the only example. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AR in education simplifies the perception of information and leverages technology to enable teachers to demonstrate virtual examples and gamify the learning process. This increases student engagement and speeds up the process of mastering the materials. For example, the Chem101 AR app helps students understand complex compounds in chemistry. Using special cards, students can virtually modify molecular structures and receive real-time information about them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Augmented reality based apps can also give students access to unique learning environments that are difficult or even dangerous to experience in real life without proper preparation. For example, some apps help medical students learn more about human anatomy through AR visualization and 3D models, and even allow them to simulate surgeries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to classroom teaching, AR can also be used in employee training. This technology allows you to train your employees in a safe environment with less cost and higher efficiency. AR apps give an employee the opportunity not only to read about how something works, but to learn how to do it by making actions. Siemens and Japan Airlines have already resorted to this practice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AR has every chance of increasing its presence in the education market in the coming  years. Compared to VR, augmented reality offers more cost-effective options with the same benefits. All students need is an Internet connection, a smartphone or tablet, and augmented reality applications. There is no need to buy expensive equipment like a virtual reality headset. According to Statista, 83.96% of the world’s population owns a smartphone, which provides a favorable environment for adopting an AR experience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.factmr.com/report/ar-in-education-market"&gt;Fact.MR forecasts&lt;/a&gt;, AR in the education market is projected to witness exponential growth over the coming years, reaching $85 Bn by 2031.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#trend-10-improving-mobile-ar-hardware-amp-lidar"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Trend #10: Improving Mobile AR Hardware &amp;amp; LiDAR
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One popular trend in the augmented reality industry is improving hardware for mobile devices. In particular, Apple’s famous LiDAR sensor on its iPhone 12 Pro, 12 Pro Max, 13 Pro, and 13 Pro Max smartphones as well as iPad Pro. By using infrared lasers, smartphones like Apple’s can determine the depth of scenes with more precision than ever before. This can make analysis of scenes for AR experiences better than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Android phones use this technology as well with flash-based scannerless LiDAR. Samsung’s DepthVision uses a single flash of infrared light to analyze the depth of the scene. Once that’s done, a 3D map of the scene can be created. On the other hand, Apple offers a scanning LiDAR system. This uses time of flight (TOF) and continuously scans an area over time with various IR pulses in different areas of the scene. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aforementioned Apple and Android devices are relatively comparable in their performance in delivering AR experiences to users. However, at the moment, it’s important to consider accessibility. LiDAR hardware is only available on higher end Apple products and Android devices, meaning that the vast majority of AR consumers will only have access to a certain level of quality. Developing applications with this in mind is critical to relevancy in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#future-of-augmented-reality"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Future of Augmented Reality
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the AR industry continuing to climb in market value, augmented reality’s potential cannot be denied. Importantly, it’s clear that AR’s influence extends far beyond just gaming. It now extends to many different industries as demonstrated by the following chart: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KaCgKBTp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d4kg4rif9h3q25qk59gc.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KaCgKBTp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d4kg4rif9h3q25qk59gc.png" alt="Future of Augmented Reality: Expected revenue by Industry by 2025" width="720" height="840"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although gaming still has the highest share of industry revenue and will remain a relevant driver of AR, practical uses like in healthcare, engineering, and sales will continue to gain traction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real estate and corporate campus navigation will benefit from AR solutions as well. The growing trend of the ‘metaverse’ will also help accelerate hybridization of telework and virtual meetings with AR technologies. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A recipe sharing web app with Django and React</title>
      <author>Hannah</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 18:51:39 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/earthcomfy/a-recipe-sharing-web-app-with-django-and-react-1n40</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone. I've built a recipe sharing app using Django rest framework and React.js. This application has taught me a lot and wanted to share it with you guys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#main-technologies-used-for-the-project"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Main technologies used for the project
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Django, Django rest framework&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;React.js, Redux, TailwindCSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#some-of-the-features"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Some of the features
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JWT based user registration and login.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CRUD endpoints for recipes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Like and bookmark feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unit testing on the backend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation of the API using &lt;code&gt;drf_spectacular&lt;/code&gt; which supports OAS3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;=&amp;gt; There are some things to be fixed on the frontend and other features will be added soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#screenshots-and-gifs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Screenshots and GIFs
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YE5IJOx1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ca5plg2vrlur6r7g251d.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YE5IJOx1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ca5plg2vrlur6r7g251d.gif" alt="Landing Page" width="880" height="382"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The frontend and backend are hosted separately on &lt;strong&gt;Netlify&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Heroku&lt;/strong&gt; respectively. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://mesob-recipe.netlify.app/"&gt;https://mesob-recipe.netlify.app/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can test the endpoints here: &lt;a href="https://recipe-backend-api.herokuapp.com/"&gt;https://recipe-backend-api.herokuapp.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like the project, give it a star on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Link to GitHub repo: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Backend:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/earthcomfy/recipe-api"&gt;https://github.com/earthcomfy/recipe-api&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Frontend:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/earthcomfy/react-recipe-app"&gt;https://github.com/earthcomfy/react-recipe-app&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; If you guys would like to see a tutorial on how some of the features are done, especially on the integration of Django and React, let me know in the comments section down below. I'll make sure to write a detailed article about the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any suggestions and feedbacks are welcome. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Polyfills in JavaScript 🔧⚙</title>
      <author>Suryaraj Bhaduri</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 18:05:19 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/suryaraj1/polyfills-in-javascript-13kd</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/suryaraj1/polyfills-in-javascript-13kd</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Who doesn't want their web apps to perform flawlessly across all web browsers i.e be &lt;strong&gt;cross-browser compatible&lt;/strong&gt;! But with more and more new features coming to JavaScript, many old browsers now do not have support for all of them.❗💀&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polyfills&lt;/strong&gt; is the solution to the problem.🌈✨&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prerequisites"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Prerequisites
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic JavaScript (if, else, for-loops, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; keyword&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prototype (can read from this &lt;a href="https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-prototype/"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher order functions e.x &lt;code&gt;map()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;filter()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;reduce()&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will to learn 🚀&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-a-polyfill"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is a Polyfill?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polyfill&lt;/strong&gt; is a piece of code that is used to bring support for newer features in older browsers that currently do not have native support for these features.&lt;br&gt;
For example, suppose JavaScript releases a new function, say &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; as a part of their language iteration. Now some older browsers might not have support for this function. But we developers would want our apps to be cross-browser compatible. Polyfills help us in making this possible with custom code.👨‍💻&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note📝- To code the polyfill for any feature, one must first be aware of the internal workings and specifications of the same.⚙&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#polyfill-demo"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Polyfill Demo 🚀
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enough talk, we need some code now.🤓👨‍💻&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the sake of this blog we would be coding polyfills of three higher-order functions which were added to JavaScript as a part of ES5, namely &lt;code&gt;map()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;filter()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;reduce()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;❌ &lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt; - By no means should this be considered a guide to using the aforementioned higher-order functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, take a look at the following image for a refresher of these functions if you're feeling a bit rusty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZCsjRBRf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8twv4je0nn21kgli4fia.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZCsjRBRf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8twv4je0nn21kgli4fia.jpg" alt="Higher Order Functions" width="880" height="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#polyfill-for-map"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Polyfill for Map
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;code&gt;map()&lt;/code&gt; method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array - MDN Web Docs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's look at the following code. The code here is for -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;computing squares of numbers of a given array&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;alternate casing of characters of a string (if the index is even , the character should be in uppercase else lowercase, e.x. &lt;code&gt;polyfill&lt;/code&gt; =&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;PoLyFiLl&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2YOveO5q--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ld3ttde02vnr2wogghwl.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2YOveO5q--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ld3ttde02vnr2wogghwl.png" alt="Map code" width="880" height="426"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the fun part🌈!!&lt;br&gt;
Let's code the basic polyfill i.e our custom implementation for the &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the following code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--10m1gZad--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/se9s45ewexdd2ir7wjsv.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--10m1gZad--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/se9s45ewexdd2ir7wjsv.png" alt="Basic map polyfill" width="880" height="420"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉Steps to code the polyfill for &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; - &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a clear understanding of how &lt;code&gt;map()&lt;/code&gt; works&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a function, which here we have named &lt;code&gt;customMap&lt;/code&gt; and attach it to &lt;code&gt;Array.prototype&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pass a function as an argument that would be run over every element (this resembles the &lt;code&gt;callback&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new array that is initially empty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loop over every element of the array using &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; and push every new element to the new array&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally return the output array&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voila!! 🎉🎉 You're ready with your first polyfill!!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's put our &lt;code&gt;customMap&lt;/code&gt; to the test.🚀🚀&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PgwzguO6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rdykg3iuye4l8nk6acfq.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PgwzguO6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rdykg3iuye4l8nk6acfq.png" alt="Polyfill map use" width="880" height="526"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our polyfill passed the test i.e it yields the same results as the original &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; function.✅✅&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, let's move to the &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#polyfill-for-filter"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Polyfill for Filter
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;code&gt;filter()&lt;/code&gt; method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. - MDN Web Docs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's look at the following code. The code here is for - &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;filtering out all odd numbers from a given array of numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--M534RhVj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ggjhw56imrkj0gj2u4q0.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--M534RhVj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ggjhw56imrkj0gj2u4q0.png" alt="Filter code" width="880" height="371"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, time to code the basic polyfill for the &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt; function.🌈&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at the following code for better understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YUGe7DOG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/y0gntzar4nmdvm6u5q9a.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YUGe7DOG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/y0gntzar4nmdvm6u5q9a.png" alt="Basic Filter polyfill" width="880" height="349"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉Steps to code our &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt; polyfill - &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a clear understanding of &lt;code&gt;filter()&lt;/code&gt; and how it works&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a function, which here we have named &lt;code&gt;customFilter&lt;/code&gt; and attach it to &lt;code&gt;Array.prototype&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pass a function as an argument that would be run for each element &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new empty array to store the filtered items&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loop over the array items using &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; and push only those items to the new array which satisfy the test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally return the output array containing filtered items&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Superb!!🎉🎉 You have coded your &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt; polyfill!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to the above, let's put our &lt;code&gt;customFilter&lt;/code&gt; to the test.😅&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--S5Mh8hcq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/32lt62lwp8vaddcn53po.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--S5Mh8hcq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/32lt62lwp8vaddcn53po.png" alt="Filter polyfill run" width="880" height="344"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our polyfill for &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt; yields the same result as using the inbuilt &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt; function!!✅✅&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've almost reached the end of the blog.🏁 Next, we would quickly cover the &lt;code&gt;reduce&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#polyfill-for-reduce"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Polyfill for Reduce
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;code&gt;reduce()&lt;/code&gt; method executes a user-supplied “reducer” callback function on each element of the array, in order, passing in the return value from the calculation on the preceding element. The final result of running the reducer across all elements of the array is a single value. - MDN Web Docs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's look at the code below. The code here -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;computes the sum of all elements of an array&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_V3srtO8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lp0c4whcvm1pke2ygt9i.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_V3srtO8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lp0c4whcvm1pke2ygt9i.png" alt="Reduce code" width="880" height="268"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's try and write the basic polyfill for &lt;code&gt;reduce&lt;/code&gt; function. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;✔Recommended&lt;/strong&gt; - First try on your own and then proceed to the code below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pIGVrWS0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/griiun46mvz9a6ibqmpb.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pIGVrWS0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/griiun46mvz9a6ibqmpb.png" alt="Polyfill for reduce" width="880" height="365"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's try testing whether our polyfill code works or not!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WtdezfFJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hwy94ikqfkom4an6erx1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WtdezfFJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hwy94ikqfkom4an6erx1.png" alt="Reduce polyfill run" width="880" height="321"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Awesome!! 🎉🎉 This also yields the same result as before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you made it this far, pat your back. You're awesome!🌈🚀&lt;/p&gt;

  Bonus🦄 - History of Polyfill
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The name Polyfill comes from the name of a product used to cover cracks and holes on a wall, called &lt;em&gt;Polyfilla&lt;/em&gt;. The term was coined by Remy Sharp while writing his book "Introducing HTML5" back in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📕Can read more about this - &lt;a href="https://remysharp.com/2010/10/08/what-is-a-polyfill"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congratulations!!&lt;/strong&gt; 🎉🎉 You made it till the end. If you're still here chances are you probably liked the blog. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am still learning Polyfills. Hope this blog gave you a decent introduction to what they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do let me know how you liked the blog and where I need to improve. Would be eagerly waiting for feedback!🙂&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Types of Angular Module</title>
      <author>Anubhab Mukherjee</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 17:44:35 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/this-is-angular/types-of-angular-module-amd</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/this-is-angular/types-of-angular-module-amd</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today we will understand about the different types of modules you can have in an application. If you are not aware of Angular Modules then I would suggest you to go through this  &lt;a href="https://dev.to/this-is-angular/understanding-angular-modules-41pb"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;. Also you need to know how to create your own module. For that you can have a look at this &lt;a href="https://dev.to/this-is-angular/creating-custom-module-in-angular-4p66"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📣 &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This will be more of theory where we will understand the requirement of different types of modules. It can be different puzzle pieces for you as of now. But in coming posts I will cover all the module type with example. And then you will be able to see the puzzle completed. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Before diving deep first lets understand why we need various types of modules. (By the way one of the module type we already saw in the earlier &lt;a href="https://dev.to/this-is-angular/creating-custom-module-in-angular-4p66"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;br&gt;
As your application grows in size you need to break/ group the application into various chunks for -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;maintainability&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;enhance the performance&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;scalability&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;easy deployment&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;enhance the development process&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To meet the above requirement &lt;code&gt;module&lt;/code&gt; can be a key player (best friend).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;strong&gt;six&lt;/strong&gt; (6) types of modules an application can have (depending on the requirement. Not necessary an application should have all the six)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1️⃣ Root Module (🔴 Mandatory 🔴)&lt;br&gt;
2️⃣ Feature Module (🟡 Optional 🟡)&lt;br&gt;
3️⃣ Routing Module ( 🟡 Optional 🟡)&lt;br&gt;
4️⃣ Service Module (🟡 Optional 🟡)&lt;br&gt;
5️⃣ Widget Module (🟡 Optional 🟡)&lt;br&gt;
6️⃣ Shared Module (🟡 Optional 🟡)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1️⃣ &lt;strong&gt;Root Module&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I bet you have already seen a glimpse of this module.&lt;br&gt;
When you create an Angular application for the first time you are provided with a module &lt;code&gt;app.module.ts&lt;/code&gt; remember???&lt;br&gt;
This is the root module (you can think this as the parent, all other modules will be directly or indirectly part of this module.&lt;br&gt;
Only &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; root module is allowed in an application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2️⃣ &lt;strong&gt;Feature Module&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In a large application (say an eCommerce application like amazon) with multiple different features you need to break the application into smaller chunks depending on the features (like users, product, payment etc.)&lt;br&gt;
These smaller chunks can be grouped under modules known as the Feature module.&lt;br&gt;
As an analogy you can think like you have a parent folder called entertainment under that you have different subcategory or folders like music, movies, games, photos etc. This subfolders you can think as feature module. All related items are grouped under one module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3️⃣ &lt;strong&gt;Routing Module&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When an application has the navigation feature (more than one screen to display) then the routing module comes into play. In this scenario the Routing module is &lt;strong&gt;required&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
If you are interested to know more about routing module you can have a look at this &lt;a href="https://dev.to/anubhab5/setting-up-angular-routing-from-scratch-1i07"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4️⃣ &lt;strong&gt;Service Module&lt;/strong&gt; - (I will talk in detail very soon)&lt;br&gt;
Modules that contain only services (can be utility services).&lt;br&gt;
The service module must be present only at the &lt;strong&gt;root module&lt;/strong&gt; .&lt;br&gt;
Once I talk about services this part would be more clearer to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5️⃣ &lt;strong&gt;Widget Module&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The third party UI component library module which exposes components/ pipes/ directives (in the export array) can be considered as widget module.&lt;br&gt;
For example you have built a table component and you want to share it with other teams in your org. The module which contains the table component can be considered as a widget module.&lt;br&gt;
The other team would be importing your module and use the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6️⃣ &lt;strong&gt;Shared Module&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The commonly used components/ directives/ pipes which are used across the application in different modules are put in a special module called the &lt;code&gt;shared module&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Now consider you have made a table component. This table component need to be used in different screens of &lt;u&gt;your&lt;/u&gt; application across different modules. The only way you can do is by using the &lt;em&gt;Shared Module&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoyed reading the post (only theory but this knowledge will be helpful in the coming days. Trust Me)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you liked it please do &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;share&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;comment&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming up next &lt;em&gt;Communication between components&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
So stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Anubhab_0905"&gt;tweeting&lt;/a&gt; more on &lt;code&gt;Angular&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;JavaScript&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;TypeScript&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;CSS&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So hope to see you there too 😃&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cheers&lt;/strong&gt;!!!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Happy Coding&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Access the Windows file system through WSL!</title>
      <author>Ivaylo Ivanov</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 17:38:34 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/ivayloiv/access-the-windows-file-system-through-wsl-1ac4</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/ivayloiv/access-the-windows-file-system-through-wsl-1ac4</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered, how to access the windows file system through WSL? If the answer is yes you are in the right place!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft WSL has given us an incredible way to access the windows file system, you have just to navigate through an exact path to do it. Without further due, let's dive into the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-use-the-cd-command-in-the-linux-terminal"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Use the &lt;strong&gt;cd&lt;/strong&gt; command in the Linux terminal.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To access the windows files you have to navigate through &lt;strong&gt;/mnt/your_windows_path&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; /mnt/c/Users
&lt;span class="k"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;OR&lt;span class="k"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; /mnt/d/your_folder/your_folder
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now you have access to every file in the Linux and Windows file systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-moving-files-between-the-two-systems-through-wsl"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Moving files between the two systems through WSL.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to move files between the two operating systems you can simply use the &lt;strong&gt;cp&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;mv&lt;/strong&gt; commands. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;cp&lt;/strong&gt; - command for copying files&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;mv&lt;/strong&gt; - command for moving files&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Use of cp command&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cp&lt;/span&gt; /mnt/c/file.txt /home/username/Documents
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use of mv command&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;mv&lt;/span&gt;  /mnt/c/file.txt /home/username/Documents
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-editing-windows-files-through-wsl"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Editing windows files through WSL.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To edit windows files through the Linux terminal using WSL, you have to use any text editor that can be opened in the terminal. One of the most famous text editors is &lt;strong&gt;nano&lt;/strong&gt;. In our example, I am going to use the &lt;strong&gt;nano&lt;/strong&gt; editor.&lt;br&gt;
Type into the terminal &lt;strong&gt;nano&lt;/strong&gt; and the path to the file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;nano /mnt/c/Users/file.txt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now you can edit freely files from your terminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-creating-files-in-windows-through-wsl"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Creating files in windows through WSL.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a file in a specific windows directory you have first to navigate to it and then use the &lt;strong&gt;touch&lt;/strong&gt; command to create a file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;touch&lt;/strong&gt; - a command that creates a file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;!!! The file extension can be anything you want.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; /mnt/c/Users/Public/Documents/ 
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;touch &lt;/span&gt;filename.txt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The file is created and can be opened from both systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-deleting-files-from-the-windows-file-system-through-wsl"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Deleting files from the windows file system through WSL.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To delete windows files using WSL, you have to navigate to the directory where the file lives and use the &lt;strong&gt;rm&lt;/strong&gt; command.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;rm&lt;/strong&gt; - a command that deletes files / directories&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; /mnt/c/Users/Public
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo rm &lt;/span&gt;example_file.jpg
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Congratulations you learned 5 vital skills about working with the Linux terminal. 🎺🎺🎺&lt;br&gt;
If you have any questions, comment down, I will answer as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JavaScript Project</title>
      <author>victoriaehrbar</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 17:34:42 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/victoriaehrbar/javascript-project-4j99</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/victoriaehrbar/javascript-project-4j99</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I finished my phase 4 project for Flatiron School! I created a single-page web application for my JavaScript project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created 2 separate repos for the &lt;a href="https://github.com/victoriaehrbar/book_review_frontend"&gt;front end&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/victoriaehrbar/book_review_backend"&gt;back end&lt;/a&gt;. The back end was fairly similar to the phase 3 Rails project, with controllers, models, and has_many relationships. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My project was a book review/tracker, where a user can input a title, author, description, and category/genre. A category has_many books and a book belongs_to a category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it was interesting to create a mini Rails project and review some old material, I was most interested in the front end JavaScript portion and refining what I learned in phase 4. I utilized the fetch method to get the book data to display on the page, display new posts, and to delete posts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The back end part of the project required creating a Rails API, which was interesting as the phase 3 Rails project did not incorporate this. The front end JavaScript portion of this project communicates with the API for the front end and back end to work together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In JavaScript, event listeners are used to create actions. For example, my project has an attachDeleteButtonListener, which lets the server know that when the delete button is clicked, that book entry should be removed from the page. There is also another event listener that lets the page know to create a new book when "submit" is clicked on the new book form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the JavaScript project was a great fusion of Rails and JavaScript that allowed me to synthesize my JavaScript knowledge and create a fun single-page web application.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Upcoming Solana NFT Projects - Moonly</title>
      <author>Stefan Smiljkovic</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 16:34:01 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/shtefcs/upcoming-solana-nft-projects-moonly-353</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/shtefcs/upcoming-solana-nft-projects-moonly-353</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#upcoming-solana-nft-projects-moonly"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Upcoming Solana NFT Projects — Moonly
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--acS48op8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2864/0%2Akipawkqw35p9mwYz" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--acS48op8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2864/0%2Akipawkqw35p9mwYz" alt="" width="880" height="570"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good day, good people! After a short break from sharing my progress update for Automatio, I’m back with a new project. Meanwhile, I married and became a father, (minted) a beautiful girl called Mila.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may know already, I devote time to building a no-code web automation tool called Automatio (a powerful web scraper and bot builder). But I also dived into Solana NFT blockchain development a couple of months ago. And despite the challenges, it’s been an exciting ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#but-quickly-whats-an-nft"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  But Quickly, What’s an NFT?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NFT stands for non-fungible token. An NFT can be any physical item made available for sale digitally. This can be a painting, music, or any other sellable. And by non-fungible, it means an NFT isn’t replaceable, even with any other similar item. It’s essentially unique and tagged to the maker’s identity. In essence, no two same NFTs can exist at the same time. Each NFT item is identified in a blockchain using a unique token generated at the point of minting. And that’s why they call them non-fungible tokens, which means they’re non-replicable as each of them possesses a unique certificate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minting, however, means creating an NFT item on a digital platform such as Solana to put it out for sale. NFTs exist on blockchains and are available for sales in cryptocurrencies. When you sell an NFT as the author, you invest in a lifetime passive income as the unique token trails your creation. So even whenever buyers resell your item, you get a certain percentage, called a royalty (determined by you), on each sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#moonly"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Moonly
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, friends, I present to you, for the first time, &lt;a href="https://moon.ly"&gt;**Moonly&lt;/a&gt;**, the Solana blockchain project that has captured my time and passion. With a regularly updated database of trending NFT projects, it helps you recommend the best upcoming NFT projects worth investing in on Solana.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been on to NFT for some years now, and I know how difficult it can be to decide what NFT project is worth the time and investment. This problem and other salient ones are what I vision Moonly to solve. It’s currently a prototype version. But with the current development metrics, I’m optimistic that it will be a handy NFT project companion, dishing out the best timely ideas to its users when it finally launches. Moonly not only recommends the best NFT project available on Solana but goes ahead to help you decide which one is worth minting at a particular time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#so-whats-moonly-and-how-does-it-work"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  So what’s Moonly, and how does it work?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s an NFT recommender built on the Solana NFT blockchain. Since engagement determines, to a great extent, the potential worth of an NFT project, Moonly uses data analysis and detailed visualizations to give insights on metrics, such as the engagement pattern of NFT projects on Solana. Using these stats, it then tells you the most promising upcoming project with high potential to bring you passive income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recommender relies heavily on several NFT data points sourced from several APIs. And we also scrape some using &lt;a href="https://automatio.co"&gt;**Automatio&lt;/a&gt;** in real-time. This is also a way to interlink my products and build a robust infrastructural framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Moonly will recognize possible blue-chip NFT projects by analyzing over 18 different factors like social stats, engagement, validation of followers, growth rate, doxxed founders, roadmap, Discord community, etc. It will offer a set of tools to help you monitor existing NFT projects and better decide on trading factors like Floor Price, Volume, Listing count, historical data, undercut opportunities, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, regardless of your experience with NFTs, the purpose of Moonly is to take you to the moon! It ensures that you invest only in solid NFT projects with high ROI (return on investment) potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having been a part of the Solana community for a while now, it became my first choice for blockchain technology. Indeed, it’s one of the fastest decentralized systems. It also offers a lower cost per transaction, and it’s more eco-friendly than most alternatives out there. Plus, it’s a friendly community. That’s why it’s popular among NFT creators and investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below, you can find the top 30 Solana NFT projects of all time, sorted by volume. Clicking on any of them redirects you to Moonly, where you can find more information about them. Nonetheless, note that what you currently see is just a prototype. A fully rebuilt version is coming soon, with more data for each project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peace.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/manuthecoder/hey-did-you-know-devto-has-an-api-3api</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wanted to embed a "Recent Posts" in your website? DEV.to has an API for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out this example: &lt;a href="https://manuthecoder.ml"&gt;https://manuthecoder.ml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just make a simple HTTP request to this URL:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;https://dev.to/api/articles?username=____YOUR_USERNAME_HERE____&amp;amp;per_page=5
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Example JS usage:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;https://dev.to/api/articles?username=manuthecoder&amp;amp;per_page=10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;article&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerHTML&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;article&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;article&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;classList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;screw IE. nobody uses it lol&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Gitlab CI/CD + NodeJs + pm2</title>
      <author>Suman Sarkar</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 16:16:59 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/sumansarkar/gitlab-cicd-nodejs-pm2-4llh</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/sumansarkar/gitlab-cicd-nodejs-pm2-4llh</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;✋ Hi this is Suman Sarkar, a web-dev from Kolkata with 5 years of experience in programming and little to none experience with CI/CD. Today I'll talk about how to setup Gitlab CI/CD with self hosted runners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pointright-things-we-will-cover-in-this-article"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  👉 Things we will cover in this article
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;😕 What is CI/CD?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;👍 Setup a minimal expressjs API with pm2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🧑‍💻 Setup our first ever Gitlab pipeline to install &amp;amp; restart our server whenever an update is pushed on the “dev” branch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🏃 Install self-hosted runners on a linux server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🔒 Register our local runner to Gitlab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🔑 Add environment variables to Gitlab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#confused-what-is-cicd"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  😕 What is CI/CD?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my perspective CI/CD or Continuous Integration &amp;amp; Continuous Deployment are processes that you set up for your own convenience so that you don't have to do boring things manually over and over, it is basically automating your workflow when you push an update to your project. Most of us do git pull and then sort of restart the server in order to make the changes into effect, there might be additional steps like building or testing and few other procedures that are specific to your project. I’ll not cover these today, today I’ll only cover how to setup CI/CD for an expressjs application with pm2, Gitlab pipeline and self-hosted runners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#thumbsup-setup-a-minimal-expressjs-api-with-pm2"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  👍 Setup a minimal expressjs API with pm2
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We start with creating a directory for our Node JS Express API&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;mkdir &lt;/span&gt;node-cicd-pm2
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;node-cicd-pm2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then we initialise our project with &lt;code&gt;npm init -y&lt;/code&gt;. This creates a &lt;strong&gt;package.json&lt;/strong&gt; file in our project folder with basic information for our project.&lt;br&gt;
Next we add our dependencies by running&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm i –save express dotenv
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lets create our very minimal server by creating our &lt;code&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt; and pasting the below mentioned code.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dotenv&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;dotenv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dotenv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;send&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Hello World!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;PORT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Server is running on port http://localhost:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;PORT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here, we have required our dependencies express and dotenv then we have added a route that returns 'Hello World!'. We have also added a &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file with only 1 variable.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;PORT="3001"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;and &lt;code&gt;ecosystem.config.js&lt;/code&gt; file with the following content&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;module.exports = {
    apps: [{
        name: "node-cicd-pm2",
        script: "./index.js"
    }]
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This will be used later to start our server as a process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we start our server by running &lt;code&gt;node index.js&lt;/code&gt; and visit &lt;a href="http://localhost:3001/"&gt;http://localhost:3001/&lt;/a&gt;. It works on my machine! 😈&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IpmAOAM2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/544hed6gwezrqpsrjv5i.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IpmAOAM2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/544hed6gwezrqpsrjv5i.png" alt="Gitlab CI/CD + NodeJs + pm2" width="496" height="208"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#runner-setup-our-first-ever-gitlab-pipeline"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🏃 Setup our first ever Gitlab pipeline
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We start with creating a file specifically named &lt;code&gt;.gitlab-ci.yml&lt;/code&gt;. This is an YML file, if you don't like YML, bad news for you, but you can just copy paste and get things done. &lt;br&gt;
Now, paste the following code. I'll explain this in detail.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;stages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;build_stage&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;deploy_stage&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lets talk about stages, stage are the necessary steps that you can group and describe. We have 2 stages build_stage and deploy_stage. Though we are not building anything here but I like to call it the build stage where we'll install the dependencies. We will cover the deploy stage later.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;.base-rules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;rules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"dev"'&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;when&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;always&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"push"'&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;when&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;never&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;$CI_COMMIT_TAG&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;when&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;never&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rules are to describe exactly when your pipeline should run. Here we are specifying that we want to run our pipeline whenever something is pushed onto dev branch by specifying &lt;strong&gt;when&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;always&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE&lt;/strong&gt; is a special(pre-defined) env. variable provided by Gitlab. It describes the mode our change. These can be the following values push, web, schedule, api, external, chat, webide, merge_request_event, external_pull_request_event, parent_pipeline, trigger, or pipeline. For the same of this article I'll not cover all of them, I am not familiar with most of them anyway.&lt;br&gt;
You can read more about the variables &lt;a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/predefined_variables.html"&gt;here on Gitlab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up we have caches. The way every stage works is, it cleans or deletes everything a it has produce during its lifetime. In the build stage we will create a &lt;strong&gt;node_modules&lt;/strong&gt; folder which will contain our project's dependencies. When the &lt;strong&gt;build_stage&lt;/strong&gt; is finished we don't want it to be deleted. We want it to passed to the &lt;strong&gt;deploy_stage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;cache&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;&amp;amp;global_cache&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;policy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;pull-push&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;paths&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;node_modules/&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;package-lock.json&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We have created a global cache policy here. The policy is pull-push meaning that the stages using this cache policy can pull from global cache and can push to it as well. In order to create new caches with every update, we must provide a slug or an unique identifier. Here we are using &lt;strong&gt;$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG&lt;/strong&gt; variable for that. Notice how we are specifying that we only want to cache &lt;code&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; directory and &lt;code&gt;package-lock.json&lt;/code&gt; since these are the outputs that are generate with &lt;code&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's now define our &lt;strong&gt;build_stage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;stage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;build_stage&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;.base-rules&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;npm i&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;cache&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;*global_cache&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;policy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;tags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;local_runner&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The build_stage extends the base_rule so that it will run only when something is pushed on the &lt;code&gt;dev&lt;/code&gt; branch.&lt;br&gt;
In this stage we don't want to pull anything from the global-cache, we just want to push the &lt;code&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; directory and &lt;code&gt;package-lock.json&lt;/code&gt; file in the global-cache. We will cover &lt;strong&gt;tags&lt;/strong&gt; later int this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later we have the &lt;strong&gt;deploy_stage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;deploy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;stage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;deploy_stage&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;.base-rules&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;pm2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;ecosystem.config.js"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;cache&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;*global_cache&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;policy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;pull&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;tags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;local_runner&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this stage we are pulling the cache from global-cache and then starting our server with &lt;code&gt;pm2 start&lt;/code&gt; command. By pulling the cache we get our &lt;code&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; directory with our project dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have followed correctly, you should end up with a file with these content&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;stages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;build_stage&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;deploy_stage&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="na"&gt;.base-rules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;rules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"dev"'&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;when&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;always&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"push"'&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;when&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;never&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;$CI_COMMIT_TAG&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;when&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;never&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="na"&gt;cache&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;&amp;amp;global_cache&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;policy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;pull-push&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;paths&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;node_modules/&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;package-lock.json&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="na"&gt;build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;stage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;build_stage&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;.base-rules&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;--version"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;npm i&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;cache&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;*global_cache&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;policy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;tags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;local_runner&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="na"&gt;deploy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;stage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;deploy_stage&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;.base-rules&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;pm2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;ecosystem.config.js"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;cache&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;*global_cache&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;policy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;pull&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;tags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;local_runner&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#computer-install-selfhosted-runners-on-a-linux-server"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  💻 Install self-hosted runners on a linux server
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little bit of background on runners, runners are like workers who does something that a computer should do. Like executing any commands or installing your project dependencies. Behind the scene they are docker containers provided by Gitlab. By default Gitlab uses a Ruby container but you can specify your container type. In this article though we will not use Gitlab's runners, we will install our own runner which is an open-source application made by Gitlab and maintained by the dev community. Self hosted runners are completely free so you don't have to worry about money 🤑.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installing the runner on your server is easy, you just have to run few commands. Visit this &lt;a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/"&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; for instruction related to your OS environment. I'm running Ubuntu 20.10 so I'll follow with GNU/Linux Binary guide.. If you are using any debian machine then follow me.. Fire up your terminal and run the following commands..&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;curl &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-L&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--output&lt;/span&gt; /usr/local/bin/gitlab-runner &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"https://gitlab-runner-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/latest/binaries/gitlab-runner-linux-amd64"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo chmod&lt;/span&gt; +x /usr/local/bin/gitlab-runner
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;useradd &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--comment&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'GitLab Runner'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--create-home&lt;/span&gt; gitlab-runner &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--shell&lt;/span&gt; /bin/bash
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;gitlab-runner &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;gitlab-runner &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--working-directory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;/home/gitlab-runner
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;gitlab-runner start
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;gitlab-runner status

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Step by step we get the binary, give it executable permissions, create a user called &lt;strong&gt;gitlab-runner&lt;/strong&gt; to run the runners process and then start our gitlab-runner service. The gitlab-runner user is created for security purpose so that it doesn't run as root user. It is generally advised by people who are smarter than me and have was more knowledge about operating systems 😅.&lt;br&gt;
Now, after the last command you should see something like this&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ALFS_H_L--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/47x27khsncbgu1cjqb3v.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ALFS_H_L--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/47x27khsncbgu1cjqb3v.png" alt="Gitlab CI/CD + NodeJs + pm2 - Gitlab runner service is running" width="880" height="68"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Again, it worked on my machine so I'm good! 😅. We are not done with this step though.. We have to login as the &lt;strong&gt;gitlab-runner&lt;/strong&gt; user and install node,  npm and pm2. I could not find any reference to what is the default password of gitlab-runner user so I will just reset it using the passwd command.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;passwd gitlab-runner
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Setup your new password and login as the gitlab-runner user by running &lt;code&gt;su gitlab-runner&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For install node I'm using &lt;strong&gt;nvm&lt;/strong&gt;. Just follow the same process mentioned below and you should have everything you need.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/master/install.sh | bash
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; ~/.bashrc
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;this should install nvm in you machine.&lt;br&gt;
Next, we install node and pm2 globally,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;nvm install 16.13.2
npm i -g pm2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lock-register-our-local-runner-to-gitlab"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🔒 Register our local runner to Gitlab
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are almost done with our setup..&lt;br&gt;
Now, we need to register our runner to Gitlab, to do this go to Setting &amp;gt; CI/CD in your repository and expand the "Runners" section.&lt;br&gt;
At the left side you should see "Specific runners" section.&lt;br&gt;
The token should look something like this "fy7f3BqhVzLq3Mr-xxxx"&lt;br&gt;
In your local machine or wherever you have installed you runner just run&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo gitlab-runner register
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This should prompt you to specify an instance URL. Type &lt;code&gt;https://gitlab.com&lt;/code&gt; and press enter.&lt;br&gt;
Then paste the registration token that you found on Gitlab and press enter, next provide a description for your runner&lt;br&gt;
the most important step, providing a tag for your runner or tags. In the &lt;code&gt;.gitlab-ci.yml&lt;/code&gt; file I had mention the tags as &lt;strong&gt;local_runner&lt;/strong&gt; so I will put that here. You can add multiple tags separated by comma but that's not mandatory. Tags will identify the runners to do their job. At last choose &lt;strong&gt;shell&lt;/strong&gt; as the executor. The End? Not yet! :'(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#key-add-environment-variables-to-gitlab"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🔑 Add environment variables to Gitlab
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we need to add env variable to Gitlab CI/CD section so that the we can provide a &lt;strong&gt;PORT&lt;/strong&gt; to our application. This is important because .env file is not commited to your version control. We add our env variable PORT under Setting &amp;gt; CI/CD &amp;gt; Variables section and we add the variable as protected. Next, super important - we need to make our dev branch as protected branch. Otherwise it won't fine the variables. You can do this from Settings &amp;gt; Repository &amp;gt; Protected branches section in your repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;✅ That is it, we are done with our pipeline setup. If everything is done correctly, when you commit a change on your dev branch it should trigger a pipeline with 2 job and you runner should start the pm2 process at 3001 port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading this article 🧑‍💻 If you face any problems, let me know in the comments down below! 🙂 &lt;br&gt;
Happy hacking!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FVCI_wXj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1ry5q0kaegljb70hs745.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FVCI_wXj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1ry5q0kaegljb70hs745.png" alt="Banner Image" width="880" height="293"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021 saw a major boom in web3 education and developer content. There a plethora of excellent tutorials available online that teach you everything you need to get started in web3, from building simple &lt;a href="https://docs.alchemy.com/tutorials/hello-world-smart-contract"&gt;Hello World contracts&lt;/a&gt; to creating full-fledged &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@austin_48503/%EF%B8%8F-minimum-viable-exchange-d84f30bd0c90"&gt;decentralized exchanges&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://dev.to/dabit3/building-scalable-full-stack-apps-on-ethereum-with-polygon-2cfb"&gt;NFT marketplaces&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, almost every tutorial (including the ones published by us) show you how to launch apps on testnets with fake money. There is extremely little coverage on how to launch on a mainnet, and the considerations and challenges involved with the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article, therefore, is on one of the most-requested topics on our &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/8UqJXTX7Kd"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;: how to develop and deploy a smart contract in the real world with real money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#disclaimer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Disclaimer
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We make the assumption that you are already familiar with developing smart contracts on EVM-compatible chains using tools like Solidity, Ethers, and Hardhat. If some of these terms sound alien to you, we strongly suggest going through &lt;a href="https://medium.com/scrappy-squirrels/tutorial-writing-an-nft-collectible-smart-contract-9c7e235e96da"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-1-developing-contract-on-testnet"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 1: Developing Contract on Testnet
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nxqtxTvb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h96fbsrplnxf01eaxyno.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nxqtxTvb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h96fbsrplnxf01eaxyno.png" alt="Mumbai" width="300" height="195"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step remains the same as with every other tutorial. You develop and test your contract on a testnet of the blockchain (or sidechain) that you wish to launch on. For example, you would use Rinkeby or Ropsten if your network of choice was Ethereum and Mumbai if you preferred Polygon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most testnets do a very good job of mimicking their corresponding mainnet and also provide free fake tokens to work with through faucets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can reasonably expect your contract’s behaviour on a testnet to be almost identical to that on the mainnet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-2-auditing-and-optimizing-contract"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 2: Auditing and Optimizing Contract
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--B7PhA0Tt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/er6vhaovsgerzc9x8oqz.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--B7PhA0Tt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/er6vhaovsgerzc9x8oqz.png" alt="Solidity Finance" width="880" height="471"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deploying a contract on a testnet costs the same amount of gas as deploying to a mainnet (note that I’m referring to gas units and not gas price).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Checking how much gas contract deployment consumes should give you a good early indication of how expensive deployment is going to be. In some cases, it may be possible to significantly reduce gas consumption (for example, using an ERC-1155 implementation in place of ERC-721 for an NFT dapp).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do take the time out to evaluate your choices and ensure that reduction of gas consumption does not come at the expense of security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’re satisfied with the final version of the contract, you should get it audited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are excellent services like &lt;a href="https://solidity.finance/"&gt;solidity.finance&lt;/a&gt; that will audit your contract for a fee. Do note that the fee may be steep for a lot of projects. But if your dapp is going to be handling assets of other people worth millions of dollars, then I believe that an audit is mandatory and definitely worth the price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if your project is of a significantly smaller scale (for example, a generative NFT project), then a professional audit may be overkill. In such cases, just ensure that the contract has been tested and walked through by at least two smart contract developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-3-estimating-cost-of-deployment"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 3: Estimating Cost of Deployment
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--c3gqoISz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jvoq9r3sa6npf8m8064d.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--c3gqoISz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jvoq9r3sa6npf8m8064d.png" alt="Gas" width="299" height="168"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’re satisfied with the way your dapp behaves and are convinced that there are no glaring security loopholes, you can proceed to computing the total cost of deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, the amount of gas consumed across testnets and the mainnet is the same. To arrive at an estimate of deployment cost on a mainnet, all you need to do is multiply gas consumed with the gas price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, deployments on Ethereum cost thousands of dollars whereas deployment to sidechains like Polygon and Binance can be done in under five dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a detailed tutorial on how to estimate costs and consider your chain options &lt;a href="https://medium.com/scrappy-squirrels/estimating-smart-contract-costs-f65acf818c26?source=collection_home---6------6-----------------------"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-4-acquiring-tokens"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 4: Acquiring tokens
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jCBsJsaR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/a3k840dqny4njvg7x98a.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jCBsJsaR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/a3k840dqny4njvg7x98a.png" alt="Moonpay" width="880" height="460"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This step may seem way too obvious to warrant an entire section but we have seen a few of our community members trip up in this step, especially when working with sidechains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that you need to acquire a particular token in the chain that you’re working with. This means you need ETH on the Ethereum Mainnet, MATIC on the Polygon network, and BNB on the Binance Smart Chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to acquire these tokens on their respective chains is by using a ramp service like &lt;a href="https://www.moonpay.com/"&gt;Moonpay&lt;/a&gt; that allows you to purchase crypto using just a credit card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, these services don’t work in all countries (India, for example). In such cases, you will unfortunately have to deal with steps like buying on centralized exchanges, KYCs, and withdrawal to Metamask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During withdrawal, make sure that your tokens are being transferred to the correct network. By default, most exchanges will send your MATIC and BNB to the Ethereum network. &lt;strong&gt;They are useless there and bridging them to the correct network is complicated and expensive&lt;/strong&gt;. Make sure you only use exchanges that have a direct ramp to the network you want to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be releasing an article on the options you have while purchasing MATIC, BNB, FTM, and other sidechain cryptocurrencies soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-5-configuring-hardhat-and-alchemy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 5: Configuring Hardhat and Alchemy
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q-vjeXt6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qx1zd3kv7z38brvhsuft.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q-vjeXt6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qx1zd3kv7z38brvhsuft.png" alt="Hardhat" width="880" height="458"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is now time for deployment!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to deploy to a particular chain, we will need an RPC URL. We’ve already discussed how to acquire this using &lt;a href="https://alchemy.com/?a=d7d81950c0"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="https://medium.com/scrappy-squirrels/tutorial-writing-an-nft-collectible-smart-contract-9c7e235e96da"&gt;Rinkeby&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://medium.com/scrappy-squirrels/tutorial-developing-for-polygon-and-sidechains-66bef9ec80ef"&gt;Polygon Mumbai&lt;/a&gt; testnets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the corresponding mainnets, the process is identical: create an Alchemy app, set the network to the chain of your choice, and copy the HTTP RPC URL. Below is an app created for the Ethereum mainnet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FnfEXp6u--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vkajlaa2xqzup34nor1n.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FnfEXp6u--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vkajlaa2xqzup34nor1n.png" alt="Alchemy App" width="800" height="409"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do note that Alchemy, at the time of writing, does not provide RPC URLs for every chain that you could potentially want to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For chains not supported by Alchemy (for example, Fantom Opera), you can use the public RPC URLs available. For instance, &lt;a href="https://rpc.ftm.tools/"&gt;https://rpc.ftm.tools/&lt;/a&gt; for Fantom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now have everything to configure &lt;code&gt;hardhat.config.js&lt;/code&gt;. Add the mainnet network of your choice to &lt;code&gt;module.exports&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;module.exports = {  
    solidity: "0.8.4",  
    networks: {    
        rinkeby: {      
            url: RINKEBY_RPC_URL,      
            accounts: [`0x${PRIVATE_KEY}`],   
        },
        mainnet: {      
            url: ETHEREUM_RPC_URL,      
            accounts: [`0x${PRIVATE_KEY}`],   
        },
        polygon: {      
            url: POLYGON_RPC_URL,      
            accounts: [`0x${PRIVATE_KEY}`],   
        },          
    }
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As is good practice, we have defined our RPC URLs and our wallet’s private key in a &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file that will not be committed to our git repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, running&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mainnet
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Will deploy your contract to the Ethereum mainnet. Similarly, running&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network polygon
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Will deploy your contract to the Polygon mainnet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setting-gas-price"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setting Gas Price
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do note that if you deploy your contract using our &lt;code&gt;deploy.js&lt;/code&gt; script from the previous tutorials, ethers will automatically set a gas price and deploy using that price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In testnets and sidechains like Polygon and Binance, this may not really be an issue. However, lower gas fees could result in savings worth thousands of dollars on Ethereum. Which is why it is prudent to set a gas price yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is very easy to with ethers. In &lt;code&gt;deploy.js&lt;/code&gt;, add an argument to the &lt;code&gt;deploy()&lt;/code&gt; method to set a gas price as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const factory = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory('MyContract');    
const contract = await factory.deploy(arg1, 
                                      arg2, 
                                      {gasPrice:50000000000});    
await contract.deployed();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you can probably deduce, we have deployed this contract by setting a gas fee of 50 Gwei.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#optional-deploying-using-metamask-amp-remix"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  (Optional) Deploying using Metamask &amp;amp; Remix
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yNqqz_hY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gi2ihgpzlfb1k1zn3880.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yNqqz_hY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gi2ihgpzlfb1k1zn3880.png" alt="Remix" width="880" height="264"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you deploy using hardhat, it automatically drains your wallet of the funds that it needs to perform the request. In other words, there is no confirmation step in between. You issue a command to run the deployment script and boom! your funds are gone and your contract is deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is somewhat anxiety-inducing to you, you can consider using &lt;a href="https://remix.ethereum.org/"&gt;Remix&lt;/a&gt; as a viable alternative. Remix is world class IDE for developing and deploying contracts on Ethereum and EVM-based chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remix allows you to deploy your contracts using Metamask. By doing so, it places an important confirmation step in between where you can evaluate and approve the total amount you’re spending, and modify gas fees using Metamask’s interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also have the option of getting popup notifications from Metamask as and when your transaction is complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be doing a tutorial on Remix very soon. There are plenty of great tutorials online that use Remix by default though so you shouldn’t find it too hard to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope this article has given you a good idea on the things you need to consider before you take the big step of launching your dapp to a mainnet and have real people use real money on it.&lt;/p&gt;

  Secret settings to improve the experience
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain settings are turned off by default but are worth turning on and make life a lot easier. Open your vs code,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to change the settings in vs code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JSON Way &lt;em&gt;(the preferred and easy way)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GUI Way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-json-way"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The JSON way
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open &lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette"&gt;VS Code Command Pallet&lt;/a&gt; using the keyboard shortcut &lt;code&gt;Ctrl+Shift+P&lt;/code&gt; on Windows or &lt;code&gt;Cmd+Shift+P&lt;/code&gt; on Mac or hit &lt;code&gt;F1&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type &lt;em&gt;settings JSON&lt;/em&gt; in command pallet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open  &lt;em&gt;'Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)'&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now copy the following lines to your &lt;code&gt;settings.json&lt;/code&gt; file
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"files.autoSave"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"afterDelay"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"files.trimTrailingWhitespace"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"editor.wordWrap"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"on"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"editor.formatOnSave"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"editor.wordWrapColumn"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;120&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"editor.formatOnPaste"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"editor.quickSuggestions"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"editor.inlineSuggest.enabled"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"editor.codeActionsOnSave"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"source.fixAll"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"source.organizeImports"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"editor.wordWrap"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"on"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"editor.defaultFormatter"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"esbenp.prettier-vscode"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;Extensions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;settings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"git.autofetch"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"git.allowForcePush"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"git.autorefresh"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"git.autoRepositoryDetection"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"javascript.updateImportsOnFileMove.enabled"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"always"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"typescript.updateImportsOnFileMove.enabled"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"always"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"tabnine.experimentalAutoImports"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"prettier.singleQuote"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"prettier.endOfLine"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"crlf"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"prettier.jsxBracketSameLine"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"prettier.printWidth"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;120&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"eslint.validate"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"typescript"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"javascript"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"typescriptreact"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"javascriptreact"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"better-comments.highlightPlainText"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#gui-way"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  GUI Way
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, open the settings page&lt;br&gt;
hit &lt;code&gt;Ctrl+,&lt;/code&gt; on windows or &lt;code&gt;Cmd+,&lt;/code&gt; on mac to open the settings page or go to &lt;em&gt;File&amp;gt;Prefrences&amp;gt;Settings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Now suppose for eg, you want to turn on the word wrap the entry in &lt;code&gt;settings.json&lt;/code&gt; is:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"editor.wordWrap"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"on"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;so in the search bar enter &lt;code&gt;editor.wordWrap&lt;/code&gt; and change the setting accordingly. This is the reason I prefer JSON way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#editors-makeover"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Editor's Makeover
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's time to change the editor's look and feel, I will walk you through some steps and you will love the way your editor looks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#theme"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Theme
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start by changing the theme of your editor. There are numerous themes available in the marketplace. I have listed some of my favorites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To change your theme:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install the one you like&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now to select it hit &lt;code&gt;Ctrl+K+T&lt;/code&gt; on windows and &lt;code&gt;Cmd+K+T&lt;/code&gt; on mac and select your theme or &lt;em&gt;click on the gear icon on the bottom left&amp;gt;Color Theme&amp;gt;Select the theme&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Themes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BeardedBear.beardedtheme"&gt;Bearded Theme&lt;/a&gt;: There are 25 variations of this theme I have listed two of my favorite

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Black &amp;amp; Amethyst
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sE7J_fFF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/98jy91p7zeqgtsihcb31.png" alt="Bearded Theme Black &amp;amp; Amethyst Example" width="880" height="495"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anthracite

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wesbos.theme-cobalt2"&gt;Cobolt2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9vZVPWwH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wesbos/cobalt2-vscode/cobalt2-updates/images/ss.png" alt="Official Cobolt2 Theme Example" width="880" height="626"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme"&gt;Github Dark Theme&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SNDqX8l9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n2t99ff36bu3x8ftcxba.png" alt="Github Dark Theme Example" width="880" height="495"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=enkia.tokyo-night"&gt;Tokyo Night&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Ri3mveMa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enkia/tokyo-night-vscode-theme/master/static/ss_tokyo_night.png" alt="Official Tokyo Night Theme Example" width="880" height="613"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#icons"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Icons
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two types of icons in vs code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File Icons: You see beside your files and folders, I prefer &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme"&gt;Material Icon Theme&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Product Icons: You see all around the vs code, I prefer &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=miguelsolorio.fluent-icons"&gt;Fluent Icons&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dl19moV0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/s3u47o1z3zxvznlrsaz0.png" alt="Material Icon Theme Example" width="880" height="495"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To change the icons theme:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click on the gear icon on the bottom left&amp;gt;File Icon Theme/Product Icon Theme&amp;gt;Select the theme&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also set the theme and icon theme from the &lt;code&gt;settings.json&lt;/code&gt; file just add these lines&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"workbench.colorTheme"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Bearded Theme Black &amp;amp; Amethyst"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;your&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"workbench.iconTheme"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"material-icon-theme"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"workbench.productIconTheme"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"fluent-icons"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"material-icon-theme.folders.color"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"#42a5f5"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"material-icon-theme.folders.theme"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"specific"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#font"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Font
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the font I love &lt;a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Code"&gt;Fira Code&lt;/a&gt;, which also supports font legislature.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ywO8062d--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/raw/master/extras/logo.svg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ywO8062d--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/raw/master/extras/logo.svg" alt="Official Fira Code Font Legislature Example Image" width="880" height="503"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noticed those symbols, these are called legislature, believe me, this adds a star when someone looks into your editor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add these lines to your &lt;code&gt;settings.json&lt;/code&gt; for the font configuration&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"editor.fontSize"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"editor.lineHeight"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"editor.letterSpacing"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"editor.fontLigatures"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"editor.fontFamily"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Fira Code, Operator Mono, Consolas, 'Courier New', monospace"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And for the final touch-ups add these&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"editor.cursorBlinking"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"expand"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"editor.cursorSmoothCaretAnimation"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
