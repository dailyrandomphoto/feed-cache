      <guid>https://dev.to/siddhantkhisty/roadmap-to-becoming-a-developer-and-getting-known-24o4</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There can be a lot of doubts for a person who wants to get into development on how to start. This blog is made to clear some of those doubts. &lt;br&gt;
So first and foremost, what is development?&lt;br&gt;
It's the art of creating something. It can be anything that you create. It could be a website, a game, an app or a service.&lt;br&gt;
There are a few basic steps that every developer has to follow in order to start their journey. Here are the steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-pick-a-language"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Pick a language:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--R_zpuwVB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://miro.medium.com/max/1838/1%2AHLGtY6O2vUHqIyEbWdmBgA.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--R_zpuwVB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://miro.medium.com/max/1838/1%2AHLGtY6O2vUHqIyEbWdmBgA.jpeg" alt="Languages"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may seem obvious, but selecting your first language is the very first step to your developer journey. You can select whichever language you want weather it be Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, Go, etc. My reccomendation would be to pick Java as your first language. You can switch to other languages too after you have learned the basics. I say Java because it is the most used language in large industries. Learning Java is also easier compared to learning C++ as C++ has the concept of pointers and memory management whereas Java has dynamic memory management i.e you do not have to manually allocate the memory. It is done automatically. If you are still contemplating which language to choose, remember this one quote, "First analiyze the problem, then select the appropriate technology to solve that problem". If you ask me to elaborate on this then in simple words, you cannot drill a hole in the wall with a screwdriver, you will need a drilling machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-learn-data-structures-and-algorithms"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Learn Data Structures and Algorithms:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uaEY6FW2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AO0dFdQ5--/c_imagga_scale%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_900%2Cq_auto%2Cw_1600/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/srnvrd7vfeeq5qpxnabq.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uaEY6FW2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AO0dFdQ5--/c_imagga_scale%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_900%2Cq_auto%2Cw_1600/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/srnvrd7vfeeq5qpxnabq.png" alt="Data Structres and Algorithms"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are the basics in learning any type of development. They are useful in developing various applications. DSA is also asked in interviews for Software roles, hecne it is really important to get a really good grasp on the basic concepts. After you learn the basics of any language you should move on to learning the data structures and algorithms. You can select any language for this as DSA is langauge exclusive i.e It is the same in all languages. If you want a DSA course, there is a free course on youtube by &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9gnSGHSqcnr_DxHsP7AW9ftq0AtAyYqJ"&gt;Kunal Kushwaha&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-learn-development"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Learn Development.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saying "Learn Development" can be a bit ambigious so I am going to break it down into a easier to understand format. The first thing you need to know is that there are many fields of development. I will list some of them below with a brief description -&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web Development&lt;/strong&gt; :&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0mP_mpNj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://image.shutterstock.com/image-vector/web-development-chart-keywords-icons-260nw-394793860.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0mP_mpNj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://image.shutterstock.com/image-vector/web-development-chart-keywords-icons-260nw-394793860.jpg" alt="Web Dev"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Web Development is just making a website. Now you may know that there are tools such as WordPress or Wix which can be used for creating a website. However, if you hardcode your website, you get a lot more development flexibility. The most basic technology used in web development is HTML, CSS and JavaScript. A great place to learn web development is &lt;a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/"&gt;Free Code Camp&lt;/a&gt; There are more aspects to web development as well, they are -&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Front End&lt;/strong&gt; : This refers to everything the user sees. The page layout, UI is what is considered the front end of a website. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Back End&lt;/strong&gt;: This refers to everything that happens behind the scenes of the website. Sending requests to the server, receiving packets, sending data, the process of Loggin in, etc is all included in back end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;DataBase&lt;/strong&gt; : Database is where all of the user data is stored. User data can be the bio you write, or your loggin credentials (They are obivously encrypted when stored).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;FullStack&lt;/strong&gt; : Fullstack is basically a developer who knows about all the above 3 mentioned aspects. A fullstack developer handles the frontend, backend and the database too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;App Development&lt;/strong&gt; :&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4JIWoEWm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.mobileaction.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/type-mobile-apps-1024x690.jpg%3Fx38980" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4JIWoEWm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.mobileaction.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/type-mobile-apps-1024x690.jpg%3Fx38980" alt="App Dev"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; App Development, also known as mobile development is developing apps for phones. Android and IOS development both are included in this. However it is important to know that the technologies used for Android and IOS are diffrent. IOS primarly uses Swift where as Android can use Kotlin or Flutter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud Development&lt;/strong&gt; :&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NMmrKcP---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.emphatictechnologies.com/images/Cloud%2520Computing.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NMmrKcP---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.emphatictechnologies.com/images/Cloud%2520Computing.png" alt="Cloud"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Cloud is basically a computer somewhere in the internet. You can connect to this computer and store your files or use the processing power of this computer to run your applications. Cloud Development refers to using tools such as Azure or AWS or Google Cloud to manupilate this space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine Learning/Artifical Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; :&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Pv_hH61p--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.qubole.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1-400x387.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Pv_hH61p--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.qubole.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1-400x387.png" alt="Ai/ML"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Artifical Intelligence is just as it sounds. Teaching the computer how to think. Machine Learning is giving the computer many taste cases and train it on a certain pattern. There are varrying levels of AI you can see everywhere. Alexa, Siri and Cortana are good examples of Artifical Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DevOps&lt;/strong&gt; :&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LCb1H7hn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://intland.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/devops-infinity-1-1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LCb1H7hn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://intland.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/devops-infinity-1-1.png" alt="DevOps Cycle"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; DevOps is not exactly a type of development. Rather it is a way of working. It combines two departments i.e Development (The team that develops the software) and Operations (The Team that monitors the deployment and stabilty of the software). DevOps is a method incorperated in order to avoid app crashes. There is continous testing in every phase. For more information on DevOps, there is a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhc-GEHI0F7_8mbj23YWFpsgu1fl1yGL_"&gt;DevOps Bootcamp&lt;/a&gt; by Civo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Game Development&lt;/strong&gt; :&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ATFiictO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://image.shutterstock.com/image-photo/creative-male-game-developer-works-260nw-718743151.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ATFiictO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://image.shutterstock.com/image-photo/creative-male-game-developer-works-260nw-718743151.jpg" alt="Game Dev"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Game development is just as it sounds. Creating video games. However it is more than that. It is also used to create simulations or real life models. Game Development has a lot of aspects in it such as design, graphics, art, sound, animations, etc. Other types of development such as AI also plays a part in Game Development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-start-applying-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Start Applying :
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have learn a development skill, it is time to start applying your new knowledge in some projects. It is also important to know that you do not have to know the development field 100% in order to create something. Even if you know only 30% to 40% of the tech stack, you can still apply your skill. Some ways of applying your knowledge are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Source&lt;/strong&gt; :&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--68L-4jDc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.intuit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/open-source-software.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--68L-4jDc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.intuit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/open-source-software.png" alt="Open Source"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Open Source is a great way to apply your skills, level up your skills, interact with a community, and network with people. Open Source will also open a lot of doors for you if you are doing good work in the community. In order to contribute to open source you require to know &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apGV9Kg7ics&amp;amp;t=1602s"&gt;Git and Github&lt;/a&gt;. Git and Github is already needed in large scale development. Open Source also can give you a lot of experience of how the development cycle is in larger companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making Personal Projects&lt;/strong&gt; :&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zit052NO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://s3.amazonaws.com/www-inside-design/uploads/2019/05/portfoliofeature.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zit052NO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://s3.amazonaws.com/www-inside-design/uploads/2019/05/portfoliofeature.png" alt="Portfolio"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; You can even create your own personal projects. An example with web development is that you create your own Portfolio website. You can also create templates for various websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-networking-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Networking :&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9gYOHj_x--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://insights.dice.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/shutterstock_738913864.jpg" alt="Network"&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting known in the Community is a great step not only for getting opportunites but even to get mentors and meet great people. I advice you to make a twitter account and share about all your learnings and all the good work you do. You can also join various communities which will also help you in finding great people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is the end of this blog. I hope you found this helpful and good luck on your developer journey.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/gr7e/7-amazing-tips-while-redesigning-your-website-11b7</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Redesigning a website may be a stressful, time-consuming, and complex task. It’s natural if the amount of information you need to know in order to build a new, fresh design repulses you. However, if you take the time to educate yourself and gain hands-on experience, you can avoid making mistakes and achieve your goals. Here are seven golden pointers for redesigning your website to get you started:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you consider rebuilding your website, you most likely imagine something huge and powerful. It’s the ideal opportunity to give your website a bold and dramatic new appearance. However, the world is not what you might assume. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to integrate Google Analytics with a Next.js app</title>
      <author>bishal</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 01:51:45 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/biiishal/how-to-integrate-google-analytics-with-a-next-js-app-41hm</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/biiishal/how-to-integrate-google-analytics-with-a-next-js-app-41hm</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Chuck tag and script into &lt;a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/script"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Script&lt;/code&gt; tag&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;code&gt;_app.tsx&lt;/code&gt; file. Also, note &lt;strong&gt;to not include&lt;/strong&gt; the script tag inside the &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;_document.tsx&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting up analytics in a single-page application can be a PITA, specially if there is bunch of stuff going on under the hood when you use an opinionated framework like Next.js, eg. SSR, ISR etc. In this post we’ll be looking specifically into Next.js 11 and up, which has made lives much easier, and setting up GA4 with it's Global site tag aka &lt;code&gt;gtag.js&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing first, if you don't already have a Google Analytics 4 property setup, check out the &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9304153" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;official walkthrough&lt;/a&gt;, and set up default streams, at least the &lt;code&gt;Page views&lt;/code&gt; stream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might look something like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pY_laY8I--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://bish.al/_next/image%3Furl%3D%252F_next%252Fstatic%252Fimage%252Fpublic%252Fassets%252Fblog%252Fhow-to-add-google-analytics-to-next-js-app%252Fga-metrics.093c1e30393d712f87e3ed1cf00afaf8.webp%26w%3D3840%26q%3D75" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pY_laY8I--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://bish.al/_next/image%3Furl%3D%252F_next%252Fstatic%252Fimage%252Fpublic%252Fassets%252Fblog%252Fhow-to-add-google-analytics-to-next-js-app%252Fga-metrics.093c1e30393d712f87e3ed1cf00afaf8.webp%26w%3D3840%26q%3D75" alt="GA4 metrics settings"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Cmx4k2k5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://bish.al/_next/image%3Furl%3D%252F_next%252Fstatic%252Fimage%252Fpublic%252Fassets%252Fblog%252Fhow-to-add-google-analytics-to-next-js-app%252Fgtag-instructions.09446af7b0ce375a0a9d8b7be1e0ed9a.webp%26w%3D3840%26q%3D75" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Cmx4k2k5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://bish.al/_next/image%3Furl%3D%252F_next%252Fstatic%252Fimage%252Fpublic%252Fassets%252Fblog%252Fhow-to-add-google-analytics-to-next-js-app%252Fgtag-instructions.09446af7b0ce375a0a9d8b7be1e0ed9a.webp%26w%3D3840%26q%3D75" alt="GA4 metrics setup instructions"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, we simply need to include the snippet provided by the GA into our Next app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we do that, we'll pass in the GA ID through &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file (which we'll pass in via Vercel's environment variable setting, if you're using Vercel for deployment).&lt;br&gt;
In the root folder, in your &lt;code&gt;.env.local&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;// .env.local
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;G-12XXXXXXXX
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In your &lt;code&gt;_app.tsx&lt;/code&gt;, paste the snippet.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

          `&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;pageProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Few important things to note here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; for enclosing inline scripts, so that Next.js knows what's where. Failing to do so, might result in undesirable results. I have noticed double reporting of &lt;code&gt;page_view&lt;/code&gt; events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're setting &lt;code&gt;strategy='lazyOnload'&lt;/code&gt; . It's recommended to use &lt;code&gt;afterInteractive&lt;/code&gt; for analytics in the official docs, which is also the default. But that might cause slight hindrance on page load speed, so we're opting to load analytics scripts after everything else in the page have finished loading. I haven't noticed any drawbacks with this option.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-do-we-verify-everything-is-working"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How do we verify everything is working?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basic intuition is to login to your analytics dashboard, and monitor the &lt;strong&gt;Realtime&lt;/strong&gt; tab under &lt;strong&gt;Report&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also make use of this &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-analytics-debugger/jnkmfdileelhofjcijamephohjechhna?hl=en" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;handy chrome extension&lt;/a&gt;, and make sure a &lt;strong&gt;single&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;page-view&lt;/code&gt; event is triggered on page load and page navigation (browser history state change).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--201Hf3bk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://bish.al/_next/image%3Furl%3D%252F_next%252Fstatic%252Fimage%252Fpublic%252Fassets%252Fblog%252Fhow-to-add-google-analytics-to-next-js-app%252Fanalytics-extension-console-log.ede40298d768e06b243a81dd1fe14660.webp%26w%3D3840%26q%3D75" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--201Hf3bk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://bish.al/_next/image%3Furl%3D%252F_next%252Fstatic%252Fimage%252Fpublic%252Fassets%252Fblog%252Fhow-to-add-google-analytics-to-next-js-app%252Fanalytics-extension-console-log.ede40298d768e06b243a81dd1fe14660.webp%26w%3D3840%26q%3D75" alt="Expected log from Google Analytics extension in the console"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it, happy tracking. Use it responsibly. 🎉&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ethical Hacking Roadmap - A Beginners Guide</title>

      <description>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is an Ethical Hacker?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ethical hacker is a computer network specialist who deals with the security posture of an organization. His job involves eliciting security flaws in the organization he is working for by testing all aspects of the system and its services for any sort of vulnerabilities. The key point to notice is that all this is done with the permission of the owners of the organization and without any malicious intent. An ethical hacker is also known as a white hat hacker and is the stark opposite of a black hat hacker, a.k.a crackers who hack with the sole purpose of bringing about some sort of disruption, or chaos from the vulnerabilities they find. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Single feature app idea</title>
      <author>𝙹𝚊𝚜𝚘𝚗 𝙻𝚎𝚘𝚠 👨🏻‍💻</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 23:32:51 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/jasonleowsg/single-feature-app-idea-4ip</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/jasonleowsg/single-feature-app-idea-4ip</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here's an idea for a side project: Take one painful, labourious, repetitive task on Photoshop/Indesign/Sketch/Final Cut Pro/any editing software for that matter, and make that into a product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like this nifty little remove.bg web app. I love it. Removing backgrounds can already be done in Photoshop for sure, but to do it well (especially removing background from hair), it does take some manual effort. And it’s a task that happens pretty often enough to feel quite repetitive, boring and simply an unproductive use of time after a while. Software automation is great for tasks of such nature - manual, labourious, simple-enough, repetitive, boring. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember reading somewhere that Invision was built to facilitate client feedback, to make screen prototypes more shareable so that it’s easy for anyone (even non-designers) to comment. Imagine the loss of productivity from endless emailing of pdfs back and forth, versioning the different files each time - clientwebsite-final-final-final.pdf. Again, Invision replaces one repetitive, labourious and painful task of communication ping-pong into a product. Same with Google Docs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea for a single feature app or software product sounds so simple, yet so difficult to practice because everyday routine and habit blinds us to opportunities like these. So this made me think: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What boring, painful and simple work tasks that we do repetitively and manually on a regular basis, can be replaced by automation/software?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s hear it!&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Follow my daily writings on &lt;a href="https://golifelog.com/goals/30"&gt;Lifelog&lt;/a&gt;, where I write about learning to code, goals, productivity, indie hacking and tech for good.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Digital Artwork 🤝 NFTs</title>
      <author>Vincent Baylon</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 23:27:08 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/vincentbaylon/digital-artwork-nfts-2c2e</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/vincentbaylon/digital-artwork-nfts-2c2e</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the month of August, &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/"&gt;OpenSea&lt;/a&gt; a marketplace for NFTs (Non-Fungible Token), recorded &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/opensea-trading-volume-breaches-3bn-133114338.html"&gt;$3bn&lt;/a&gt; in trading volume. With the boom of NFTs I wanted to get a better understanding of the ins and outs of what exactly are NFTs, specifically how they are used with digital artwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ySE9bI5V--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ycyb48qadrbygn81zaw8.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ySE9bI5V--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ycyb48qadrbygn81zaw8.gif" alt="NFT"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-an-nft"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is an NFT?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-fungible means unique, something that can't be replaced with something else. A dollar is fungible, if we swapped $1 bills, we would both still have a value of $1. Concert tickets with seat assignments on them are non-fungible. Nose-bleed seats don't have the same value as front-row seats. A non-fungible token is a token that shows the digital asset it's connected to is unique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#blockchain"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Blockchain
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This token is stored in a decentralized database called blockchains. Decentralized means it isn't controlled by one entity. Blockchains are exactly like their name. They are blocks of data chained together in chronological order. Once a block is stored on the chain, it is set in stone. This makes it very difficult to hack a blockchain. Also since blockchains are decentralized, anybody on the blockchain has access to the data. This means there are always many eyes making sure there are no irregularities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cryptocurrency"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cryptocurrency
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cryptocurrency is a digital currency. Crypto is built on blockchains. Instead of a centralized bank keeping track of transactions, every crypto transaction is recorded on the blockchain. This allows for transparency and more trust in the currency. NFT transactions are done with the crypto the blockchain uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#smart-contracts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Smart Contracts
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smart contracts are digital contracts stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. It is essentially a program on the blockchain that contains if/else statements that run when those conditions are met. For example, the transfer of an NFT from one owner to another. The smart contract will execute when payment is received. This adds to the safety of blockchains because there's no third party involved. The blockchain handles the transaction and the records of the transaction is stored on the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#digital-artwork"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Digital Artwork
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these mediums allow for digital artwork to have ownership. A common talking point from those questioning the crazy prices on some NFTs is, "I can just right-click and save". I can get a copy of the Mona Lisa but that doesn't mean I own the actual Mona Lisa. NFTs prove ownership of the digital artwork. And that is what drives the price up. We've seen the crazy prices paid for physical art pieces. I believe digital artwork paired with NFTs is the modern version of that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cool thing about digital artwork is artists have the ability to combine code with their artwork. &lt;a href="https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/"&gt;Bored Ape Yacht Club&lt;/a&gt;, a popular collection, recently had a release that mutated one of their collections into new art pieces when a &lt;em&gt;serum&lt;/em&gt; was applied to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--aIAGuOn8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qzdxg3wox60z9imrvb5n.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--aIAGuOn8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qzdxg3wox60z9imrvb5n.gif" alt="Mutant Serum"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this all hype or is this the new age of art ownership? Nobody knows but I believe the current system has a good foundation to build on. It's transparent and safe and could explain why people are trusting it for six even seven figure transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/salehmdev/setting-up-a-net-5-web-api-running-it-in-docker-for-beginners-2np9</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey there! 👋🏼&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, we'll be setting up a .NET 5 web API and running it locally, then we'll take a look at how to build and run it inside of a Docker container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To set up the project, we'll be using the dotnet CLI -- which is cross-platform and is included with .NET 5 SDK!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-web-api"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why web API?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The .NET team has provided multiple useful templates that can be used when creating a project. Whenever you choose one of them, they set up the project skeleton pre-made to include commonly used packages and folder structure (this is called &lt;em&gt;scaffolding&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're using the &lt;code&gt;webapi&lt;/code&gt; template to help scaffold our project. The web API template is a great starting point for building out a standard API because it sets you up with a common folder structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also doesn't bloat your project with any extra packages, other than &lt;code&gt;Swashbuckle.AspNetCore&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;a href="https://swagger.io/docs/specification/2-0/what-is-swagger/"&gt;Swagger&lt;/a&gt; support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll be using Swagger to see if our API is running locally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prerequisites"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Prerequisites
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0"&gt;.NET 5 SDK&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop"&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the .NET 5 SDK and Docker are installed, you should be able to use the CLI commands. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To check, you can run these:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;dotnet &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--version&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--version&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If those return the version, you should be ready to go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9Dh_cxhK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632533752780/OepdHgwmn.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9Dh_cxhK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632533752780/OepdHgwmn.png" alt="image.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you see an error message saying your system doesn't recognize &lt;code&gt;dotnet&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt;, make sure it's installed properly for your system. You may need to refresh your terminal so it has access to the command line PATH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#running-the-project-locally"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Running the project locally
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's run &lt;code&gt;dotnet new webapi -o &amp;lt;folder&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. The folder is what you want your project to be called; mine is called &lt;code&gt;AdventureWorks.Api&lt;/code&gt;. Feel free to use that 👍🏼&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;dotnet new webapi &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-o&lt;/span&gt; AdventureWorks.Api
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After a few seconds, the project should be created and all set!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To test out the project and see it in action, in the project folder run:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;dotnet run &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-p&lt;/span&gt; AdventureWorks.Api
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UIvYgJi8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632624601836/fdyi5AniywE.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UIvYgJi8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632624601836/fdyi5AniywE.png" alt="image.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will build out the project and start a local development server on your computer on (by default) port 5001. Let's check it out by going here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;https://localhost:5001/swagger&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tRnlgqQi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632619894607/LfCn8HZps.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tRnlgqQi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632619894607/LfCn8HZps.png" alt="image.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cool, the API is up and running locally!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#running-the-project-in-a-docker-container"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Running the project in a Docker container
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll now go over how to run the project within Docker. The difference here is that we'll set up instructions for Docker to do the work of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;building the project&lt;/strong&gt; - gathering dependencies and compiling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;publishing the project&lt;/strong&gt; - preparing and optimizing it for "release"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;creating the running docker container&lt;/strong&gt; - contains the running web API project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason all these steps are used, instead of the steps used to run it locally, is that this is how you'd bundle a typical project in .NET for production. Meaning this way of building the docker image, and running a container based on that image, is optimized and ready to be shipped to users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This docker build can be used to build out projects for real-world use!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lets-try-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Let's try it
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a file, called &lt;code&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt;, which will contain the Docker build instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then paste the following:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight docker"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Base image used to create the final image&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:5.0 AS base&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;WORKDIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; /app&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;EXPOSE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; 80&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Build image which builds the project and prepares the assets for publishing&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:5.0 AS build&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;WORKDIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; /src&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;COPY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; ["AdventureWorks.Api.csproj", ""]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;RUN &lt;/span&gt;dotnet restore &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"./AdventureWorks.Api.csproj"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;COPY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; . .&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;WORKDIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; "/src/."&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;RUN &lt;/span&gt;dotnet build &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"./AdventureWorks.Api.csproj"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-c&lt;/span&gt; Release &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-o&lt;/span&gt; /app/build

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Publish image which sets up the optimized version of the app into a folder&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; build AS publish&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;RUN &lt;/span&gt;dotnet publish &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"./AdventureWorks.Api.csproj"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-c&lt;/span&gt; Release &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-o&lt;/span&gt; /app/publish

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Final image which only contains the published content of the project&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;# This is where the resulting files of the published app are moved to&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; base AS final&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;WORKDIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; /app&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;COPY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; --from=publish /app/publish .&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;ENTRYPOINT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; ["dotnet", "AdventureWorks.Api.dll"]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: There are comments included for each segment so we can understand what Docker is doing in each step.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;code&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt; now contains all the necessary steps for building out the image which will be used to run the app in a container. To build the docker image using the &lt;code&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt;, within the project folder run:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker build &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-t&lt;/span&gt; adventureworks.api &lt;span class="nb"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Breakdown:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;docker build&lt;/code&gt; - Used for building docker images from Dockerfiles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;-t adventureworks.api&lt;/code&gt; - This adds a tag name to the image &lt;code&gt;adventureworks.api&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; - This is saying the Dockerfile is located here&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After loading and going through the steps, docker should have downloaded all required dependencies and followed the steps within the Dockerfile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There should now be an image created with a repository named &lt;code&gt;adventureworks.api&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--P2KbnW8y--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632713050569/BVZLYGZh_.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--P2KbnW8y--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632713050569/BVZLYGZh_.png" alt="image.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is great, this is the final image that we're after which uses as little space possible. Running a container based on this image should be the published version of the app!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To run this image, run:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-p&lt;/span&gt; 5151:80 adventureworks.api
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Breakdown:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;docker run&lt;/code&gt; - Used for running a process in an isolated container&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;-p 5151:80&lt;/code&gt; - Tells docker to map our local port 5151 to port 80 within the container (which is exposed during the build process in our Dockerfile!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;adventureworks.api&lt;/code&gt; - The target image to use as a blueprint for the created container&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_&lt;br&gt;
Note: You may have noticed we're now using port &lt;strong&gt;5151&lt;/strong&gt; this time. This is to help us distinguish local, or container, by having them on different ports!&lt;br&gt;
_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should see something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PopG7QUQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632713810333/SohpGwLZi.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PopG7QUQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632713810333/SohpGwLZi.png" alt="image.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app is now up and running within a docker container! 🎊🎉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To check out the app running in the docker container, we actually can't use the swagger page like before because this app is a release version. Swagger is set up in the &lt;code&gt;Startup.cs&lt;/code&gt; file to only run in development mode!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see the app running by navigating to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://localhost:5151/weatherforecast&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--oY5fbcTB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632714255941/1GVmhzEEe.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--oY5fbcTB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632714255941/1GVmhzEEe.png" alt="image.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_&lt;br&gt;
Note: It's using &lt;code&gt;http://&lt;/code&gt; because the app hasn't been set up to use &lt;code&gt;https://&lt;/code&gt; in the container.&lt;br&gt;
_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you've followed along this far and see the data from that endpoint, congrats! You've successfully run the API in a container! 😎&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much for coming this far in this tutorial! 😀&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To recap, we've:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;built a simple .NET 5 app and ran it locally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ran the app within a docker container&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_&lt;br&gt;
If you're new to Docker, be sure to clean up any unused containers, images, and resources that you no longer need (if you want to free up storage space). You can learn more about that &lt;a href="https://docs.docker.com/config/pruning/"&gt;using the official docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I want to start with a question &lt;em&gt;Have you ever wondered how applications such as Messenger, WhatsApp can update new messages without the need to refresh the page?&lt;/em&gt; Well, in this article we are developing a ToDo with real-time communication so that you can better understand how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#preview"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Preview
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end of this tutorial you will have the following result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7LZFdHWr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cxtpi8ge4erh26xsq3s5.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7LZFdHWr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cxtpi8ge4erh26xsq3s5.gif" alt="Preview Functionality"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prerequisites"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Prerequisites.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have &lt;a href="https://nodejs.org"&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt; installed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a code editor installed (in my case &lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download"&gt;VSCode&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-project"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating project.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a project on my desktop with the name we want to assign it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir todo-realtime&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd todo-realtime&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;code .&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#initialize-project"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Initialize project.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Execute the following commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm init -y&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;tsc --init&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm init -y&lt;/code&gt;: This command generate a file named &lt;em&gt;package.json&lt;/em&gt; in the root of the project, this file contains all the necessary settings for your application to work properly. For more information &lt;a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json"&gt;https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;tsc --init&lt;/code&gt;: This command generate a file name &lt;em&gt;tsconfig.json&lt;/em&gt; This file is similar to a package.json with the difference that it sets up a project with TypeScript. For more information &lt;a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html"&gt;https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perfect, once the above explained, we download some packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm i @feathersjs/feathers @feathersjs/socketio @feathersjs/express&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm i nodemon -D&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setting-server"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setting server.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we are going to configure our project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a file &lt;em&gt;nodemon.json&lt;/em&gt;. This file will be in charge of updating your application every time we make changes to our files that end in &lt;code&gt;.ts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;nodemon.json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"watch"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"src"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"ext"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"ts,json"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"ignore"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"src/**/*.spec.ts"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"node_modules"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"exec"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"ts-node ./src/index.ts"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We update the package.json file and add the following content.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;package.json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"scripts"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"serve"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"nodemon"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"start"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"node ./src/index.ts"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now we create the directory &lt;em&gt;src/index.ts&lt;/em&gt; For verify all correct add the following content and execute &lt;code&gt;npm run serve&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Hello world developers ♥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If everything is correct, we see this in the console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xhQ4_M73--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4xgp55ahb0arl2k51njl.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xhQ4_M73--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4xgp55ahb0arl2k51njl.png" alt="Print message in the console"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perfect, this is all to configure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#developing-the-dev-server"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Developing the dev server.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we are going to do is create a simple development server that can add notes, and later we will add Real-Time support to it. Copy the following content.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;feathers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@feathersjs/feathers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Application&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@feathersjs/express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Application&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;feathers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Allows interpreting json requests.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Allows interpreting urlencoded requests.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;urlencoded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;extended&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Add support REST-API.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;configure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;rest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Use error not found.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;notFound&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// We configure the errors to send a json.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;errorHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}));&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3030&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;App execute in http://localhost:3030&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setting-our-service"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setting our service.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the official Feathers documentation. The &lt;strong&gt;Services&lt;/strong&gt; are the heart of every Feathers application. Services are JavaScript objects (or instances of ES6 classes) that implement certain methods. Feathers itself will also add some additional methods and functionality to its services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imports modules an defined interfaces.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;services&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;note&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ServiceMethods&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@feathersjs/feathers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;NotFound&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@feathersjs/errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;values&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;keys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;prev&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;curr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;prev&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;curr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;curr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;keyof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Note&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;notePatched&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Note&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;defineProperties&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;note&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;values&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;notes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;splice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;notePatched&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;note&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Note&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;notes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;findIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;note&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;note&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;NotFound&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;The note does not exist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;note&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Note&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;notes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;notes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;splice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;note&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once our service is configured, it is time to use it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;NoteService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./services/note.service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Define my service.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/notes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;NoteService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: It is very important that services are defined before error handlers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we test app. Enter to &lt;a href="http://localhost:3030/notes"&gt;http://localhost:3030/notes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--goH_JJAM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yjpf3w5msiu2lq2mlncl.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--goH_JJAM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yjpf3w5msiu2lq2mlncl.png" alt="List of resources."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#we-setting-support-realtime"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  We setting support Real-Time
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this moment we are going to give real time support to our server.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;socketio&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@feathersjs/socketio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@feathersjs/transport-commons&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Add support Real-Time&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;configure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;socketio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// My services...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// We listen connection event and join the channel.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;connection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;connection&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;channel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;everyone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;connection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Publish all events to channel &amp;lt;everyone&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;publish&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;channel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;everyone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#client-development"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Client development.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now is neccessary serve the static files. We do this with the following content.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Server static files.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: For this to work, is neccessary added before sets errors handler, otherwise always &lt;strong&gt;NotFound&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The directory have the following structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--izR_m4we--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/huuw6agtcpifoeby62yb.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--izR_m4we--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/huuw6agtcpifoeby62yb.png" alt="Structure Directory"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setting-frontend"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setting Frontend.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this step we add the styles and scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We added the following to the styles files.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;@import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sx"&gt;url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins&amp;amp;display=swap")&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;@import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sx"&gt;url("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.1/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css")&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;@import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sx"&gt;url("https://unpkg.com/boxicons@2.0.9/css/boxicons.min.css")&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;'Poppins'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;sans-serif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;30px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.spacer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.card-body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;max-height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;50vh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;overflow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We added the styles and scripts of project.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Other tags --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;rel=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"stylesheet"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/css/style.css"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- My scripts --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"//unpkg.com/@feathersjs/client@^4.3.0/dist/feathers.js"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/socket.io/socket.io.js"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/js/app.js"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We establish all the visual section of our app. Copy the following content.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"container-fluid"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"row justify-content-center align-items-center"&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;style=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"min-height: 100vh;"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"col-12 col-sm-8 col-md-6 col-xl-4 p-3"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

          &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"card-header border-0 bg-white"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"d-flex align-items-center text-muted"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;small&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"mx-1"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"box-completed"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/small&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;small&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"mx-1"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"box-pending"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/small&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;small&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"mx-1"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"box-total"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/small&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"spacer"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"btn btn-remove rounded-pill border-0"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'bx bx-trash'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"card-body"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;ul&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"list-group"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"container"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"card-footer border-0 bg-white"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"form"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"form-group py-2"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class="na"&gt;placeholder=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Example: Learning Docker"&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"form-control"&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class="na"&gt;autocomplete=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"off"&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"input"&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"title"&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class="na"&gt;autofocus&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, is moment of added all logic of your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We capture the elements of the DOM.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;container&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;boxCompleted&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;box-completed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;boxPending&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;box-pending&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;boxTotal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;box-total&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;btnRemove&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.btn-remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We configure Feathers.js on the client side.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Instance my app.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;io&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;feathers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Configure transport with SocketIO.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;configure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;feathers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;socketio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Get note service.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;NoteService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;notes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sets values of some variables.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// The id of the notes are stored.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;noteIds&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// All notes.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;notes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We added some functions that modify the header of the card, notes and others.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/**
 * Insert id of the notes selected.
 */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;selectNotes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;noteId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;noteIds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;findIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;noteId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;noteIds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;noteId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;noteIds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;splice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;btnRemove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;disabled&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;noteIds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/**
 * Update stadistic of the notes.
 */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;updateHeader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;completed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;note&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;note&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pending&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;completed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;boxCompleted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;textContent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Completed: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;completed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;boxPending&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;textContent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Pending: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pending&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;boxTotal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;textContent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Total: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/**
 * Update note by Id
 */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;updateElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;noteId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;note&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;notes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;note&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;note&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;noteId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;NoteService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;patch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;note&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;note&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We create a class that will be responsible of the creation of the elements&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/**
 * This class is responsible for the creation,

      <author>Jasmine Tracey</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/jasminetracey/adding-two-factor-auth-to-laravel-8-bootstrap-livewire-fortify-project-4jbh</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In part one of this article, we created our authentication setup using fortify, laravel and bootstrap.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jasminetracey.com/laravel-8-with-bootstrap-livewire-and-fortify"&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In part two of this article, we covered updating your profile information and how to change your password from your profile page using livewire  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jasminetracey.com/updating-laravel-8-user-profile-information-using-bootstrap-livewire-and-fortify"&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, We will cover:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;adding two-factor auth to your project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#clone-part-one-of-our-project"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Clone part one of our project
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--branch&lt;/span&gt; starter2 git@github.com:jasminetracey/lara8auth.git
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;lara8auth
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Open your cloned project in IDE of choice I will be using &lt;a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/"&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#install-alpinejs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Install &lt;a href="https://alpinejs.dev/"&gt;Alpine.js&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be installing alpine.js to do some showing and hiding in the two factor form&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--save&lt;/span&gt; alpinejs
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Import package in the &lt;strong&gt;resources/js/app.js&lt;/strong&gt; file&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Alpine&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;alpinejs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Alpine&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Alpine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Alpine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#update-fortify-provider"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Update Fortify Provider
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin we will be updating our fortify provider to enable the 2factor page when the user logs in.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;boot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="mf"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Fortify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;twoFactorChallengeView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;view&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'auth.two-factor-challenge'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="mf"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Create two-factor auth view&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;touch &lt;/span&gt;resources/views/auth/two-factor-challenge.blade.php
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@extends('layouts.app') 

@section('content')
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"container"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;x-data=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"{ recovery: false }"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"row justify-content-center"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"col-md-8"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"card"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"card-header"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{{ __('Login') }}&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"card-body"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"alert alert-info"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;role=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"alert"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;x-show=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"! recovery"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                        {{ __('Please confirm access to your account by entering the authentication
                        code provided by your authenticator application.') }}
                    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

                    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"alert alert-info"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;role=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"alert"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;x-show=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"recovery"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                        {{ __('Please confirm access to your account by entering one of your
                        emergency recovery codes.') }}
                    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

                    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;method=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"POST"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;action=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"{{ route('two-factor.login') }}"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                        @csrf

                        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"form-group row"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;x-show=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"! recovery"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;for=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"code"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"col-md-4 col-form-label text-md-right"&lt;/span&gt;

                            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

                            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"col-md-6"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt;

                                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

                                    &lt;span class="na"&gt;x-on:click=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"
                                                                    recovery = true;
                                                                    $nextTick(() =&amp;gt; { $refs.recovery_code.focus() })
                                                                "&lt;/span&gt;
                                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                                    {{ __('Use a recovery code') }}
                                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

                                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt;
                                    &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"button"&lt;/span&gt;
                                    &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"btn btn-secondary"&lt;/span&gt;
                                    &lt;span class="na"&gt;x-show=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"recovery"&lt;/span&gt;
                                    &lt;span class="na"&gt;x-on:click=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"
                                                                    recovery = false;
                                                                    $nextTick(() =&amp;gt; { $refs.code.focus() })
                                                                "&lt;/span&gt;
                                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                                    {{ __('Use an authentication code') }}
                                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
@endsection
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#update-user-model"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Update User Model
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also need to tell our user model that we will be enabling 2factor authentication so we need to add a trait &lt;code&gt;TwoFactorAuthenticatable&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Laravel\Fortify\TwoFactorAuthenticatable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Authenticatable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;MustVerifyEmail&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;HasFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Notifiable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;TwoFactorAuthenticatable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-livewire-enable-twofactor-form"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Create livewire enable two-factor form
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This form will be used to manage 2factor authentication. This includes enabling, disabling, and regenerating recovrey codes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From your terminal run the following command &lt;code&gt;php artisan livewire:make two-factor-form&lt;/code&gt; This will create our livewire component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your &lt;code&gt;resources/views/livewire/profile-form.blade.php&lt;/code&gt; add the following code to create our form fields.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;section&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"my-5"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    @if (session('status') == 'two-factor-authentication-enabled')
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"mb-4 text-sm font-medium text-green-600"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        Two factor authentication has been enabled.
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    @endif

    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"card"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"card-body"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"card-title"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Two-Factor Authentication&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h5&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

            @if (!empty($this-&amp;gt;user-&amp;gt;two_factor_secret)) 

                @if ($showQrCode)
                    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                        Two factor authentication is now enabled. Scan the following QR code using your
                        phone's authenticator application.
                    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

                    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{!! $this-&amp;gt;user-&amp;gt;twoFactorQrCodeSvg() !!}&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                @endif 

                @if ($showRecoveryCodes)
                    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"mt-4"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                            Store these recovery codes in a secure password manager. They can be used to
                            recover access to your account if your two factor authentication device is lost.
                        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

                        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                            @foreach (json_decode(decrypt($this-&amp;gt;user-&amp;gt;two_factor_recovery_codes), true) as
                            $code)
                                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{{ $code }}&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                            @endforeach
                        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                @endif

                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"mt-4"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    @if ($showRecoveryCodes)
                        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;wire:click=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"regenerateRecoveryCodes"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"btn btn-secondary"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                            Regenerate Recovery Codes
                        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    @else
                        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;wire:click=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"showRecoveryCodes"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"btn btn-secondary"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                            Show Recovery Codes
                        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    @endif

                    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;wire:click=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"disableTwoFactorAuth"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"btn btn-primary"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                        Disable Two-Factor Authentication
                    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

            @else
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;You have not enabled two factor authentication.&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

                    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;wire:click=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"enableTwoFactorAuth"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"btn btn-primary"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                        Enable Two-Factor Authentication
                    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            @endif
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After adding our view we need to add the code in the livewire component file app\Http\Livewire\TwoFactorForm.php to interact with fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will first add two fields to the component to hide and show QRCode and the RecoveryCode. And the function to toggle showing the recovery codes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$showQrCode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$showRecoveryCodes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;showRecoveryCodes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;showRecoveryCodes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Next we will include a user property to the component because we will be interacting with a couple fields on the authenticated user.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;getUserProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first function we will be adding is the &lt;code&gt;enableTwoFactorAuth&lt;/code&gt; function. This is the one that gets the ball rolling and allowing the user to setup two-factor authentication. We will be using the EnableTwoFactorAuthentication action that comes with fortify.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;enableTwoFactorAuth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;EnableTwoFactorAuthentication&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$enable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$enable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;showQrCode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;showRecoveryCodes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Remember to import the EnableTwoFactorAuthentication action&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next function will be the &lt;code&gt;disableTwoFactorAuth&lt;/code&gt; function. If for some reason the user no longer wishes to have to factor authentication on their account we will provide the option to disable it. Again we will be using a fortify action DisableTwoFactorAuthentication.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;disableTwoFactorAuth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;DisableTwoFactorAuthentication&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$disable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$disable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Remember to import the DisableTwoFactorAuthentication action&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally we will be adding a function to regenerate recovery codes. These recovery codes allow the user to authenticate if they lose access to their mobile device.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;regenerateRecoveryCodes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;GenerateNewRecoveryCodes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$generate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$generate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;showRecoveryCodes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Remember to import the GenerateNewRecoveryCodes action&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we will add our component to the resources/views/profile.blade.php page so that we can see the form when we visit the profile page.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@extends('layouts.app') 

@section('content')
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"container"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;livewire:profile-form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;livewire:password-change-form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;livewire:two-factor-form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
@endsection
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now when you go to &lt;code&gt;/profile&lt;/code&gt; you should have the working 2factor form.&lt;/p&gt;
