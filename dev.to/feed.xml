      <description>&lt;h2 id="what-is-a-web-designer"&gt;What is a Web Designer?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you both creative and technically inclined? You may want to consider a career as a web designer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web designers build or redesign websites. They understand what it takes to make a website functional and easy to use, but also understand what is needed to make it aesthetically appealing to the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web design is a rapidly growing industry, as digital media has become part of everyone's lives and people rely on the web for their communications, information, shopping, social life, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Frontend Development 2021</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frontend Development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Every business, brand, and idea has a website. As a result, building websites, called front-end development, is one of the simplest and most profitable ways to enter the world of software development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a website building, Front-end plays a first and foremost role. As a result of good Front-end development, the website can reach more people and serve the purpose. Front-end development helps optimizes navigation on a website which makes easier for visitor to find what they are looking for on the site. It calls for a clean, well-structed and carefully planned layout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For 2021 :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Front-end web development has become more difficult in recent years. There's a lot more to it than HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are several technologies to master, as well as numerous activities. You will certainly become a good front-end web developer if you have the passion ,discipline and patience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9NunaTo0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5na2t5kbzyf4t51t78zc.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9NunaTo0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5na2t5kbzyf4t51t78zc.png" alt="jobpick.in"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Frontend and Backend&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two paths towards becoming a web developer: the back-end or the front-end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Front-end developers&lt;/strong&gt;, on the other hand, get to build everything a user touches and interacts with on the screen, such as layouts, information, engagement, etc. Front-end developers are both creative and tech-savvy, and act as the bridge between designers and back-end programmers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A frontend must provide a good user experience and should be convenient for the end user to operate. It should be able to perform proper validation of any data sent by the user and should be responsive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Back-end developers&lt;/strong&gt; build server-side software. They’re responsible for all the performance, stability, security and speed of your site or app, all of which power the front-end or user-facing side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So frontend or backend it depends on need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you just need to provide information, frontend development is more important because you don’t need a backend to display simple content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you only need to serve data, an API will suffice, which means backend development is more important (since no frontend is required).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Static and Dynamic Site&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A static site that only displays text or images and has no interaction between the site and the user, does not require back-end development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dynamic site that requires interaction between the site and the user (such as filling in and submitting a form), does require back-end development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frameworks&lt;/strong&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Framework will help you a lot with development. The framework will give you the basic structure, some guidelines, and even some pre-build elements. Besides, almost every company uses any framework so it will be much easier to get your dream job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 most popular&lt;/strong&gt; front-end frameworks in the market right now: React, Angular and Vue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow these steps :&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Learn the basics of how websites work, front-end vs back-end, and using a code editor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Learn basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Learn tools: package managers, build tools, version control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Learn Sass, responsive design, JavaScript frameworks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Learn back-end basics: servers and databases, programming languages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Maintain an active Github profile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Develop your own projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of free learning sources available for learning Frontend Development as well as backend development .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the interim, find open source projects or help your friends with their sites ,use this opportunity to learn to manage expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How Much Does a Smart Mirror Cost?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Someone says a smart mirror is a two-way mirror with an inbuilt display behind the glass. is that true? It was partially right to a point, but not all correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Smart mirror is a combination of two-way mirrors, hidden computer components, and interactive screens. However, these are only the combination of hardware, the smart software or solution is the heart for smart mirrors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, do you think mirrors that meet the above conditions belong to the smart ones? not really, let's discuss the false and truly magic mirrors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;False Intelligent Mirror&lt;br&gt;
When you search for a smart mirror on Amazon, the first thing you see is all kinds of glass mirrors. they are not just traditional glass mirrors, there are no exceptions to adding extra features. Such as Led Lighting mirror, music mirror, Bluetooth mirror, mirror with LCD display or screen... Do these belong to the smart mirror' category? or is it a truly smart mirror concept? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared with a basic glass mirror, these functional mirrors made big progress, providing more humanized functions to users. It was a smarter mirror in a certain stage of mirrors’ developing progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, we have entered into a modern information society. All aspects of life have broken through the traditional concept of intelligence. Smartphones, smart Television, smart lights… smart products are everywhere. These smart products are invariably engaged with smart hardware and solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, do you think the above mirrors are still smart? or we should call it a false smart mirror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truly Smart Mirror &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A truly smart mirror was invented in 2016, quite a young product, and a new mirror when we look back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology and smartphones have become major trends nowadays, especially when Apple and Android smartphones become popular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real smart mirrors have a smart system in common. Android is the mainstream system due to its open-source character. The smart mirror system provides a friendly interface and displays various content on the mirror screen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s discuss the two types of smart mirrors below&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smart TV Mirror&lt;br&gt;
Smart mirror with TV also called mirror tv or tv mirror, which has been widely used in luxury hotels or resorts for years. The TV mirror is a two-way mirror with a television built-in behind. Basically, it’s the combination of television and a two-way glass mirror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new arrival television mirror is loaded with an Android system, which provides an easy and friendly interface, WiFi capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget the drawback of tv mirrors, you have to control them via remote controller, which underlines the touch screen smart mirror’s advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of a smart mirror tv is around 400 ~ 600 dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smart Touchscreen Mirror&lt;br&gt;
The ultimate smart mirror for sale now, which works with a hidden touch screen behind the two-way mirror, all controlled by a microcomputer and smart components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a true sense of magic mirror, it covers all the features of the above mirrors. Such as backlit Led light, Auto defog and water resistance, temperature displaying… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the accomplishment of smart technology, the touch screen mirrors are far greater than these. Thanks to the WiFi and Bluetooth connection with the Internet, it allows the digital mirrors to display all the information and media you want to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine that when you wake up, the bathroom mirror says “good morning” to you, displaying the latest weather, news, traffic to office, meeting, emails… how cool is that!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smart mirror systems are also compatible with various smart applications. Such as YouTube, Spotify, Netflix, Amazon, ESPN… We always watch videos or news while we brush our teeth, with our smartphones. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s time to forget about the tiny smartphone screen now. The smart bathroom mirror is integrated with a 21.5-inch touch screen. It supports touch control like your phone, in large size of the screen. Free your hands and enjoy a comfortable and relaxed morning, get ready for the day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget the bathroom smart mirror with inbuilt speakers, and listen to the latest online music. Have a bath and make yourself feel like in a bowl, that’s the essence of the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, more and more smart devices are compatible with each other. Certainly, the smart mirrors connect. Through the Bluetooth connection, the smart scale, smart wear, and other health care products can connect with your bathroom mirror. Display your BMI, skin quality, blood pressure, steps on the mirror screen. Such a helpful mirror for modern life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of a smart touchscreen mirror is from 1000 to 5000 dollars, some even higher, but we believe that price is not a realistic one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to Choose the Right One for You&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to choose the right magic mirror for you? It's a question to be resolved before buying a smart mirror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, of course, we have to measure the dimension of mirrors and vanity cabinets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most popular dimension mirror is below, with different costs. To ensure the mirror’s dimensions match our home decor projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;60 x 80 cm / 23.6” x 31.5”, about 1000 dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;70 x 90 cm / 27.6” x 35.4”, around 1200 dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;70 x 100 cm / 27.6” x 39.4”, around 1400 dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;80 x 120 cm / 31.5” x 47.3”, around 1800 dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;90 x 150 cm / 35.4” x 59.1”, around 2000 dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, how large of a touch screen do you need? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many would raise a question, isn’t a bigger display screen better? Not really, to provide comfortable visual effects, we have to keep our distance from the screen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to understand if you hold your smartphone screen to your eyeball, not too far, not too close. To measure the dimension of your sink, which is related to your mirror size closely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few sizes of touch screens for smart mirrors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7 ~ 10-inch screen: suitable for small mirrors such as 50 x 70 cm, or even smaller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;15.6 inches screen: suitable for mirrors from 60 x 80 cm to 70 x 90 cm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;21.5 inches screen: The most popular size, up to 80 x 120 cm mirror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;32 inches screen and larger: suitable for mirrors from 90 x 150 cm or bigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regular sink's depth is about 50cm, in this case, you can choose any size of mirror screen 15.6 inches. While you have a large sink, you have to consider the mirror screen from 21.5 inches at least. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where to buy these mirrors?&lt;br&gt;
It’s interesting that we seldom see this new generation mirror anywhere nearby. Plenty of us google where to buy a smart mirror?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Purchase from Online&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon and Wayfair are always the best options for us. Sorry to disappoint you, when you search for smart mirrors on Amazon, 99% of the search results are false ones as we discussed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for such an awkward result is because the online companies didn’t set the rules. Most consumers get used to the featured mirror as a smart one, that’s not right. On the other hand, the real smart mirrors are quite a few, leading to less traffic on the searching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on such circumstances, the Alexa or Google AR could not define or recognize which mirror belongs to real smart ones, which are not. It’s understandable that most non-smart mirrors are listed on the top of searches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some truly smart mirrors listed, such as HiMirror, Electric Mirror (recently disappeared), Capstone, Vercon, Ad Notom…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying smart from online: from $1500 up to $3000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visit Construction Materials Stores&lt;br&gt;
Home depot is always the best place to find new mirrors, Lowes also catches up with Homedepot in this field. Frustratingly, there are a quite few stores that displayed smart mirrors, but with a small screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As per the marketing analyst, the big stores worry high-price products have less fluidity. Most of them are still under the testing stage, to see how the market reacts with this high-price mirror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost of buying a smart mirror from retailers: starts from $800 for limited models and sizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying From Overseas Suppliers&lt;br&gt;
With the rapid development of international logistics, DHL, FedEx, and TNT… all provide door-to-door delivery for single purchasing. On the other hand, the delivery rate is also not out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest concern comes from various considerable quality suppliers. After all, this industry is still under development, not all the factories are trusted quality products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost of purchasing a smart mirror from overseas: factory cost plus overseas shipping around $1200.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusions of smart mirror cost&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smart mirrors keep growing in the past years, becoming the most trending mirror for luxury and smart home or hospitality solutions. As this industry develops, smart mirror prices definitely become more affordable to all families. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>App Development Complete Roadmap -2021</title>
      <author>Bikash</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 05:29:55 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/inncod/app-development-complete-roadmap-2021-24ba</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/inncod/app-development-complete-roadmap-2021-24ba</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1&gt;Best Way to Become Android Developer – A Complete Roadmap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android is an open-source operating system, based on the Linux kernel and used in mobile devices like smartphones, tablets, etc. Further, it was developed for smartwatches and Android TV. Each of them has a specialized interface. Android has been one of the best-selling OS for smartphones. Android OS was developed by Android Inc. which Google bought in 2005. Various applications like games, music player, camera, etc. are built for these smartphones for running on Android. Google Play Store features quite 3.3 million apps. Today, Android remains dominant on a global scale. Approximately 75% of the world population prefers using Android as against 15% of iOS. It is an operating system that has a huge market for apps. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is known to everyone that how popular is Android nowadays. Now the questions arise are, &lt;strong&gt;Why Android(&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decide the Goal First?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;), how to start? Where&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; to start? What topics one should cover? etc, etc. &lt;/strong&gt;Do you need to learn all the concepts from a book or you should go with some online tutorials or you should learn Android by doing some projects on it? So in this article, we are going to discuss all these things in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Why Android?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decide the Goal First?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So before jumping into the complete Roadmap of Android one should have a clear goal in his/her mind that why he/she wants to learn Android? Is it for your college academic projects? or is it for your long-term career? or do you want to build your apps to start your business? So first make a clear goal. &lt;strong&gt;Why do you want to learn Android? &lt;/strong&gt;For example, if you want to learn Android for your college Academic projects then it’s enough to just learn the beginner things in Android. Similarly, if you want to build your long term career then you should learn the professional or advanced things also. So it’s on your hand and it’s your decision why you want to learn Android.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How to Learn Android?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Android, programming is done in two languages &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.codelivly.com/what-is-java-the-basis-of-java-explained/"&gt;JAVA&lt;/a&gt; or Kotlin&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;XML(Extension Markup Language). &lt;/strong&gt;The XML file deals with the design, presentation, layouts, blueprint, etc (as a front-end) while the JAVA or KOTLIN deals with working of buttons, variables, storing, etc (as a back-end).&lt;strong&gt; And &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; biggest confusion for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;an&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Android beginner is which language to choose &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;between&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Java and Kotlin? &lt;/strong&gt;So let me try to overcome the confusion first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Java or Kotlin?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Java is the official language for Android App Development and consequently, it is the most used language as well. Many of the apps in the Play Store are built with Java and it is also the most supported language by Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kotlin is a cross-platform programming language that may be used as an alternative to Java for Android App Development.&lt;strong&gt; It has also been introduced as a secondary “official” Java language in 2017&lt;/strong&gt;. The only sizable difference is that Kotlin removes the superfluous features of Java such as null pointer exceptions. It also removes the necessity of ending every line with a semicolon. In short, Kotlin is much simpler for beginners to try as compared to Java and it can also be used as an “entry point” for Android App Development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So my recommendation for a beginner is to go with Java first, then jump to Kotlin. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Kotlin?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Because Google has already declared Kotlin as the first-class language. And then Why Java? So in order to get the most out of Kotlin, we must have a knowledge of Java. So start with the Java basics then the Kotlin basics then go for Android Studio.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning Resources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of resources and videos available online and it’s confusing for developers where to start learning all the concepts. Initially, as a beginner, if you get overwhelmed with so many concepts then don’t be afraid and stop learning. Have patience, explore, and stay committed to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best way to learn Android is by developing some baby projects to some advanced projects.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some useful learning resource links available at GeeksforGeeks:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.codelivly.com/what-is-java-the-basis-of-java-explained/"&gt;Java Programming Language &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kotlin Programming Language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Android &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Roadmap to Learn&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with the Overview of Android. Read some android related blogs and also research some Android-related things. For example read blogs on Introduction to Android Development, History of Android, Different Versions of Android, and also topics like Why Kotlin will replace Java for Android App Development, etc. etc. and make a complete mind makeup to start your journey on Android. Make yourself self-motivated to learn Android and build some awesome projects on Android. Do it regularly and also start learning one by one new concept on Android. It will be very better to join some workshops or conferences on Android before you start your journey. Make your goal clear and move on toward your goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Programming&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One may consider this step as a prerequisite. Learn these programming languages before you start learning Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Java Programming Language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kotlin Programming Language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sound Knowledge of XML (Extensible Markup Language)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Android Studio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s better to know your tools before you are going to use it. Android Studio is the official Integrated Development Environment for Google’s Android operating system, built on JetBrains’ IntelliJ IDEA software and designed specifically for Android development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;File Structure:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AndroidManifest.xml file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Java file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drawable file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Layout file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mipmap file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;colors.xml file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;strings.xml file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;styles.xml file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;build.gradle(Module: app) file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Android Studio Overview:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reopen, close, save the project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new activity, classes, drawable resource files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the app on AVD of Emulator or in a real device etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Android Components&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some necessary building blocks that an Android application consists of. These loosely coupled components are bound by the application manifest file which contains a description of each component and how they interact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Activity:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activity life cycle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handle Activity State Changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand Tasks and Back Stack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Processes and Application Lifecycle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Services:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Types of Android Services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Life Cycle of Android Services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Content Provider:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Content URI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operations in Content Provider&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working of the Content Provider&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a Content Provider&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Broadcast Receiver:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Implicit Broadcast Exceptions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Simple UI Design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you got an idea about the different components of Android then start exploring some simple UI design which is given below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Explore different layouts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frame&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constraint&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;View Elements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TextView&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EditText&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buttons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ImageView&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Intent:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implicit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explicit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intent Filter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) Complex UI Design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have a command on simple UI design then solely move to the complex UI design part such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ListView&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RecycleVIew&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fragments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dialogs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Toast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bottom Sheets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigation Drawer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tabs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Material Design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some inserting Animations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6) Storage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Android, there are three types of the storage system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shared Preferences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File System&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;RoomDB&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7) Build&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gradle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debug/ Release Configuration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8) Threading&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Threads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9) Debugging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important skills of a developer is debugging skills. So the developer must learn these things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exceptions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Error Handling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory Profiling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10) Memory Leaks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cause of memory leaks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detecting and fixing memory leaks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Context&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11) Third-Party Libraries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Image Loading Libraries&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Glide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Picasso&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fresco&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;COIL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dependency Injection&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dragger&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Networking&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Retrofit&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multithreading&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coroutines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rxjava&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12) Android Jetpack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On its official site&lt;/strong&gt;, it says Android Jetpack is a set of libraries, tools, and architectural guidance to help make it quick and easy to build great Android apps. It provides common infrastructure code so you can focus on what makes your app unique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AppCompat library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Architecture components,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Animation and transitions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Android Ktx&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WorkManager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13) Android Architecture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three famous architecture in the Android world are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MVVM (Model–View–ViewModel)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MVI (Model-View-Intent)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MVP (Model View Presenter)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14) Firebase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analytics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remote Config&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;App Indexing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15) Unit Testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local Unit Testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instrumentation Testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16) Security&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encrypt / Decrypt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proguard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17) App Release&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Signed APK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play Store&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18) Keep Practicing and Read Some Android Tips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Practice makes a man perfect” which tells the importance of continuous practice in any subject to learn anything. So keep practicing and read some Android tips such as Tips to Improve Your Android Development Skills, Tips to Get Your Android App Featured on Google Play Store, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Data Science Complete Roadmap</title>
      <author>Coder Boy</author>

      <link>https://dev.to/codingninjaa/data-science-complete-roadmap-5kg</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/codingninjaa/data-science-complete-roadmap-5kg</guid>
      <description>&lt;p id="2998"&gt;Around three years ago, I did an undergraduate degree in computer science. I chose to major in data science since it was so hyped up at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d6d8"&gt;I realized one year back that my degree did not equip me with the skills necessary to become a data scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b99f"&gt;And it cost my parents approximately $25K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9466"&gt;This was before I knew about online learning platforms like edX and Coursera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ca5"&gt;I taught myself all the skills required to become a data scientist. And I learnt it all outside my degree — I learnt it online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e31a"&gt;Now, I&lt;span id="rmm"&gt;’&lt;/span&gt;m working as a data scientist for a data and AI company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c563"&gt;In an article I wrote last year, I provided a list of courses you could take to break into the data science industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7681"&gt;I will refresh that list here, and provide you with a few more learning resources that will help you break into data science in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7681"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Read More: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.codelivly.com/a-complete-data-science-roadmap-in-2021/"&gt;Data Science Complete Roadmap 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Will Python Rule The Future - Everything You beed to Know</title>
      <author>Coder Boy</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 04:17:07 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/codingninjaa/will-python-rule-the-future-everything-you-beed-to-know-2m1e</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/codingninjaa/will-python-rule-the-future-everything-you-beed-to-know-2m1e</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;There’s no question that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Python&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;is hugely popular with software developers, or that its popularity continues to rise. TIOBE, a software company that publishes a measure of the popularity of programming languages every month,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;reported in November&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;that Python had climbed into the number two slot for the first time, passing Java. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t the only indication of Python’s success, nor much of a surprise to the acolytes. Indeed, other rankings have also recorded Python’s ascent. The IEEE, for instance, rates languages according to their suitability — and in 2020 they put Python at the top of the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read More: &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;url=https://www.codelivly.com/will-python-ever-rule-the-world/&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwj1-risz6ryAhVH6XMBHSQgBf0QFnoECAsQAQ&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0HsVch-qGxTKaxnvK-Is2_&amp;amp;cshid=1628741744900" rel="nofollow"&gt;Will Python Rule The World&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/codingninjaa/10-magical-javascript-tips-for-every-web-developer-145o</guid>
      <description>&lt;p id="f6cc"&gt;In this article, we will discuss the 15 useful JavaScript tips for every web developer to save their valuable and precious time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="e1bb"&gt;I am always ready to learn although I do not always like being taught&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="0fe5"&gt;— Winston Churchill&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h1 id="fa85"&gt;Tip 1. Flatten the array of the array&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="4e31"&gt;This tip will help you to flatten a deeply nested array of arrays by using &lt;code&gt;Infinity&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;flat&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span id="e3aa"&gt;var array = [123, 500, [1, 2, [34, 56, 67, [234, 1245], 900]], 845, [30257]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id="16da"&gt;//flatten array of array&lt;br&gt;array.flat(Infinity)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id="b0d8"&gt;// output:&lt;br&gt;// [123, 500, 1, 2, 34, 56, 67, 234, 1245, 900, 845, 30257]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h1 id="902c"&gt;Tip 2. Easy Exchange Variables&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="ebf9"&gt;You probably swap the two variables using a third variable &lt;code&gt;temp&lt;/code&gt;. But this tip will show you a new way to exchange variables using destructuring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span id="298c"&gt;//example 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id="3316"&gt;var a = 6;&lt;br&gt;var b = 7;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id="b133"&gt;[a,b] = [b,a]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id="aa36"&gt;console.log(a,b) // 7 6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Hello everyone, my name is suman and I'm a frontend developer. In this blog post, I would like to share 10 VS code extensions that every frontend developer should use. The purpose of using these extensions is to write faster, cleaner, and more consistent code. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let's Jump in!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Final React Project</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I did it - I finished my final project for Flatiron School!! It is a simple Symptom Tracking app built with Ruby on Rails backend and React frontend. This was difficult to do, partially because I found React to be the most challenging thing we've learned in Flatiron, and partially because I was doing it after sustaining an injury (my own symptom journal during this time was the inspiration for the app - I took my little notebook and made it digital!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite React being challenging to learn (in my opinion), it is a lot of fun once you get over the learning curve. React is a JavaScript library and a powerful tool for building SPAs. It relies on state management and rendering it to the DOM. In my app, I also used Redux. Redux is a way to store and interact with state and allow the data to be manipulated and passed between components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some useful graphics that helped me understand React and Redux:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jF97mrEf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/giX0mrx.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jF97mrEf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/giX0mrx.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QUsPlGku--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/jl9CSOO.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QUsPlGku--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/jl9CSOO.gif" alt="gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of the way state is used in my project. This is from the Form component:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;class SymptomsForm extends Component {
  state = {
    title: "",
    severity: "",
    notes: "",
  };

  handleChange = (e) =&amp;gt; {
    const { name, value } = e.target;
    this.setState({
      \[name\]: value,
    });
  };

  handleSubmit = (e) =&amp;gt; {
    e.preventDefault();
    this.props.addSymptom(this.state);
    this.setState({
      title: "",
      severity: "",
      notes: "",
    });
    if (
      this.state\["title"\] !== "" &amp;amp;&amp;amp;
      this.state\["severity"\] !== "" &amp;amp;&amp;amp;
      this.state\["notes"\] !== ""
    ) {
      this.props.history.push("/");
    }
  };
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is also where Redux comes in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State is within an object tree inside of store. In order to change that state tree, an action must be used (an object), and that action must be dispatched to the store. Dispatching requires using reducer functions. This is an example from my project of those both look:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action which creates the symptom after the form is filled out and the user hits submit:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;export const addSymptom = (symptom) =&amp;gt; {
  return (dispatch) =&amp;gt; {
    fetch("http://localhost:3000/symptoms", {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify(symptom),
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    })
      .then((res) =&amp;gt; {
        if (res.status === 422) {
          alert("Please fill out all fields");
        }
        return res.json();
      })
      .then((symptoms) =&amp;gt;
        dispatch({ type: "ADD\_SYMPTOMS", payload: symptoms })
      );
  };
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reducer:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;export const symptomsReducer = (state = \[\], action) =&amp;gt; {
  switch (action.type) {
    // case 'FETCH\_SYMPTOMS':
    //   return action.payload;
    case 'ADD\_SYMPTOMS':
      return \[...state, action.payload\];
    // case 'DELETE\_SYMPTOM':

    // return \[      
    //   ...state.filter(item =&amp;gt; item.id !== action.payload)
    //  \];
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The switch statement here allows the program to determine which function should be executed based on type. I commented out the other functions to show what the reducer would look like only with the addSymptom action. The reducer sees that the action was taken, and returns the state accordingly. Payload is basically just the data in the action object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I think React is great tool, and I definitely plan to expand this project. I want to add a user auth, and a heat map calendar like the GitHub one to reflect entries. Stay tuned! For now, here are the links to this project:&lt;/p&gt;
