&lt;p&gt;Hello Devs, if you want to become a Cloud expert in 2022 and looking for best Cloud computing courses then you have come to the right place. In the past, I have shared &lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/10-best-python-3-courses-on-udemy-ddd4e3ec5dbf"&gt;best Python courses&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/07/top-5-online-courses-to-learn-blockchain.html#axzz6tFYADc00"&gt;best Blockchain courses&lt;/a&gt; and today I will share similar resources to learn Cloud computing in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud Computing is becoming an essential skill for any Software developer or IT professional today as more and more companies are moving towards Cloud for their infrastructure and service needs. It pays to &lt;em&gt;learn Cloud Computing today&lt;/em&gt; as the most likely application will be solely built and deployed in the Cloud in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what your role is, if you are working in technology, cloud computing will affect you, one way or another. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if you want to learn cloud computing, you have come to the right place; in this article, I will share some of the best courses to learn Cloud computing basics in general and with &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/05/top-5-courses-to-crack-aws-solutions-architect-associate-certification-exam-SAA-C01.html"&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/07/top-5-google-cloud-platform-gcp-courses-certifications-online.html"&gt;GCP&lt;/a&gt; in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I have had a tough time finding an excellent course to learn Cloud Computing; after trying a handful of courses on &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/08/top-10-udemy-courses-and-certifications-for-programmers.html"&gt;Udemy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/10/udemy-vs-pluralsight-review-which-is-better-to-learn-code.html"&gt;Pluralsight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/01/top-10-free-interactive-online-courses.html"&gt;Educative&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/02/10-best-coursera-courses--for-python.html"&gt;Coursera&lt;/a&gt;, I have finally zeroed down on following five directions to learn the basics of Cloud Computing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These courses provide a broad introduction to all aspects of cloud computing, but before going to see these courses let's first understand what it is Cloud and what benefit it provides? What problem does Cloud solve, and why is there so much buzz about it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud has a different meaning for different people and is also used to refer to other things in a different context, but in general, the Cloud means a host of services that are ready to use for your application. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many Cloud service provider companies like AWS (&lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/top-5-amazon-web-services-or-aws-courses-to-learn-online-free-and-best-of-lot-d94e192054b7"&gt;Amazon Web Service&lt;/a&gt;), GCP (&lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/07/top-5-courses-to-become-google-cloud-professional-architect.html"&gt;Google Cloud Platform&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/02/top-5-AZ-900-exam-Azure-Fundamentals-certification-practice-tests-and-mock-exams-to.html"&gt;Microsoft Azure&lt;/a&gt; provide these services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, what are those services? Well, these could be servers, networks, storage, computing power, and other infra-related services commonly offered and referred to as &lt;strong&gt;IaaS&lt;/strong&gt; (Infrastructure as service). There are other cloud models, like *&lt;em&gt;PaaS *&lt;/em&gt;(Platform as Service) and *&lt;em&gt;SaaS *&lt;/em&gt;(Software as service), but let's focus on IaaS first to understand the benefits provided by Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not long ago, to host a real-world E-commerce application, you needed to buy servers, networks, and storage and set them up to your requirements, like installing the required software and &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2021/08/top-5-courses-to-learn-operating-system.html"&gt;operating system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the companies have their own Data Center where these servers are kept, and there was a high cost involved to keep those data centers running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was just the initial time and cost for setting up the server. Their utilization was also poor; secondary servers are often idle, just wasting that precious CPU and memory power. The effect was more evident on big companies that own thousands of servers across multiple data centers worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon was one such company that quickly realized that by using virtualization, they could use the computing power of their infrastructure, giving birth to the Cloud. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can spin up a &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/12/top-5-free-microsoft-sql-server-and-transact-sql-online-courses.html#axzz5hG3koJem"&gt;server&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/05/top-5-sql-and-database-courses-to-learn-online.html"&gt;database&lt;/a&gt;, and network in the Cloud very quickly with just some clicks, and you will only be charged for whatever you use. So this solves the problem of setup, utilization, and scalability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you know what Cloud is and what benefits it offers in terms of cost, ease of setup, efficiency, and scalability, it's time to deep dive and goes through these online training courses, which will help you learn Cloud Computing fundamentals better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-introduction-to-cloud-computing-on-amazon-aws-for-beginners-udemy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fintroduction-to-cloud-computing-on-amazon-aws-for-beginners%2F"&gt;Introduction to Cloud Computing on Amazon AWS for Beginners&lt;/a&gt; [Udemy]
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started learning about Cloud, it was a very abstract thing for me; I couldn't understand what the Cloud was and why everyone talked about it. It was like a person without a face, but when I learned about AWS, I could co-relate various cloud concepts very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, AWS is like putting a face on Cloud, and that's why I recommend this course for anyone starting to learn about Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course explains key concepts of clouds like Iaas, PaaS, and Saas with AWS examples, making it easy to learn what Cloud is and what benefits it offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing AWS is also a plus because it's one of the most popular Cloud platforms, and your experience with AWS will also boost your CV for any AWS job or for a developer job where &lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/11-essential-skills-to-become-software-developer-in-2020-c617e293e90e"&gt;AWS skills&lt;/a&gt; are desired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking about social proof, this course is created by Infinite Skills and has, on average, 4.2 ratings from close to 2400 students, which is excellent. I recommend these books for absolute beginners who want to learn about Cloud computing in general and with AWS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fintroduction-to-cloud-computing-on-amazon-aws-for-beginners%2F"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xzhqtpq6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1YnWDG52KNI/YGa9dBRz68I/AAAAAAAAm00/n4pOUh6WsZA1ftJVkpZTpoECr29UowwwwCLcBGAsYHQ/w463-h274/image.png" alt="Best Cloud Computing Course for Beginners" width="463" height="274"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This course is also part of Coursera's &lt;strong&gt;Cloud Computing Specialization&lt;/strong&gt;, which is nothing but a collection of individual sessions to learn different areas of Cloud computing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, if you find Coursera courses and helpful specialization, then you should also join the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=40328&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fcourseraplus"&gt;Coursera Plus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a subscription plan from Coursera which provides you &lt;strong&gt;unlimited access&lt;/strong&gt; to their most popular courses, specialization, professional certificate, and guided projects. It cost around $399/year, but it's completely worth your money as you get &lt;em&gt;unlimited certificates.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=40328&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Flearn%2Fcloud-computing"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--36IvDT0n--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RUJa3jIIk7M/XRyStFibzKI/AAAAAAAAZjc/Q1EUQffRXx8-wjS3uZucTPrKuGuwjsxDwCLcBGAs/s400/Cloud%252BComputing%252BConcepts%252Bby%252BCoursera%252BOnline%252Bcourse.jpg" alt="best Coursera course to learn Cloud Computing" width="400" height="227"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of you might know that I also have a Pluralsight membership, and it's one of my go-to places for online learning. So, when I started learning about Cloud Computing in general and &lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/top-10-courses-to-learn-amazon-web-services-aws-cloud-in-2020-best-and-free-317f10d7c21d"&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt; in particular, I looked into Pluralsight for some learning material and got hooked to this course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course provides a good overview of cloud platforms, including Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, and private clouds (bringing cloud technology on-premises).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time you're done, you'll know what cloud computing is all about and be ready to start exploring specific implementations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you have a &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1193463/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Flearn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pluralsight membership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this course is for you. If you don't have a membership, it's worth getting as you get access to almost 6000+ top-quality courses for just $29/month or $299/year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to try, you can also access this course for free by taking their &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2017/12/top-10-pluralsight-courses-java-and-web-developers.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10-day free trial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  5. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=CuIbQrBnhiw&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Faws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02%2F"&gt;Ultimate AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate by Stephane Maarek &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest with you, this course teaches you the most about cloud and cloud computing. I learned most when preparing for the &lt;a href="https://www.java67.com/2020/04/how-to-paas-aws-certified-solution-architect-exam-in-2020.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AWS Certified Solution Architect exam&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; unfortunately, I couldn't carry on and needed to drop in the middle as I didn't have any time to progress further with exams, but taking this course was the best decision for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The instructor Stephane Maarek is a well-known Cloud experts and also awarded as AWS Hero which is quite right given their extensive experience and in-depth knowledge of AWS Cloud. He also hold most of the AWS cloud certification you can think of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also the &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/05/top-5-courses-to-crack-aws-solutions-architect-associate-certification-exam-SAA-C01.html#axzz5sc8WyVHT"&gt;best course to pass the AWS Solutions Architect - Associate Exam&lt;/a&gt;, but it also teaches you a lot of small details about cloud computing with AWS. You learn how the services you use on a daily basis on aws cloud works like S3, IAM, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking about the social proof, this course has, on average, 4.5 ratings from 132,775 ratings and 417,354 students enrolled, which is massive by any stretch of the imagination. No doubt that this course is the best-seller on &lt;a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/01/top-10-udemy-courses-for-java-and-web-developers.html"&gt;Udemy&lt;/a&gt;, and most of the AWS-certified people I have met have taken this course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=CuIbQrBnhiw&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Faws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02%2F"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ysbZrmG3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61estRxJrVL._SL1500_.jpg" alt="best Udemy (AWS) | Ultimate AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate course | Video Course : Amazon.in: Software" width="880" height="880"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, if you are preparing for &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/05/top-5-amazon-web-services-aws-courses-for-beginners-and-experienced-programmers.html#axzz6NSsyt5xB"&gt;AWS certification&lt;/a&gt;, then this course is a must, but even if you are learning Cloud Computing, take this course to learn from these knowledgeable Cloud experts.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;That's all about some of the &lt;strong&gt;best online courses to learn Cloud Computing&lt;/strong&gt;. There is no better time to learn Cloud computing than today, and I recommend every programmer learn and get familiar with Cloud computing because no matter what you are doing, your job will be affected by clouds. If you don't pay attention now, you will be left behind in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing about public cloud platforms like &lt;a href=""&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/07/top-5-google-cloud-platform-gcp-courses-certifications-online.html"&gt;GCP&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/07/top-5-courses-to-crack-azure-architecture-technologies-certification-az-300-exam.html"&gt;Microsoft Azure&lt;/a&gt; will also help you get a job quickly as more and companies are looking for professionals who can operate on these public clouds. In other words, Cloud Computing is a handy skill for IT professionals, and you should pay attention to it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I Wrote a Script to Download Every NFT</title>
      <author>Eric Murphy</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 10:54:25 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/ericmurphyxyz/i-wrote-a-script-to-download-every-nft-5fgl</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;By now, you might have learned how to right click and save or screenshot NFTs. But compared to what I'll show you in this post, that'll just look like petty theft. I'm going to show you how to create a script to download &lt;strong&gt;tens of thousands&lt;/strong&gt; of NFTs in just &lt;strong&gt;minutes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memes aside, I thought this was a fun project to get more familiar with Node.js and Puppeteer, a library you can use for web scraping and more. And if that sounds interesting, read on. If you want to follow along better, &lt;a href="https://github.com/ericmurphyxyz/nftgrabber"&gt;here's the GitHub&lt;/a&gt; with the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If you'd like to watch this post in video format, &lt;a href="//youtube.com/watch?v=5fBSWSMGNXM"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#casing-the-joint"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Casing the Joint
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're going to be lifting the NFTs from &lt;a href="https://rarible.com/"&gt;Rarible&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most popular NFT marketplaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YHIABeT9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/v4f7o24opqq9punsq5tj.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YHIABeT9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/v4f7o24opqq9punsq5tj.png" alt="Rarible Marketplace" width="880" height="431"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here you can buy JPEG images of monkies, anime girls, cats, and more. But what we're after are the monkies. Some of the most sought-after NFTs. But I don't want to just save one or two of them--I want ALL of them. To be more precise, all 9,800 of them in &lt;a href="https://rarible.com/boredapeyachtclub"&gt;this collection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4YeFas25--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1ya49zb8t52qg9e6fg3a.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4YeFas25--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1ya49zb8t52qg9e6fg3a.png" alt="Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT Collection" width="880" height="426"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installing-dependencies"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installing Dependencies
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm going to be writing this script in Node.js because I never learned a real programming language. And we're going to be using a library called Puppeteer in order to lift the NFTs. What Puppeteer does is basically starts up a remote-controlled version of Chromium that we can program to do our bidding. Let's initialize the project and install Puppeteer.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm init &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-y&lt;/span&gt;
npm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;puppeteer
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#writing-the-script"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Writing the Script
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's create our script. I've created a file called &lt;code&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt; and added the following:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;puppeteer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;puppeteer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;https://rarible.com/boredapeyachtclub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Loading...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;browser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;puppeteer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;launch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;headless&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;browser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;newPage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;goto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setViewport&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;800&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's explain what's going on here. First, we're importing Puppeteer and a couple of Node.js libraries that will allow us to save files to our local machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we're setting the URL of the page that we're going to be lifting the images from. This can be any Rarible collection page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we're starting the browser with Puppeteer, navigating to the URL, and setting the viewport dimensions. The &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt; keywords will ensure that the previous command will finish before the next one runs. This is all from the Puppeteer documentation, so it's not rocket science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is all correct, then when we run the script with &lt;code&gt;node index.js&lt;/code&gt;, it should open up a Chromium window and navigate to the URL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3dIt3DM---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/627mfjsn80b3z6kj7vrz.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3dIt3DM---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/627mfjsn80b3z6kj7vrz.png" alt="Chromium Window" width="880" height="625"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks good so far. But there's more that needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#getting-the-name-of-the-collection"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Getting the Name of the Collection
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to grab the name of the collection that we're downloading and create a folder to deposit all of our loot into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can get the name from the page title. However, it doesn't load in the name of the collection until the entire page has been loaded. So, we have to wait until the React app has been completely loaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I opened up the devtools and found a class name that we can hook onto. There's a div with the class of &lt;code&gt;ReactVirtualized__Grid&lt;/code&gt; that is the grid that holds all the images. Once that's loaded, the name of the collection has already been loaded in the page title. All we need to do is wait for this element to load, then we can proceed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;waitForSelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.ReactVirtualized__Grid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pageTitle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;collection&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pageTitle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;trim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;existsSync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;mkdirSync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We're using the Puppeteer method &lt;code&gt;waitForSelector&lt;/code&gt; to hold off until this element is loaded. After that, we grab the page title, do a bit of JavaScript string manipulation to get the right value, and finally create the directory with Node (if it hasn't already been created).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now have a folder to put all the images in! Let's fill it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#downloading-the-images"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Downloading the Images
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the meat of the script. What we want to do is get all the resources that are downloaded to the page. That includes HTML, CSS, JS, and images. We only want the images, but only the NFTs, not any logos, avatars, or other images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--oInu8lZq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/myayusu0mxmfuvkbvmqa.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--oInu8lZq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/myayusu0mxmfuvkbvmqa.png" alt="Network Tab of dev tools with Resources" width="772" height="478"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look in the network tab of the dev tools, we can see all the images being loaded. We can also see that all of the NFTs are loaded in with a path containing &lt;code&gt;t_preview&lt;/code&gt;. None of the other images on this page are from the same path. So, if we sort out these images with these URLs, we can single out the NFTs from all the noise.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentImage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;imageUrl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resourceType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;buffer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;imageUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;includes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;t_preview&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fileName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;imageUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;pop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.avif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;filePath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;__dirname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fileName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;writeStream&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createWriteStream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;filePath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;writeStream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; #&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentImage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; saved to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fileName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentImage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There's a lot going on here, but we're getting all the resources, selecting the images, then only getting the ones we want. After that, we use some string manipulation to get the filename and save them as AVIF files (a next-gen image format you can learn more about &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eGN_94zbKo"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Then we're saving these to the new folder we created with some Node.js methods. Finally, we're just logging to console the image that's just been downloaded and how many images have already been downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phew! That works, and we're finally downloading some images. But the images are being lazy-loaded. That means they aren't being loaded until you actually scroll down the page. That's great from a user perspective, as the users are only loading in images they can actually see, but not so much from ours. Let's make an function to scroll down the page for us, and click the "Load more" button that keeps you from seeing all the images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-autoscroller"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Autoscroller
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to start scrolling, we just want to run some JavaScript on the page to scroll it. We can do that with Puppeteer's &lt;code&gt;evaluate&lt;/code&gt; method. This will run some JavaScript on the page, same as if you had written it in the dev tools console.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;autoScroll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;evaluate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;totalHeight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;distance&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;timer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;scrollHeight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;scrollHeight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;scrollBy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;distance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;totalHeight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;distance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;totalHeight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;scrollHeight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;clearInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;timer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What this does is jumps down on the page 500 pixels, and sets a timer to do it again every second. We're scrolling by 500px/second.  A little slow, but if I make it faster it could scroll too fast and skip saving some images. Not good. Then, with &lt;code&gt;totalHeight&lt;/code&gt;, we're saving how much distance we've scrolled already and comparing it to the total height of the page, &lt;code&gt;scrollHeight&lt;/code&gt;. Once we're at the bottom, we're going to stop the &lt;code&gt;setInterval&lt;/code&gt; and resolve the promise. No more scrolling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, once we're at the bottom, we still need to click the "Load more" button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to tell Puppeteer to run some JavaScript on the page to find all the buttons and narrow it down to the button with the text "Load more". There's no unique ID or class on this button, so we have to find it like this. Finally, we click on the button with help from Puppeteer. &lt;em&gt;Finally finally&lt;/em&gt;, we resume the autoscroll function now that there are no more buttons to click.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;autoScroll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;evaluate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;elements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelectorAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)];&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;targetElement&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;elements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;includes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Load more&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;targetElement&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;targetElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;autoScroll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After &lt;em&gt;all that&lt;/em&gt;, we can close the browser once we've gotten to the bottom of this page containing 10,000 NFTs.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;browser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#running-the-script"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Running the Script
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it! We can now run the script and see if it works.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;node index.js
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Actually, this will take a while because we have to scroll down and save &lt;strong&gt;10,000 images&lt;/strong&gt;. Grab a cup of coffee or something and stretch your legs while you're waiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All right, we're back. Let's take a look at what we have here...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yMdbkw3v--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6k5ptbir7axzy38cbn20.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yMdbkw3v--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6k5ptbir7axzy38cbn20.png" alt="A folder full of saved NFTs" width="880" height="508"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a haul! We now have millions of dollars worth of NFTs on our computer. Not bad for a day's work. What am I going to do with all of these monkey pictures??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/ericmurphyxyz/nftgrabber"&gt;I've put the code on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; if you want to pull an NFT heist like me--or just play around with Puppeteer some more. It's pretty fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's all for now. I think I'm just going to be sitting over here counting my fat stacks of NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sending Web Analytics the better way!!</title>
      <author>Abhishek Raj</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 10:23:17 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/abhishekraj272/sending-web-analytics-the-better-way-1c1</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/abhishekraj272/sending-web-analytics-the-better-way-1c1</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most of the big companies have there own analytics rather than using third party services like Google Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have seen many of the sites using &lt;strong&gt;fetch API&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;XHRHttpReq&lt;/strong&gt; for sending analytics event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#whats-the-issue-in-using-that-fetch-apixhr-for-sending-analytics-event"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What's the issue in using that fetch API/XHR for sending analytics event?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even if its async, we are using our main thread to send the events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the send analytics request is queued and user closes the page, your analytics is lost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poor UX due to slow HTTP Requests, if we put analytics send req on document

&lt;code&gt;unload&lt;/code&gt;

event&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/07/logging-activity-web-beacon-api/#can-t-we-already-do-this"&gt;Read More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-should-we-do"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What should we do?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost all browser's (except IE) gives an API for this use case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#beacon-api"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Beacon API
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Beacon API is used to send an asynchronous and non-blocking request to a web server. The request does not expect a response. Unlike requests made using XMLHttpRequest or the Fetch API, the browser guarantees to initiate beacon requests before the page is unloaded and to run them to completion. - &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Beacon_API"&gt;MDN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-is-beacon-api-good-for-sending-analytics-event"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why is Beacon API good for sending analytics event?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It doesn't block your thread.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browser queues it and takes care to sending the request.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even after queuing the page is closed, the request will be sent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It doesn't takes response from server, sends and forgets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supported by most of the browsers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/sendBeacon#browser_compatibility"&gt;Browser Compatability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#caveats"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Caveats
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It only sends POST request.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can't check if request is received by server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>How I passed the AWS Machine Learning Specialty certification</title>
      <author>Florian Clanet</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 10:18:01 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/aws-builders/how-i-passed-the-aws-machine-learning-specialty-certification-3i8</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/aws-builders/how-i-passed-the-aws-machine-learning-specialty-certification-3i8</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-the-hell-did-i-end-up-in-the-exam-room"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How the hell did I end up in the exam room?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, machine learning meant nothing to me and Artificial Intelligence was just some hyped word with disparate college memories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, my interest was growing as I was reading more and more interesting articles on these topics.&lt;br&gt;
One day I found out AWS was releasing a small course on Coursera about Machine Learning:  &lt;a href="https://coursera.org/learn/aws-machine-learning"&gt;Getting started with AWS Machine Learning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched the videos, enjoyed the examples and passed the Quizz. I needed more material, my curiosity was growing and I wanted to practise, diving into the machine learning ocean and discover how interesting the fishing could be!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some days later, I enrolled into &lt;a href="https://fr.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning"&gt;the Standford ML course&lt;/a&gt; by Andrew Ng where I learned so much about theory but also some examples and practical use cases: everything to be able to be autonomous in my future learnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that point, I started to think about going after the AWS Machine Learning Specialty exam.&lt;br&gt;
Following &lt;a href="https://blog.flolight.dev/use-wish-lists-and-certifications-to-extend-your-knowledge"&gt;the same principle as for my Architect certification&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted to use the "exam goal" to explore even more about machine learning, the tools and the best practices used in the professional environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here I am, a few months later, babbling about this exciting experience!&lt;br&gt;
I want to share part of this feeling with you, describing my own journey and hoping for you to enjoy it as much as I did!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#whats-on-the-menu"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What's on the menu?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ucHiMpm4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639648027362/II_MIQ9YL.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ucHiMpm4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639648027362/II_MIQ9YL.jpeg" alt="Menu.jpg" width="880" height="1320"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to do when starting such a journey is to find a map. You wouldn't go to the Amazon forest without one, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your case, you want to go to the &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-machine-learning-specialty/"&gt;Machine Learning Specialty page&lt;/a&gt; and check in particular the exam guide.&lt;br&gt;
This simple page will help you understand how the evaluation is performed and what are the needed skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's hear the master voice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exam validates a candidate’s ability to design, build, deploy, optimize, train, tune, and maintain ML solutions for given business problems by using the AWS Cloud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the practical way!&lt;br&gt;
In November 2021, the assessed skills were spread like the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20% - Data Engineering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This domain includes everything related to data ingestion, transformation and storage.&lt;br&gt;
Data is your main asset in this journey, you want to treat it well and build a nice and genuine friendship!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some services/topics you should explore: Glue, Kinesis, S3, Spark...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;24% - Exploratory Data Analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we are talking about data preparation for modelling, feature engineering and data analysis (understand and visualize).&lt;br&gt;
This is the part where your AWS skills are not going to help you a lot and where you should develop your data-science and analytics knowledge. Improve your relation with data by adding some analytics friends and you should be good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explore some notions like: data cleansing methods, feature reduction, learn to choose visualizations...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;36% - Modelling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This domain will check your abilities to transform a business problem into a machine learning one (or not if it is not needed!).&lt;br&gt;
You will need to learn how to choose the proper model, how to train it, how to optimize hyperparameters, and of course, how to evaluate the performance of your model.&lt;br&gt;
This is a very important part of the exam and it covers a broad range of topics.&lt;br&gt;
To carry on with our metaphor, this is the moment you ask your data some context, some help to be able to provide the best means of transport to the target destination...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should definitely get some real-world experience (projects or use cases examples) to help you analyse the situations and take the right decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20% - Machine Learning Implementations and Operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know how to get and store the data, prepare and analyse it and choose the right method to use for the use case. Nice!&lt;br&gt;
But how will you actually build your solution in order to provide and optimize the business value?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This last domain is focused on choosing the right services to provide the right amount of performance, availability, scalability, resilience and fault tolerance.&lt;br&gt;
It includes also the strategies to deploy the model in production and a bunch of security best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time to have fun ! You did everything right until now, it's time to show that you know how to make use of all this work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is almost the end of the road: deploy the model to production, monitor it, adapt it, maintain it. Make it work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good program isn't it?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, considering the large perimeter of the exam, remember that in order to pass, you will need to have a good knowledge and experience about machine learning but also about AWS services.&lt;br&gt;
On the other hand, don't be scared, the journey is at least as enjoyable as the congrats email when you pass and you will soon be able to navigate between all the AWS ML services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more practical information before we really start the journey, the exam is 180 minutes long and will cost you 300USD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, let's see now how you can organize your learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sagemaker-my-love"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Sagemaker my love 🥰
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Bcxj7ozR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639644256283/XTS1Qg3hf.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Bcxj7ozR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639644256283/XTS1Qg3hf.jpeg" alt="sagemaker-logo.jpeg" width="724" height="362"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before talking about my recent love story (is it a bit early for that?!), I would say that a good start for this certification is the &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/training/learning-paths/machine-learning/exam-preparation/?nc1=h_ls"&gt;AWS Machine Learning path&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weither you are an beginner or the absolute expert, it will give you a large overview of the exam and will build the needed foundations to organize your learning depending on your strengths and weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let's come back to my (and probably your) future true love during this journey:&lt;br&gt;
Amazon Sagemaker!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A proud wizard once told me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the Sagemaker documentation... a lot! ~ A proud wizard, once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should clearly become your main source of truth.&lt;br&gt;
Start by... the getting started! Navigate through the sections and take notes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn all about the built-in algorithms and the way you can fine-tune them using hyperparameters.&lt;br&gt;
How to choose and set the objectives? Which data source can be plugged? What is the best way to deploy? How to secure Sagemaker notebooks...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list of question to clarify is very large at the beginning but don't feel overwhelmed. Just start somewhere and the rest will follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#courses"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Courses
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beside the official documentation, you will want to follow a specific course to guide you through the exam. Here are some I found interesting during my learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used them as a starting point from which I could easily explore in detail the complex notions I didn't get at first sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://learn.acloud.guru/course/aws-certified-machine-learning-specialty/overview"&gt;A Cloud Guru course&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://cloudacademy.com/training-plan/machine-learning-engineer-role-aws-1e79c5a2-890e-4819-9014-dde8c5721101/"&gt;Cloud Academy path&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-machine-learning/"&gt;Udemy course&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#some-videos-to-watch"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Some videos to watch
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aws-power-hour-machine-learning-serie"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AWS Power Hour Machine Learning serie
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is your call to get some more real-life use cases.&lt;br&gt;
As it can be hard to tackle every topic of the exam on your daily job or side projects, this is the way to get some experience from real projects (isn't transfer learning one of the topic to master?!).&lt;br&gt;
Here is a sample of what you'll be able to learn in the &lt;a href="https://pages.awscloud.com/global-traincert-twitch-power-hour-machine-learning.html?Languages=French"&gt;AWS Power Hour Machine Learning serie&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Textract&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comprehend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CodeGuru&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kendra&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personalize&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#reinvent-sessions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  re:Invent sessions
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is true for one and every AWS certification but re:Invent sessions can be very informative to dive into some specific AWS tools and I particular Sagemaker capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some sessions I found useful:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5m4-xWtCU"&gt;Amazon SageMaker deep dive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kou1gQmSmCU"&gt;Introducing Amazon SageMaker Studio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzwkLV9gDXk"&gt;Amazon SageMaker for Fraud Detection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kJf0Lvzj8A"&gt;Building, Training and Deploying Custom Algorithms Such as Fast.ai with Amazon SageMaker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#julien-simons-book"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Julien Simon's Book
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WqOI2jSL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639644851471/HD0hKlB00t.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WqOI2jSL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639644851471/HD0hKlB00t.jpeg" alt="JulienSimonnBook.jpg" width="880" height="1085"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I could not close this article without talking about the great book &lt;a href="https://www.packtpub.com/product/learn-amazon-sagemaker-second-edition/9781801817950"&gt;Learn Amazon SageMaker&lt;/a&gt; by Julien Simon.&lt;br&gt;
It guides you through the full Amazon Sagemaker process by providing some implementation examples and challenges. It covers every aspect of a professional machine learning project and elaborate about good practices and tips to help you navigate when moving your models to the next level, to the production environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Definitely a must read for this exam and for your next challenges in professional environments!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#finishing-straight-readiness-and-the-practise-tests"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Finishing straight: readiness and the practise tests
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here you are, with all this courses and videos in your head. You did some hands-on labs and you learned about some real world use cases.&lt;br&gt;
But I know you don't feel so confident yet... And that's normal!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/external/view/elearning/27/exam-readiness-aws-certified-machine-learning-specialty"&gt;AWS exam readiness course&lt;/a&gt; will help you identify some of the remaining topics you need to deepen.&lt;br&gt;
It gives an overview of all topics for the exam without taking to much time... worth it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next step is for sure to check the available practise tests. They are even more important for this exam than for other certifications: you need to learn how to read, understand and tackle the questions.&lt;br&gt;
You will face long and complex question during more or less 3 hours, you better feel prepared and used to the format!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-ml/AWS%20Certified%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Specialty_Sample%20Questions.pdf"&gt;AWS Sample Exam Questions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/external/view/elearning/9153/aws-certification-official-practice-question-sets-english"&gt;AWS Practise exam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1454809&amp;amp;u=2646034&amp;amp;m=43514&amp;amp;urllink=&amp;amp;afftrack="&gt;Whizlabs tests&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(affiliate link)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://acloudguru.com/course/aws-certified-machine-learning-specialty"&gt;A Cloud Guru course final practise test&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-machine-learning-a-complete-guide-with-python/"&gt;Udemy practise test&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are really very few of quick questions you could find at the associate level.&lt;br&gt;
Most of the questions are in fact some real life use cases with 5 to 15 lines to read before even looking at the questions. This needs a little bit of training to stay focused and know what information to extract from the question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To complete your learning material, I also found these resources useful:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://trello.com/b/Sx6lJzy8/aws-ml-speciality-exam"&gt;This Trello board&lt;/a&gt; by @&lt;a href="https://dev.to@kushbhatnagar86"&gt;Kush Bhatnagar&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ai-SkQV9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639648133926/wpkCE0mH_.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ai-SkQV9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639648133926/wpkCE0mH_.jpeg" alt="Course.jpg" width="880" height="576"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-exam-is-a-little-marathon-not-a-sprint"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The exam is a little marathon not a sprint
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you are almost ready. Let's take some time to reflect on the exam itself and how to think about it to get the best chances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before the exam&lt;/strong&gt;, try to get a good night sleep and relax as much as you can. The exam is going to last 3 hours and you don't want to feel overwhelmed right after the beginning!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;During the exam&lt;/strong&gt;, take the time to read question and create a virtual representation of the problem in your head. This is the key to make sure you understood the problem well enough to think about a solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of questions will propose you several valid answers, you'll need to take note of all critical requirements (cost, simplicity, efficiency, liability, real-time...) to find the best answers.&lt;br&gt;
Don't panic if you feel like some questions are really hard to answer: sometimes AWS team include some slightly out of scope questions to explore future question ideas or to assess the common knowledge about some recently launched services. These questions won't be part of your rating but you will not know which ones they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, I almost forgot the last task before the exam: you need to &lt;a href="https://www.aws.training/certification?banner=mlexam"&gt;schedule the exam&lt;/a&gt; with Pearson Vue or PSI, on-site or from home, select your preferred language... This won't be the hardest part of the journey but don't be afraid to book your exam and set a deadline for your last learning sessions. You will never be ready if you listen to yourself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just go for it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--I2lmdEXO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639648641367/bfjmboF7X.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--I2lmdEXO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639648641367/bfjmboF7X.png" alt="aws-certified-machine-learning-specialty-150x150px.png" width="150" height="150"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it already time to conclude? Hum... so what can we say?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is hard. Hard but not impossible!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned a lot in the process and I would definitely recommand to pursue this certification path if you are interested in machine learning.&lt;br&gt;
It will give you some practise and material to deepen your knowledge (even if you don't want to take the exam).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a good dose of preparation, you will get the possibility to become officially part of the AWS ML family and to get opportunities in one of the most demanded field of at least the 5 next years!&lt;br&gt;
Isn't this interesting?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exam is also really complete and will ask you to practice and learn about real uses cases. You are not protected from having some fun along the way, during your learning...&lt;br&gt;
As always, I hope I managed to share some of my feelings with you and that you are ready to start this awesome learning journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish you good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to reach me on Twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FlolightC"&gt;FlolightC&lt;/a&gt; to keep me updated about your AWS machine learning journey or to ask me questions ! I’m always happy to discuss with you!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why should Python programming to students be taught through lectures/education websites?</title>
      <author>Ethan Taylor</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 10:08:48 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/ethantaylordeveloper/why-should-python-programming-to-students-be-taught-through-lectureseducation-websites-3blh</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whenever we talk about programming, we usually think of the back-end aspect of programming. The codes, the working, the development, and the database. We forget that learning and teaching Python can be an alternative career option after studying python. Python is a language with easy syntax making it easier for beginners to learn to code. Students can learn Python at the school level. This will give them sufficient time to learn and imbibe the concepts of Python. Understanding coding at such a young age will also build the logical skills of the students. Python is taught not just in schools but some Universities have included Python in their curriculum. Python programming is popular among developers because by changing the code base, one can experiment with the program. Freelancing is not only offered at the corporate level but also at an educational level. You can join various companies as a Python coding instructor helping the students learn the concepts of Python programming. Online lectures, developing sample programs, and databases and providing resource material would be your tasks. One of the best freelancing options after studying Python is working as a member of various websites solving the queries of the people. Here, the Python community ranges from beginners to experts. There will be timely help in the work of some user that plays a major role in working on his desired project. If this did not exist, one would have stuck on a particular problem for many days. Thus Python is in high demand nowadays. Eliana is a freelancing website and the content it writes is related to their industries. It brings the companies and the freelancers face to face. The freelancers are exposed to the company they can work for and the company also is provided with a workforce. Eliana provides an opportunity for freelancers to work, gain experience and earn. If you are looking for a company to work for, Eliana is perfect for you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Enable smooth typing and cursor animation in VSCode</title>
      <author>Trishiraj</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 09:36:49 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/trishiraj/enable-smooth-typing-and-cursor-animation-in-vscode-318d</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/trishiraj/enable-smooth-typing-and-cursor-animation-in-vscode-318d</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not sure how many are aware of this, but i believe this kinda motivates you towards typing your codes all day long. Watching those lines of codes flow like butter along with your cursor is just another satisfying thing to watch for any programmer like the satisfying sounds of their mechanical keyboards. 😌&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in this article, I am just dropping a screenshot of my Cursor settings from VScode which you can apply and play around to see what suits you best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can be accessed by using &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ctrl/Cmd + P &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type "&amp;gt; User Settings"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search for "cursor"
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--U2Ltm7G4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u3nuljedeg3nx41s69hf.png" alt="Cursor settings screenshot" width="880" height="714"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy coding! 😄&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Intro&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial we will create a simple API with NodeJs and ExpressJS,&lt;br&gt;
connect to MongoDB and perform CRUD operations with the API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-by-step-process"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Step by Step Process&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a NodeJs project in a new folder by running the command:
&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;npm init -y&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install the following packages in the project by running the command:
&amp;gt;    &lt;code&gt;npm install express mongoose dotenv cors nodemon&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new file in your project folder with the name &lt;code&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inside &lt;code&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt; file, create a simple server with ExpressJS
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
   &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//index.js&lt;/span&gt;

   &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// import the packages we need&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dotenv&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;dotenv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

   &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// loads the env file content into the process.env&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Use process.env.VARIABLE_NAME to access the value of the variable in our .env file&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dotenv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// create an instance of express&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// store the PORT number from the .env file into a constant variable&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PORT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;PORT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// create an index route to test the server&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;send&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Hello World&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// start the server to listen to incoming request&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// on the specified PORT&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;PORT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Server is up and running 🚀🚀🚀 on PORT: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;PORT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new file in your project folder with the name &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inside &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt;  file, add an environment variable for the &lt;code&gt;PORT&lt;/code&gt; number
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
    PORT=5000

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test the server by running g the command &lt;code&gt;node index.js&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open your browser and type &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:5000/&lt;/code&gt; to make a GET request to your server and see your first response.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you get a "Hello World" response, you have created your first Server that is ready to respond whenever a request comes in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#congratulations"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Congratulations 🎊🎊🎉🎉🥳🥳&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can end here but an API can do more than just response with a "Hello World".&lt;br&gt;
In the next step we will connect to mongoDB Atlas using a connection string and add more routes to  Create, Read, Update &amp;amp; Delete resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#crud-operations"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;CRUD operations&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like how we created the index route on line 13, we will create more routes to handle different requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A request is made with an HTTP verb/method that specifies the type of operation the request wants to perform on the server. Some of the common HTTP methods we will look at in this tutorial are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;POST - used to create a new resource on the server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GET - used to read a resources on the server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PATCH - used to update a resource on the server by &lt;strong&gt;merging&lt;/strong&gt; the existing resource with the incoming data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PUT - used to update a resource on the server by &lt;strong&gt;replacing&lt;/strong&gt; the existing resource with the incoming data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DELETE - used to delete a resource on the server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#connecting-to-mongodb-atlas"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Connecting to MongoDB Atlas&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Search for MongoDB Atlas on the browser and signUp for an account. If you already have an account, then please login.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow the welcome guide to create a new project and build your first database cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note the password you set for your user account on your cluster as you will need it to connect to the Cluster later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please make sure to allow access from every I.P address&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to the network menu on your MongoDB Atlas dashboard, add a new IP address and click on &lt;code&gt;ALLOW ACCESS FROM EVERYWHERE&lt;/code&gt; button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click the CONNECT button on the Overview page. Then select Connect your application from the options.&lt;br&gt;
Finally, make sure NodeJS is selected and the version is 4.0 upwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copy the connection string below and add an environment variable for the &lt;code&gt;MONGO_DB_CON_STRING&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
    PORT=5000

    MONGO_DB_CON_STRING=mongodb+srv://admin:&amp;lt;password&amp;gt;@cluster0.nvren.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&amp;amp;w=majority

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure to replace &amp;lt;password&amp;gt; with the password you choose during the welcome guide process and replace myFirstDatabase in the connection string with a name for your database. You can give it any name&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To connect our API with MongoDB, we will use the mongoose package we installed earlier on. Add this line to your import statements at the top of the index.js file&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mongoose&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;mongoose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since our server depends on the database to handle requests, its essential to attempt a connection to MongoDB Atlas first. If the connection is successfully, we  then start our server to listen to incoming requests on the specified &lt;code&gt;PORT&lt;/code&gt; number.&lt;br&gt;
If the connection fails, we simply log out the error to the console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But feel free to separate the connection to mongoDB from starting the server if your server directly doesn't directly depend on the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replace this part of code:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;   &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// start the server to listen to incoming request&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// on the specified PORT&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;PORT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Server is up and running 🚀🚀🚀 on PORT: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;PORT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;with this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// connect to MongoDBAtlas first&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;mongoose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;MONGO_DB_CON_STRING&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// if we get an error, log it out to the console&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Failed to connect to MongDB &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// if connection is successful... start the server&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;MongoDB is connected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// start the server to listen to incoming request&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// on the specified PORT&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;PORT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Server is up and running 🚀🚀🚀 on PORT: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;PORT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#model-your-data"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Model your data&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MongoDB is a NoSQL database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In comparison to the relational SQL database:&lt;br&gt;
 a &lt;code&gt;TABLE&lt;/code&gt; in SQL is a &lt;code&gt;COLLECTION&lt;/code&gt; in NoSQL,&lt;br&gt;
 a &lt;code&gt;COLUMN&lt;/code&gt; in SQL is a &lt;code&gt;FIELD&lt;/code&gt; in NoSQL,&lt;br&gt;
 and &lt;code&gt;ROW&lt;/code&gt; in SQL is a &lt;code&gt;DOCUMENT&lt;/code&gt; in NoSQL,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meaning, you can structure your document in the Collection any how you want it. To help make storing and retrieving documents, we will create a model to represent how data will be stored and retrieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside your project, create a new folder called &lt;code&gt;models&lt;/code&gt; and inside the &lt;code&gt;models&lt;/code&gt; folder create a new file called &lt;code&gt;todo.js&lt;/code&gt; and paste in the following code snippet.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//import the mongoose package&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mongoose&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;mongoose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// unpack Schema &amp;amp; model from mongoose&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Schema&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mongoose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// the Schema defines the structure of our Collection(Table) in MongoDB&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// the model defines how data will modeled for our collection&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// and comes along with built in features  to manipulate the data&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// create a new Schema instance specifying which&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// fields(columns) we want in our Collection(Table)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;todoSchema&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Schema&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;isCompleted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Boolean&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// then make a model&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// by passing in the name and a schema for our model&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// and export it to be imported used in other files&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Todo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;todo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;todoSchema&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#adding-more-routes-to-perform-crud-operations"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Adding more routes to perform CRUD operations&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside the &lt;code&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt; file, import the Todo model we just created.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// import Todo model to perform crud operations&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Todo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./models/todo.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To extract the body of requests made with &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PUT&lt;/code&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;code&gt;PATCH&lt;/code&gt;, we need to add line this after we created the server instance in &lt;code&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt; file;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// create an instance of express&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// use the json middleware to&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// extract the data stored in the request body&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importing your files like this will crash your Server. To fix it, inside the &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; file, add a comma after the "main": "index.js" line and paste this there.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"main"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"index.js"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"type"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"module"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;"type": "module",&lt;/code&gt; helps us to use the modern import statement. Read more on javascript.info about Modules&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below the index route, add the following code snippets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each snippet is well commented to explain what the code is doing so be sure to read them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The async/await keywords you see simply means our server will keep on listening to more request while it await the results of the asynchronous operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CREATE a todo&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// the data to be saved must be in your request's body in json format &lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Try out your API&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anytime you make a change in the code, you have to stop the server and start it again by running &lt;code&gt;node index.js&lt;/code&gt;. This process of restarting the server can get pretty tiring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We install &lt;code&gt;nodemon&lt;/code&gt; earlier on when we create the project. &lt;code&gt;nodemon&lt;/code&gt; will watching your project and restart the server whenever you save a file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use nodemon, add the &lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;code&gt;start-dev&lt;/code&gt; commands to the &lt;code&gt;scripts&lt;/code&gt; object inside the &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"scripts"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"start"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"node index.js"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"start-dev"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"nodemon index.js"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"test"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"echo &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Error: no test specified&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; exit 1"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Start your server in development mode by running &lt;code&gt;npm run start-dev&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm run start&lt;/code&gt; will be used in production when you publish your server to hosting providers like cyclic.sh or Heroku to start the serve in production mode&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VS Code has an extension called &lt;code&gt;Thunder Client&lt;/code&gt; so you can install it and try making request to your server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure to use the right HTTP verb/methods for your requests and sure you replace &lt;code&gt;:todoID&lt;/code&gt; the &lt;code&gt;_id&lt;/code&gt; of a document  when you are making a &lt;code&gt;PUT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PATCH&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;DELETE&lt;/code&gt; requests.&lt;br&gt;
Also, make sure that for your &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PUT&lt;/code&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;code&gt;PATCH&lt;/code&gt; requests, you add the data to be sent in the body of the request in &lt;code&gt;json&lt;/code&gt; format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;//TODO: Insert screenshot of the using Thunder Client here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#publish-your-api"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Publish your API&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use the API you have just created in your mobile and web apps, you need to publish the server to a hosting provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cyclic.sh is a free hosting provider that makes deploying your NodeJS projects as easy as pushing the codes to GitHub. I highly recommend that you try it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pushing-your-codes-to-github"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Pushing your codes to GitHub&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GitHub is the Google Drive or DropBox for developers. Its an remote store where you can keep your projects that and share your code with others. You can continue working on any other computer just by going to GitHub and cloning the project to the computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow these steps to publish your codes to GitHub from this &lt;a href=""&gt;amazing article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#deploying-with-cyclicsh"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Deploying with cyclic.sh&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you have pushed your codes to GitHub, signUp for an account on cyclic.sh. You can use your GitHub account to signUp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a new app and link it to your GitHub repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add your MONGO_DB_CON_STRING environment variable you used in the &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file in the Environment Secrets section and done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anytime you push your code to GitHub, cyclic.sh will deploy your server and give you a url to access your server. This is known as Continuos Deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cyclic.sh will generate a random unique url for your server. Use this url instead of &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:5000&lt;/code&gt; when you are making requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow this article for a detailed guide to &lt;a href="https://dev.to/_iametornam/deploy-your-nodejs-auth0-rest-api-to-cyclicsh-under-4-minutes-j8h"&gt;deploying your API on cyclic.sh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ProTip: Anything can go wrong when a server receives a request. It is recommended that you always wrap your codes in a try/catch block to handle the errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any issues, please write them in the comments section below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can follow me on &lt;a href=""&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; for more juicy contents daily. Find me on &lt;a href=""&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and browse through the source code for this project on &lt;a href=""&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's all folks!!!.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mentorship in Tech: Useful Tips For Mentors and Mentees</title>
      <author>Vectorly</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 09:04:30 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/vectorly/mentorship-in-tech-useful-tips-for-mentors-and-mentees-2m17</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/vectorly/mentorship-in-tech-useful-tips-for-mentors-and-mentees-2m17</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The story was originally posted on &lt;a href="https://www.vectorly.team/vectorly-blog/mentorship-in-tech"&gt;Vectorly blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the &lt;a href="https://joshbersin.com/2021/09/ten-new-truths-about-the-hr-technology-market/"&gt;key trends&lt;/a&gt; in engineering management is the transition from traditional practices to the development and training of employees within the company. Leading enterprises are already investing huge amounts of resources in talent development, as they understand that this is one of the crucial growth factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, skills become obsolete and companies must constantly review their employees and motivate them to develop professionally. Companies also need to make sure their employees’ skills match the needs of the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is: how can an engineering manager develop their team effectively? Answer: one of the tools for professional development in tech companies is mentorship programs. The value of this tool is that mentorship is useful both for developers looking for mentors and for the mentors themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, software developers who are willing to grow their skills will find information on why they need a mentor and how to find one. While more experienced engineers will understand how to become a great mentor and how mentorship can help them too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-mentorship"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is mentorship?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mentorship is a relationship between two people, in which a person with more experience, knowledge, and connections (a mentor) can transfer what they have learned to a less experienced specialist (a mentee) in a particular field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The activities of a mentor are aimed at maximizing the personal and professional potential of the mentee. However, it is important to note that mentoring is not focused on a person's problems, but is aimed at developing and teaching, so that a junior specialist can solve their problems and face challenges on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideal mentoring is a two-way road, where both the mentor and the mentee benefit. Although at first glance, it seems that the mentee gets the main benefit — this is only one side of the coin. By helping a junior employee become better, the mentor not only gains the satisfaction of helping and developing someone, but also achieves success in management and takes their career to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ebUHK4-6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b1a1adroloykoa5z6kc0.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ebUHK4-6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b1a1adroloykoa5z6kc0.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="1280"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  Useful tips for mentees
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's worth taking the time for software developers to find a good mentor, because it's one of the best ways to accelerate your professional growth. We will tell you more about what goals you should strive for with a mentor and how to find a suitable mentor for yourself in this section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-do-developers-need-a-mentor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why do developers need a mentor?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The skills of knowledge workers, especially software engineers, become obsolete very quickly, which is why developers need to constantly level-up and learn. An experienced mentor can help you with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good mentor will not only help you see growth points in your development, but also how to stay on top of the latest industry trends, join a community of like-minded people and build a development plan with appropriate learning activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does a software developer benefit from mentorship? Let's find out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn about best practices and tools.&lt;/strong&gt; Your mentor can teach you advanced programming techniques. Of course, it is useful to gain general knowledge about universal tools for a developer: programming languages, frameworks, etc. But it is especially helpful to learn how to tailor your programming skills to the needs of a particular team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find a better solution to a challenging problem.&lt;/strong&gt; If you can't cope with a difficult task, the mentor can give a broader view of the problem and suggest a different angle or faster solutions. It is important to understand that, if the mentor solves the problem for you, this is the wrong way to go about it. It is better if the mentor can competently suggest which books, courses, and other resources can be studied on this topic. This will help you deal with difficult tasks on your own in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identify areas of growth.&lt;/strong&gt; The mentor can honestly point out areas where you need to work on improving. It is absolutely normal that we do not notice our weaknesses, because it is human nature to avoid difficult tasks. And working on your weaknesses is one of the most difficult tasks that can stand in the way of achieving high results in your career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Career development advice.&lt;/strong&gt; A mentor can help you find the area of ​​development that suits you best and that you like. Help from a senior colleague will make your career path easier and help you avoid mistakes. Perhaps thanks to the timely advice of a mentor, you can create a career path and achieve your goals more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support during remote work.&lt;/strong&gt; How can you gain a rewarding experience when you work alone? A mentor will come to the rescue, immerse you in the culture of the company and help you build friendships with colleagues, from whom you can gain experience and with whom you will create successful projects. Remote work will not take you away from reality, if there is a specialist next to you, who is interested in integrating you into the development team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-find-a-mentor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to find a mentor
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding the right mentor is not an easy task. Firstly, he or she must be qualified in the area in which you want to develop; and secondly, you must have a match and the desire to trust your mentor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the ways you can find a mentor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Mentorship programs at the workplace&lt;/strong&gt;
Often, employers organize mentoring programs, where more experienced developers train and mentor junior employees. It is a very good indicator if the company has such programs. This means that the company cares about the development of its employees. Developers should use this opportunity, if the company involves them in such an onboarding process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the company does not offer such programs, developers can ask an experienced colleague to mentor them on a regular basis. However, there are situations when colleagues are not ready to train a young specialist: perhaps there are no resources, they are busy with projects and there are many more reasons. Then you will need to find a mentor outside your company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professional communities in Facebook, Slack, etc&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There are many professional communities, in which developers share knowledge, experience, and information. You can become a member of such a community, take an active part there, follow the specialists you are interested in and ask them for help. Many experienced developers, CTOs, or engineering managers are happy to share their experience and provide advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mentorship platforms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There are also specialized resources, where mentors and mentees can meet. You can find a list of such databases in our &lt;a href="https://www.notion.so/vectorly/12a53f2f059348e79bbf3a6ac18c053d?v=25233e0791a34f93ac82442a46b433ee"&gt;Knowledge Base&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#signs-that-you-and-your-mentor-are-a-good-match"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Signs that you and your mentor are a good match
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you know if your mentor is right for you? We advise you to pay attention to the following signs, which show that you and the mentor will work together well and your cooperation will, indeed, be beneficial for both parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relevant experience. If your mentor has gone through the same career points as you and has already achieved the goals you have in your mind - this person can help you avoid mistakes that he or she faced in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Successful cases and completed challenges in relevant fields. Find out what achievements the mentor had when they started their career in development. If among them there are those that are relevant to your aspirations, the mentor will share their experience and help you achieve what you want faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goal-oriented. A good mentor creates a growth plan, monitors your progress, and clearly tells you what you need to do to get to the next level. The stated goals at the start increase the chances of success at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Available for regular meetings. Observe how responsive your mentor is and whether he or she responds in a timely manner to your problems. Also, in order to achieve the best results, it is important to meet regularly and summarize the outcomes of the iteration or task. Meetings, strategy sessions, and calls show the mentor's interest and involvement in your affairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good listener. Assess the mentor as a person: is he/she listening to your ideas and professional difficulties? Does he/she give feedback? If yes, it will be easy for you to work together for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shows interest in empowering others. The mentor should be interested in your growth and support your intention to take on more tasks or empower you to do so. For example, if at some point you want to not only write code, but also do testing or take on managerial tasks, a good mentor will do their best so that you feel supported in your development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open to flexible mentoring styles. There are a lot of approaches and different styles of mentoring, so the mentor should be ready to find what suits best for your work together and make sure everyone feels comfortable with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready to learn from a mentee. This is one of the most important points, because a person who is ready to admit that he/she does not know something and is ready to learn, can teach this skill to others. You will both feel satisfied if a mentorship session gives you both useful experience and new knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  Useful tips for mentors
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section, we will talk about why it is useful to become a mentor and give advice to those who want to mentor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-are-the-benefits-of-becoming-a-mentor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What are the benefits of becoming a mentor?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideal mentoring is a win-win story, where each side benefits from the interaction. Mentors also get benefits from conducting sessions with young professionals. This is new knowledge, and a new impetus in a career, and an opportunity to influence the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's take a closer look. These are the benefits that mentors can get when they start working with mentees:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next step in their career&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Often, developers who have taken a senior position or become team leads do not see a further career path for themselves. Becoming a mentor is one of the roads a developer can grow into. Mentoring can be perceived as the highest career point, because a person grows from a specialist into an expert and influencer in their field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opportunity to make a contribution to the community&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
With their expertise, a mentor can influence the future of a field of activity that they are passionate about. It is an honor for every developer who truly loves what they do to oversee the transfer of best practices to future generations and to make sure the industry develops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New knowledge from young professionals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Although beginners do not have much experience in development, they have a lot of ideas and think broadly, while their everyday life is not busy with routine tasks. Plus, the mentor develops as a manager, planning and controlling tasks for a young specialist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-become-a-great-mentor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to become a great mentor
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To become a good mentor, you need to adhere to a certain ideology and order of actions in your work. Let's share a few behaviors, which mostly speak for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip #1&lt;/strong&gt;: The best mentor relationships eventually become two-way. Be ready to learn from your mentee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip #2&lt;/strong&gt;: Listen. Put the focus on the other person, his/her needs and difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip #3&lt;/strong&gt;: Guide, don’t control. Mentees must make their own decisions, so direct and support, rather than dictating to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip #4&lt;/strong&gt;: Give specific, actionable advice. Don’t be vague.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip #5&lt;/strong&gt;: Be authentic; practice what you preach. Ask questions that encourage, inspire, and stimulate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip #6&lt;/strong&gt;: Be direct and tell the truth, however hard. Your mentee expects you to be objective and constructive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#toolbox-for-a-great-mentorship"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Toolbox for a great mentorship
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order for the mentoring session to become not just a discussion of problems, but an opportunity to solve specific problems, you need to have at your disposal a set of tools that will help increase efficiency:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skill matrices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These will help a mentor determine what skills are needed for a particular role and what needs to be improved for a person to fit that role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To save time, use the ready-made Vectorly &lt;a href="https://www.vectorly.team/skill-matrix-templates"&gt;skill matrices templates&lt;/a&gt; for 50+ tech roles and adapt them to the roles of your company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what a skill matrix of a Python developer looks like in Vectorly. There is a skillset, which you can change and assess during a review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yeUEfhcL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1h38oa5ihhbrhqwezwr4.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yeUEfhcL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1h38oa5ihhbrhqwezwr4.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="485"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A well-organized review process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mentee skills review will help determine skill gaps and identify what skills a person lacks and what needs to be developed, and determine the area of ​​growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To hold a good skills review, you should understand the main steps of this process. Find more info on how to organize a skill review in our guide - &lt;a href="https://www.vectorly.team/vectorly-blog/software-engineer-performance-review-example"&gt;Software Engineer Performance Review Example&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of a review, a mentor will get a clear picture of the mentee’s current status and create a professional development plan to build the lacking skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fA7NUC_k--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mnpy4whp4ggv2oyzvnpn.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fA7NUC_k--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mnpy4whp4ggv2oyzvnpn.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="494"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Skills review analysis in &lt;a href="https://www.vectorly.team/feature/reviews"&gt;Vectorly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also make the assessment process automated with Vectorly’s &lt;a href="https://www.vectorly.team/feature/reviews"&gt;Reviews&lt;/a&gt;, so you don’t have to worry about how to organize it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1-on-1 meetings and ready-made templates with the agenda&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep the mentorship session structured and effective, the mentor should have a prepared template with a set of questions. Schedule regular meetings on monitoring in the calendar (every 2 weeks) and use a ready-made template. It will save time and keep the right focus during a 1-on-1 meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use Vectorly’s a &lt;a href="https://public.vectorly.team/meeting-template/6172ba09d7b0b60023a3c22a?_gl=1*1w39vr7*_ga*MTEyMjk3NDA3Mi4xNjM3MzI1NDE1*_ga_38XH30XY3T*MTYzOTY0MzY1OC43NC4xLjE2Mzk2NDUyMzcuNjA."&gt;ready-made template&lt;/a&gt; on personal development with a set of questions, from Vectorly’s &lt;a href="https://www.vectorly.team/one-on-one-and-team-meeting-templates"&gt;library&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VjVY03HD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/akzf418iy3u4hrycjey4.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VjVY03HD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/akzf418iy3u4hrycjey4.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="276"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge base&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be hard to quickly find a relevant online course, article or a book for developing specific skills. So, to save time, a mentor might need a ready-made base with resources for skills improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vectorly has created the &lt;a href="https://www.notion.so/vectorly/12a53f2f059348e79bbf3a6ac18c053d?v=25233e0791a34f93ac82442a46b433ee"&gt;Biggest Knowledge Base&lt;/a&gt; to grow tech skills, which a mentor can access and use for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other way to find relevant sources to add to a mentee’s PDP is to use Vectorly’s &lt;a href="https://www.vectorly.team/feature/growth-plans"&gt;Growth Plan&lt;/a&gt;, which automates this process. Vectorly analyzes the working activity of your team members for you and offers specific activities from the knowledge base, integrated with the service. All you need to do is choose between the offered recommendations and add the task to a mentee’s to-do list. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CnSzZ6Bi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oke9thjmr0j4hw2hjqtm.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CnSzZ6Bi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oke9thjmr0j4hw2hjqtm.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="880"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#key-ideas"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Key ideas
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cooperation between the mentor and the mentee is important for both parties. A young specialist develops skills, and a mentor builds up expertise in management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When choosing a mentor, it is important to find a person with whom the match will be successful. This can be determined by the relevance of experience, goals, and similarities of interests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mentor should only direct and support mentees, rather than giving ready-made decisions. Learning to make decisions and move tasks forward is the main goal of mentoring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To make mentorship sessions more effective, a mentor should use special tools like skill matrices, meetings templates, and knowledge bases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>FastWSGI: An ultra-fast WSGI server for Python</title>

  FastWSGI
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been developing a Python extension, written in C, that provides users with an ultra-fast WSGI server that they can run their WSGI applications on (Flask, Django and other WSGI apps).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also recently managed to get it working on multiple platforms (Linux, MacOS and Windows).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to significantly speed up your WSGI based applications, check it out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is still in early development at the moment. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to easily switch between different versions of Nodejs on your system.

      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easily switch between different versions of Nodejs on your system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog article we'll learn how to switch to a default version when using &lt;code&gt;nvm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NVM is a tool that handles what versions of Nodejs you can use. Let’s say one’s working on a cutting edge library that requires the latest version, they would switch/install a version of Nodejs that is compatible with the library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scenario two, one is working on a project that requires an older version of Nodejs, let's say &lt;code&gt;version 8.0.0.&lt;/code&gt; Installing and reinstalling Nodejs becomes hectic and cumbersome. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;nvm&lt;/code&gt; makes handling versions of Nodejs rather painless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NVM, (Node Version Manager) enables one to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install different versions of Nodejs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switch to different versions of Nodejs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set a default Nodejs version from the installed versions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove installed versions of Nodejs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#install-nvm"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Install nvm
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This assumes that &lt;code&gt;nvm&lt;/code&gt; installed already, if not, install &lt;code&gt;nvm&lt;/code&gt; by:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# install script for nvm&lt;/span&gt;
curl &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-o-&lt;/span&gt; https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Note: Curl installation on your system is also required. Curl enables one to make http request from the commandline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After downloading and running the &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt; script, set your profile file &lt;code&gt;~/.bash_profile&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;~/.zshrc&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;~/.profile&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;~/.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; so that nvm is available system-wide.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;export &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;NVM_DIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-z&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;XDG_CONFIG_HOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt; %s &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;HOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/.nvm"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt; %s &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;XDG_CONFIG_HOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/nvm"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$NVM_DIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/nvm.sh"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$NVM_DIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/nvm.sh"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c"&gt;# This loads nvm&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Check if &lt;code&gt;nvm&lt;/code&gt; installed correctly by running:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;nvm &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-v&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;# prints nvm help menu for various options&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/static/img/default-node-version.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="/static/img/default-node-version.png" alt="terminal screenshot showing nvm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#install-a-different-version-of-nodejs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Install a different version of nodejs
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To install a different node version using nvm:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;nvm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;14.0.0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NVM handles the installation of the Nodejs version for you, afterwards , you may use this version when needed or as needed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use the Nodejs version from above:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;nvm use 14.0.0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This command tells NVM to switch Nodejs to this version, the changes apply system-wide which is kinda cool, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#set-a-default-version-of-nodejs-using-nvm"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Set a default version of Nodejs using NVM
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To set a default version of Nodejs using nvm, use this syntax:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;nvm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;alias &lt;/span&gt;defaut &amp;lt;your_nodejs_default_version&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To switch to version we installed above &lt;code&gt;14.0.0&lt;/code&gt;, run:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;nvm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;alias &lt;/span&gt;default 14.0.0
node &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-v&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c"&gt;# prints 14.0.0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;






&lt;p&gt;NVM makes handling nodejs versions on your system rather painless and easy especially if you heavily use Nodejs as a tooling for your frontend work flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NVM offers more options such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;uninstall a Nodejs version&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switch to a Nodejs version, &lt;code&gt;nvm use &amp;lt;nodejs_version&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/notmahnoor/build-your-ui-faster-with-these-free-ui-kits-2fh2</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, as UI designers, it is asked of us to churn out quick and fast, decent UI designs, and the emergence of Tailwind CSS has already made our jobs easy. But it could be much easier if only we could use pre-built components to plug into our code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here it is. I’ve done the hard work so &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; don’t have to. Below is a compiled list of FREE UI Kits to help you achieve the completion of your project within a short time frame.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  7. &lt;a href="https://www.salvia-kit.com/"&gt;Salvia Kit&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
