      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CryptominingApp - Phoneum (PHT) Review and Crypto Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PHT cloud earning or Phoneum is a very straight forward app with attractive app with a lot of functionality such as VIP Miners and as well as regular miners. And unlike other apps you have to click on PHT Cloud Earning app once a week. However hash rate or the speed of mining on this app is little low, but this app is cloud based and its not going to use any computational power from your phone except for little space for app. So, you can use this app, and hey you're doing pretty much nothing, so if it brings some value in future so its worth mining. But I wouldn't say this is a similar to Pi, but its free with legit details. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phoneum is one of the new age mobile only crypto currencies that can be mined only from the mobile phone. The team behind Phoneum is building a community of users who would socialize the Phoneum coin, PHT as it is called. The Phoneum ecosystem has an app (available on iOS and Android) which can be used to mine the PHT coins, then several mobile games that keep users engaged and incentivize them to earn more coins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to mine Phoneum (PHT): -&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Mining of Phoneum (PHT) Coin, you will need its app, you should read this article carefully before downloading the application. We are saying this because you do not face any kind of problem after installing the application. If you will open a cloud application every 7 days and start cloud mining, then we get about 70 PTH coins every week. That is, we get 10 coins every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is one of the easiest things to do. PHT mining is done on the cloud. So, on your phone, similar to the Pi app, you just have to open the app and click on mine. Unlike other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoins (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoins etc, you dont need large infrastructures or big rigs to mine these tokens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to claim for extra reward: -&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reward you get from inviting does not depend on how many coins you will receive; it depends on whom you have invited. How many sessions does he complete? The person you invited completes two sessions, that is, 2 weeks of cloud mining, you will get 400+ PHT Coin Rewards, 5 weeks of Mining Sessions will be available for 1000+ PHT Coin Rewards, and After completing the 10-week mining session, 2000+ PHT Coin Rewards will be available. After this, you will not get any more coins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sign up by using referral code - 4fwf3aun now and get 200 PHT bonus coins.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much Phoneum is available in market: -&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a total of 2 Billion PHT coins in supply. Of this in a given 24hour period, only about a million coins are traded, indicating low liquidity. As of now, the crypto is extensively traded only on the Probit exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have hit mine, the app mines for a total of 7 days and then stops. Then, you need to log in again to make it mine again. So you need to sign into the app every 7 days to claim the previously mined coins and then click mine again to start earning more PHTs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phoneum (PHT) is listed on Exchange: -&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phoneum (PHT) Token is already listed on the Probit Exchange, on February 18, one of its coins is priced at $ 0.0002824, which is 0.01997 in Indian Rupees. Right now, you must be looking at this price, but just as the price of 1 bitcoin was $ 0.08 in the year 2008, similarly its price is so low in today’s time. In the coming times, Phoneum (PHT) can make a good price in the Token market, so you should start collecting it from today. Right now, talking about the price of Phoneum (PHT) Coin, the price of one coin is $ 0.0002824, which is 0.01997 in Indian rupees. It is true that this application is very slow, that is, the value of the coin mined by this application is very low. But the price of a coin reaches $ 1 in the coming years, so you can understand how much profit you are going to make. Now make sure that you have to do Phoneum (PHT) Token mining or not? Below is the link, on which you can earn a 200 PHT coin bonus by clicking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why you need Phoneum (PHT) code-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you planning to mining on Phoneum (PHT) for free to generate some PHT coins, so you need invitation from an existing trusted member of Phoneum (PHT), so if you have an invitation you can download the mobile app and start mining or you can use my invitation code to mine on Network, because to get better mining speed you should make sure that your circle is full of active people like I am. With the active circle you will get better mining rate as well as members in your circle will also get better mining rate because of your activity, so make sure to choose someone who is active (can click on an app at-least ones in 7 day).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is Alpha Network Legit? for Cryptomining </title>
      <author>Rishi</author>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CryptominingApp - Alpha Network Review and Crypto Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alpha coins are very reliable and 100% legit. I've been trading on the platform since 2018 without any issues. Similar to gaming apps, Alpha network has a direct easy-to-use application where users can sign in using their email or Facebook account, push a button and earn 0.5 coins per hour until the 500 million coin supply is exhausted. The app also has a “boost” feature that allows users to watch 15-second ads to earn extra coins. Users can also increase their mining rate by inviting others to join. With Alpha Network you can earn cryptocurrency from your phone by pressing a button every 24 hours. There are a few ways in which you can increase the amount of Alpha coins you earn per hour. But before we go into that, have a look at their presentation video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, developers added a Loot-Box feature allowing users to open a box with rewards and triple the reward by watching an ad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alpha Network referral code: crypto18&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project Phases in Alpha Network:-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alpha network app was launched in April 2021 for Android devices, and developers aim to expand the scope of the project over 3 phases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;--Launching mining apps for Google play and Apple store, as well as developing a wallet app within 3-6 months&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;--Launching the wallet app and allowing users to perform transactions. Developers also state that following steps are “big and will be revealed at the time”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;--At this phase, the initial mining pool of 500 million coins will be used up as more users join, and the developers will release a physical mining node (PMN) software for PCs and the users will participate in the decision making about the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mining on Alpha Network and Its user-base:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project has been structured in three phases in order to create an easy-to-understand overview of the development plan from the team. Each phase represents a milestone for Alpha Network and can be triggered by a specific event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first phase of the project proposes the launch of the initial Alpha Network miner app which enables players to start contributing to the system by earning alpha coin. This is handled for both Android and iOS devices in a staged manner with an initial release on Android followed by iOS. The phase continues with general improvements to the platform until the Alpha Network Wallet app is ready for the market, which we expect to be anywhere from 3 to 6 months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why you need Alpha Network code-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All you need is an invitation from an existing trusted member on the network. If you have an invitation you can download the mobile app. If you looking for start and need reference codes, so you can use my reference codes because you need a referral code to join most of these networks. When you use someone’s code, they get a better mining rate. Make sure to choose someone who is always active, like I am, as this will improve your own mining rate too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alpha Network referral code: crypto18&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is TimeStope Legit? for Cryptomining </title>
      <author>Rishi</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 20:37:07 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CryptominingApp - Timestope Review and Crypto Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timestope is south Korean project with some background in technology and cryptocurrencies. It seems Timestope is consist of team of a legit people in a company that's already been making apps for some time. There are chances in future their currency will have some better value as they are also running some other dApps from their own platform. It seems Timestope can't be successful as Pi Network, but eventually it will bring some value as mining is free on your phone and you don’t have to pay anything except for clicking on their app once a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is TimeStope Legit?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timestope is a verified Crypto Currency that started free mining on October 7, 2020, Founded by the Korean Community. This Free “Mining” Offered by Timestope is aimed at creating awareness to have many people be in possession of the coins (Crypto Currency) before it’ll be launched and trading will start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Does TimeStope Work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basis of TimeStope is to be a witness. Only those who have been invited by the witness can create the TIME through TimeStope, and 9.6τ is distributed to the inviter every day. When the mining period expires, you must witness for someone other than the inviter who invited you and the person you invited, and the attendance score will be reset. This is a way to consistently provide fair opportunities to new participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timestope, being one of the best cryptocurrencies is promising and most excitingly, it is 100% free Registration and free Mining with or without referral. To start your journey mining Timestope to financial freedom. Timestope app is available on play store or app store. So anyone can download Timestope and earn cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Play Store: - &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.timestope"&gt;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.timestope&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rating on Android: - 4.4 by 44,376&lt;br&gt;
Website: - &lt;a href="https://www.timestope.com/"&gt;https://www.timestope.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Whitepaper: - &lt;a href="https://www.timestope.com/white-paper"&gt;https://www.timestope.com/white-paper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timestope Witness (referral) code: crypto18&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is 100 attendance point?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attendance score is 100 points for initial participation. Attendance must be checked in the attendance book within 24h hours based on UTC. If you check attendance, your attendance score increases by 2 points, and if you do not check attendance, your attendance score decreases by 3 points. Keep in mind that if you are absent for exactly 31 days, that participant will not be able to join in the TimeStope permanently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the attendance score reaches a certain score, the transferable amount per year increases. For example, when the attendance score reaches 300 points, the number of sending per year increases from 10,000τ to 500,000τ, and when it finally reaches 10,000 points, the number of sending per year is infinite and can be transmitted without limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why you need Timestope Witness (referral) code-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have an invitation you can download the mobile app. If you looking for start and need witness (referral) codes, so you can use my referral codes because you need a referral code to join most of these networks. When you use someone’s code, they get a better mining rate. Make sure to choose someone who is always active, like I am, as this will improve your own mining rate too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timestope Witness (referral) code:  crypto18&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How much can you earn on UpWork before you give up?</title>
      <author>Max</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/rimutaka/how-much-can-you-earn-on-upwork-before-you-give-up-3mha</guid>
      <description>&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-brief-analysis-of-actual-upwork-earnings-for-software-developers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A brief analysis of actual UpWork earnings for software developers
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DR; The sooner you give up, the more you earn elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In case you don't know what &lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com"&gt;UpWork&lt;/a&gt; is, it is a leading freelance marketplace. They are a publicly listed company with $338M revenue in 2020. Anyone can post a job there, and most professionals can offer their services at the cost of 20% of their earnings. The platform provides no vetting for employers and minimal vetting for freelancers leaving it to the feedback system to weed out bad players. It is one of the better ones out there.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to hire on UpWork for our startup. It was an easy way to get things done on a shoestring budget. The results were a mixed bag. Most of the work was either a complete throw-away or prototype-level quality.&lt;br&gt;
We got what we paid for, but there were a few outliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#highquality-freelancers-are-outliers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  High-quality freelancers are outliers
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite considering bids only from freelancers with excellent feedback and &lt;a href="https://support.upwork.com/hc/en-us/articles/211068358"&gt;90%+ Job Success Score&lt;/a&gt; our hit rate was about 1 in 10 for "acceptable" and 1 in 20 for "great". We were lucky to hire some really good freelancers from remote (to us) places like Moldova, Macedonia and Turkey. They were up and coming, had reasonable rates and appreciated the constant stream of work we were sending them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#paying-more-doesnt-get-you-more-quality"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Paying more doesn't get you more quality
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seemed to be a pretty low ceiling on the quality of the workforce there. Assuming that our job ads were well-written, simply offering more money didn't bring better quality bids. None of the higher-cost freelancers we tried ended up on our regulars list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#freelancers-lifetime-value"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Freelancer's lifetime value
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently got in touch with 11 out of 13 UpWork freelancers we hired on a regular basis. To my surprise, none of them was still using UpWork or any other freelance marketplace. Only 3 continued with casual contract work mostly through referrals from past clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They all had a different story to tell, but the common theme was that the jobs on UpWork were hard to get, many employers had no idea what they were doing and the pay was below the market rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So how much do freelancers make before they move off the platform?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked at the total earnings of 100 freelancers in &lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/ab/profiles/search/?category_uid=531770282580668418&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;q=rust"&gt;search results for Rust&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pWtI9cKJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rimutaka/posts/master/upwork-earnings/upwork-earnings-breakdown-2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pWtI9cKJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rimutaka/posts/master/upwork-earnings/upwork-earnings-breakdown-2.png" alt="UpWork earnings breakdown"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Upwork/comments/plwc3u/im_just_tired_of_bidding_for_work_with_no/"&gt;you don't give up before landing that very first job&lt;/a&gt;, the chances are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/3 quits before earning $1,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/4 quits before earning $10,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/3 quits before reaching $100,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the rest stays for a long haul and makes UpWork a significant source of their income&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#highearner-list"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  High-earner list
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not all doom and gloom. You can make a decent living in some categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9 out of 100 freelancers in my search for a Rust engineer had over $100k of total earnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~017778f12a2565f8f4"&gt;$185,288&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0147f8ce8730c3d633"&gt;$210,023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01f24fb7d3fa638cfa"&gt;$277,418&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~010ba56ab4bc5aba48"&gt;$281,584&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0144b974ba8a3d287f"&gt;$295,363&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~010f4e6ae0c1778aae"&gt;$425,345&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01aa1b7467b4eb49bc"&gt;$673,153&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01364b7feb73f1d7ae"&gt;$921,241&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01d95397aacaef6e88"&gt;$1,000,000&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1000000-club-do-you-want-to-be-a-member"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  $1,000,000 club - do you want to be a member?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01d95397aacaef6e88"&gt;Evgeniy T. from Catalonia&lt;/a&gt; tops our list with $1M+ of lifetime earnings. We don't know exactly how much he earned, but let's assume it is a million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--70YrUbeM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rimutaka/posts/master/upwork-earnings/one-million-dollars-club.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--70YrUbeM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rimutaka/posts/master/upwork-earnings/one-million-dollars-club.png" alt="One Million Dollar Club"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earning one million dollars sounds very inspirational. Who doesn't want to be a millionaire! Let's break it down:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$1,000,000 / 18,076 hrs worked = $55 per hour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;period over 10 years (started in 2011)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$117k per year&lt;/strong&gt; if adjusted for inflation and UpWork fees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we disregard the intangible values such as freedom this type of work brings, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$117k per year for someone with 10 years of full-stack experience is a rather low figure in today's world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same high-earners list doesn't look as impressive on an annual basis, except maybe entry #3:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/api/v1/freelancer/profile/~0147f8ce8730c3d633/details"&gt;$210,023&lt;/a&gt; / 12 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/api/v1/freelancer/profile/~01f24fb7d3fa638cfa/details"&gt;$277,418&lt;/a&gt; / 2 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/api/v1/freelancer/profile/~010ba56ab4bc5aba48/details"&gt;$281,584&lt;/a&gt; / 12 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/api/v1/freelancer/profile/~0144b974ba8a3d287f/details"&gt;$295,363&lt;/a&gt; / 6 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/api/v1/freelancer/profile/~010f4e6ae0c1778aae/details"&gt;$425,345&lt;/a&gt; / 11 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/api/v1/freelancer/profile/~01aa1b7467b4eb49bc/details"&gt;$673,153&lt;/a&gt; / 12 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/api/v1/freelancer/profile/~01364b7feb73f1d7ae/details"&gt;$921,241&lt;/a&gt; / 9 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/api/v1/freelancer/profile/~01d95397aacaef6e88/details"&gt;$1,000,000&lt;/a&gt; / 10 years &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, UpWork is no better or worse than any other career path. It does a good job of putting you in front of employers. If you are good and want to be poached, you most likely will be, &lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/legal#OPTINGOUT"&gt;despite what the Terms and Conditions&lt;/a&gt; say.&lt;/p&gt;

  Hey, are you open to offers of better employment or more contract work?

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#understanding-the-basics-of-docker-and-docker-commands-is-the-first-step-into-app-containerization"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Understanding the basics of docker and docker commands is the first step into app containerization.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Docker&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;docker-compose&lt;/code&gt;... When you first get into the docker world it can be a bit daunting to understand how all of these tools work and relate to each other. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I'll be playing around with a simple ruby container just using docker commands. No &lt;code&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt; nor &lt;code&gt;docker-compose&lt;/code&gt; for now. Just the basic docker commands. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sure helped me really grasp the basic concepts behind images and containers in isolation before moving into more complex concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#images-vs-containers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Images vs Containers
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In docker, it all begins with an image. The image sets the minimum base for a container to run. An image is an immutable file that will serve as a snapshot for the container, and the container will be the actual process on which you can work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It might help to look at it with a programming mindset - think of an image as a class and the container as an instance of that class. A container is an instance of an image.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purpose of this exercise, I want to run a simple ruby sandbox with &lt;code&gt;irb&lt;/code&gt;. This sandbox will be available in a container but for this container to run I'll need its snapshot - the ruby image. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, we don't have to build the ruby image ourselves. There are plenty of ready-made images available on &lt;a href="https://hub.docker.com/"&gt;Docker hub&lt;/a&gt; that you can use. If you search for &lt;code&gt;ruby&lt;/code&gt; you'll find the official ruby image in different versions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-raw-docker-run-endraw-command"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The &lt;code&gt;docker run&lt;/code&gt; command
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The command that starts a container process from an image is &lt;code&gt;docker run&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's understand how the command works by starting a ruby container. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you run &lt;code&gt;docker run ruby&lt;/code&gt; for the first time, it will first fetch the ruby image in its latest version from the docker hub and download it into your local docker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll get an output similar to this one:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Unable to find image &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'ruby:latest'&lt;/span&gt; locally
latest: Pulling from library/ruby
4c25b3090c26: Pull &lt;span class="nb"&gt;complete 
&lt;/span&gt;1acf565088aa: Pull &lt;span class="nb"&gt;complete 
&lt;/span&gt;b95c0dd0dc0d: Pull &lt;span class="nb"&gt;complete 
&lt;/span&gt;5cf06daf6561: Pull &lt;span class="nb"&gt;complete 
&lt;/span&gt;942374d5c114: Pull &lt;span class="nb"&gt;complete 
&lt;/span&gt;420c5b579440: Pull &lt;span class="nb"&gt;complete 
&lt;/span&gt;cdfe7730cd5c: Pull &lt;span class="nb"&gt;complete 
&lt;/span&gt;bfeceb400e58: Pull &lt;span class="nb"&gt;complete 
&lt;/span&gt;Digest: sha256:8849efdb1f006c5d7b26980f3aeb15f00fa2b5428cfbef8761aef5fc87491b89
Status: Downloaded newer image &lt;span class="k"&gt;for &lt;/span&gt;ruby:3.0.2
Switch to inspect mode.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ok, it looks like nothing happened yet but it does say that it downloaded the ruby image successfully. How can I confirm that? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-raw-docker-images-endraw-command"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The &lt;code&gt;docker images&lt;/code&gt; command
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you run &lt;code&gt;docker images&lt;/code&gt; you will see that you'll have the ruby with the &lt;code&gt;latest&lt;/code&gt; tag available for you. You should see something like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;REPOSITORY     TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
ruby           latest    b28f54b6ce55   3 days ago    881MB
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Note that the created timestamp you see in the docker images list is the date that the image was added to the docker library and not the date of the download to your local docker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going back to our command, it should have also started a container based on this image but where is it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-raw-docker-ps-endraw-command"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The &lt;code&gt;docker ps&lt;/code&gt; command
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;docker ps&lt;/code&gt; to list all the running containers.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The list is empty. Why? The run command should have started a new container process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you run &lt;code&gt;docker ps -a&lt;/code&gt; where &lt;code&gt;-a&lt;/code&gt; is the flag to show all containers (running and exited), your container will be there.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                    COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                        PORTS     NAMES                
948b3179783a   ruby:latest              &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"irb"&lt;/span&gt;                    10 seconds ago   Exited &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;0&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 5 seconds ago                eager_snyder  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Look at the Status column. It reads &lt;code&gt;Exited (0) 5 seconds ago&lt;/code&gt;. But why was this container exited? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may not have noticed, amongst the printed download messages, but there was an error message at the end. Let's see that message again by re-running the docker run command:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;-&amp;gt; docker run ruby
Switch to inspect mode.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is because the ruby image by default sends &lt;code&gt;irb&lt;/code&gt; as a command to the container. Once the container process is opened the &lt;code&gt;irb&lt;/code&gt; command should run. But the container cannot run &lt;code&gt;irb&lt;/code&gt; unless we tell it to run in the interactive terminal mode. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary: the process was opened, the container ran &lt;code&gt;irb&lt;/code&gt;, got the error message, the process was closed right after it, exiting the container with it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can run any command with the interactive terminal mode using the &lt;code&gt;-it&lt;/code&gt; flag.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;-&amp;gt; docker run &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-it&lt;/span&gt; ruby
irb&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;main&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;:001:0&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yeah, our sandbox is running!  🎉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and play with ruby a bit.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;irb&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;main&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;:001:0&amp;gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'hello'&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'world'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;.join&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;', '&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;.capitalize
&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Hello, world"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before you exit &lt;code&gt;irb&lt;/code&gt;,  open another terminal window and run &lt;code&gt;docker ps&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;CONTAINER ID   IMAGE         COMMAND   CREATED         STATUS         PORTS     NAMES
2ef882ad2b5b   ruby:latest   &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"irb"&lt;/span&gt;     4 minutes ago   Up 4 minutes             elated_satoshi
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There it is! We have a running container! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now exit &lt;code&gt;irb&lt;/code&gt; and run &lt;code&gt;docker ps&lt;/code&gt; again. It's empty. If you run &lt;code&gt;docker ps -a&lt;/code&gt; you should see your container there. It has an exited status again.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                    COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                      PORTS     NAMES
2ef882ad2b5b   ruby:latest              &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"irb"&lt;/span&gt;                    6 minutes ago    Exited &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;0&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 47 seconds ago             elated_satoshi
948b3179783a   ruby:latest              &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"irb"&lt;/span&gt;                    15 minutes ago   Exited &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;0&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 15 minutes ago             eager_snyder
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We've just learned another essential aspect of containers. &lt;strong&gt;The container has one main process. If that process stops, the container stops.&lt;/strong&gt; When we left &lt;code&gt;irb&lt;/code&gt;, the process stopped and the container was exited. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note also that we have two stopped containers. The first container with the random name &lt;code&gt;elated_satoshi&lt;/code&gt; is the one we've just opened and closed after playing with &lt;code&gt;irb&lt;/code&gt;, and the last one &lt;code&gt;eager_snyder&lt;/code&gt; is the container that was created when we ran the command without the interactive terminal flag. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;strong&gt;every time you run the ruby image, you're creating a different container.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#passing-other-commands-to-the-container"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Passing other commands to the container
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've seen that running &lt;code&gt;docker run -it ruby&lt;/code&gt; is the same as running  &lt;code&gt;docker -it ruby irb&lt;/code&gt;. We omit it because that's the default for ruby, but we can pass other commands for the container to run once it's opened. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, if we run &lt;code&gt;docker run -it ruby bash&lt;/code&gt; we will create an interactive bash shell in the container.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-it&lt;/span&gt; ruby bash
root@b1c73a63eef9:/# &lt;span class="nb"&gt;ls
&lt;/span&gt;bin  boot  dev  etc  home  lib  lib64  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var
root@b1c73a63eef9:/# ruby &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-v&lt;/span&gt;
ruby 3.0.2p107 &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;2021-07-07 revision 0db68f0233&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;x86_64-linux]
root@b1c73a63eef9:/# 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#stopping-and-removing-containers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Stopping and removing containers
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we saw earlier, every time you run the &lt;code&gt;docker run&lt;/code&gt; command a new container will be created. This means that with time you'll get a big list of stopped containers: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to remove stopped containers, you can just run &lt;code&gt;docker rm &amp;lt;container id&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the container is still running you might have to use the &lt;code&gt;stop&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;kill&lt;/code&gt; command before removing it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker stop &amp;lt;container &lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
docker &lt;span class="nb"&gt;rm&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt;container &lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to avoid exited containers to be kept after the process is closed there's a useful flag you can use with &lt;code&gt;docker run&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;-rm&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-rm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-ti&lt;/span&gt; ruby
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#keeping-container-processes-open"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Keeping container processes open
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that every time we left &lt;code&gt;irb&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt; in the previous exercises, we closed the process and the container. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there's a way you can exit yourself from the process without closing it. If you use &lt;code&gt;ctrl+p&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;ctrl+q&lt;/code&gt;, you will no longer see the process but it will still be running in the background. If you run &lt;code&gt;docker ps -l&lt;/code&gt;, where the &lt;code&gt;-l&lt;/code&gt; flag will get the latest container, you'll see your container there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to start a new container in the detached mode you can pass the detach flag, &lt;code&gt;-d&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;-&amp;gt; docker run &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-ti&lt;/span&gt; ruby
e68f13762ee83ea315b3d0a679432dd1963f276deb387aa3bdce9b4801f21979
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It prints out the &lt;code&gt;container id&lt;/code&gt; for you, but again, you can also confirm that there's a new process running with &lt;code&gt;docker ps&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;CONTAINER ID   IMAGE        COMMAND   CREATED         STATUS         PORTS     NAMES
e68f13762ee8   ruby:latest  &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"irb"&lt;/span&gt;     4 seconds ago   Up 3 seconds             crazy_varahamihira
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you want to jump in the process again, you can run the &lt;code&gt;docker attach &amp;lt;container id&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;-&amp;gt; docker attach e68f13762ee8
irb&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;main&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;:001:0&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can also add a new process to the same container, with the &lt;code&gt;exec&lt;/code&gt; command. Imagine you have &lt;code&gt;irb&lt;/code&gt; running in the background but you want to jump in the bash:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker &lt;span class="nb"&gt;exec&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-it&lt;/span&gt; e68f13762ee8 bash
root@e68f13762ee8:/#
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#naming-containers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Naming containers
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we noticed earlier, a container has a name but if you don't give it one, a random one will be assigned to it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to give it a name, you can pass it in a &lt;code&gt;--name&lt;/code&gt; flag.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--name&lt;/span&gt; ruby-sandbox &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-ti&lt;/span&gt; ruby&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And now run &lt;code&gt;docker ps&lt;/code&gt; to make sure there's a container with that name:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                    COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                   PORTS     NAMES                
aee3cd98a190   ruby:latest              &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"irb"&lt;/span&gt;                    10 seconds ago   Up 9 seconds                       ruby-sandbox  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#first-master-the-fundamentals"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  First master the fundamentals!
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of commands were covered in this article but I believe that there is only a handful of fundamental concepts in docker. The goal of this article was to share a bit of the process and exercises I've gone through to understand what docker really is. It's a compilation of stuff I was first taught by my colleague &lt;a href="https://leandronsp.com/"&gt;Leandro&lt;/a&gt; (he has great content on this topic, go check him out) and that I also got from basic docker courses. Have fun! 🐳&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>7 Useful VS Code extension for junior web developers</title>
      <author>Stefi Rosca</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 19:45:26 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/stefirosca/7-useful-vs-code-extension-for-junior-web-developers-3pg5</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/stefirosca/7-useful-vs-code-extension-for-junior-web-developers-3pg5</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my early days of coding I used to get quickly frustrated when my code didn't run. It felt like I was doing everything right but the web app still didn't work. Mostly it was a silly mistake, some sort of typo, a missed comma, bracket or semicolon. This made me question my potential of becoming a developer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More experienced developers always had fancy extensions and in the beginning I felt quite nervous downloading any. I didn't see the value and I didn't want to add stuff that might break my current setup or that I didn't quite understand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the extensions I share below I became a bit more productive and spend less time debugging. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-prettier"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Prettier
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This extension is a code formatter that you can set to automatically format your code on save. This will make it easier to read and write code as it removes unnecessary space and aligns everything well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It works with JavaScript, TypeScript, Flow, JSX, JSON, CSS , SCSS, Less, HTML, Vue, Angular, GraphQL, Markdown and YAML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5fmPNVGG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2u0z8x742go3zqaanvfa.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5fmPNVGG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2u0z8x742go3zqaanvfa.gif" alt="Demo Prettier extension"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make this extension format your code automatically on save you have to change this in settings as per the screenshot below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--20O1tqLc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/y1quup7fsar69nj2peh3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--20O1tqLc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/y1quup7fsar69nj2peh3.png" alt="Settings - automatically format your code on save"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
   &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Get Prettier here &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-highlight-matching-tag"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Highlight Matching Tag
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This extension is useful to find matching opening and/or closing tags especially when having tags with a lot of tags inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jIPqrayN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/68pwj26la1p0x9gare9z.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jIPqrayN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/68pwj26la1p0x9gare9z.png" alt="Demo Highlight Matching Tag"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
   &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vincaslt.highlight-matching-tag"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Get Highlight Matching Tag here &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-auto-rename-tag"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Auto Rename Tag
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had to change maybe an h1 for an h3 or div for a ul? If so with this extension when you rename one HTML/XML tag, you can automatically rename the paired HTML/XML tag. Pretty useful I'd say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pXq2HpAp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fnd8hsasvg654c8luvtj.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pXq2HpAp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fnd8hsasvg654c8luvtj.gif" alt="Demo Auto Rename Tag"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
   &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Get Auto Rename Tag here &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-error-lens"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Error Lens
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit annoying at times as I don't finish typing and it tells me something is missing but found it super useful for those forgotten brackets or commas. It highlights errors visibly right in the line where something is not right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--20I6caFq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9oefz8qzd865hs99ola6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--20I6caFq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9oefz8qzd865hs99ola6.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-06 at 15.46.00"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HUqTUZv1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/do9n64p6nwz7jm8fj03s.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HUqTUZv1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/do9n64p6nwz7jm8fj03s.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-06 at 15.45.14"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
   &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Get Error Lens here &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-live-server"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Live Server
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A helpful extension when working on static websites - HTML, CSS and JS and no framework as you won't have to reload every time you make a change. After each save it will be automatically reload the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
   &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Get Live Server here &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-sort-lines"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. Sort Lines
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if one really needs this extensions but I've found that some people like to sort their CSS lines plus you look cool. Simply select the content you want to sort alphabetically and click: Keybound to F9 on a Mac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fyBDZeu5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/l4db11y7nb2jhtw3c3ik.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fyBDZeu5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/l4db11y7nb2jhtw3c3ik.gif" alt="Demo Sort Lines"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#7-bracket-pair-colorizer-2"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  7. Bracket Pair Colorizer 2
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This extension highlights matching brackets with the same colour. This makes it easier to find a missing bracket. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demo without extension: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2vZeWMy5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fxo0nkk0l7504u0xli6p.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2vZeWMy5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fxo0nkk0l7504u0xli6p.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-06 at 15.37.11"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demo with extension:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7wCfndI4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xm2wrhdjrx71rq2bjdm0.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7wCfndI4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xm2wrhdjrx71rq2bjdm0.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-06 at 15.41.07"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although with the new VS Code update you could activate this functionality directly the IDE by setting the bracketPairColorization.enabled in the settings section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
   &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Get Bracket Pair Colorizer 2 here &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus extensions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint"&gt;ESLint&lt;/a&gt; - super useful for debugging as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets"&gt;ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme"&gt;Material Icon Theme&lt;/a&gt; - makes your IDE more fancy looking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens"&gt;GitLens&lt;/a&gt; - helpful especially when working with others via source control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Do you use other extensions that you find useful? Please add them in the comments below. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sass Crash Course in a Book</title>
      <author>Programming with Shahan</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 19:43:13 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/codewithshahan/sass-crash-course-in-a-book-3kg2</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/codewithshahan/sass-crash-course-in-a-book-3kg2</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-sass"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🤷‍♀️What is Sass
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sass (which stands for Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is an extension of CSS that enables you to use things like variables, nested rules, inline imports, and more. It also helps to keep things organized and allows you to create style sheets faster. The benefit of using Sass is that sass is compatible with all versions of CSS.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Before continue, I encourage you to read this full article and then watch my sass crash course video which is only 15 minutes. This way your  Sass memory will remain much longer than usual.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--abp_T4br--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6s8wyvwxl2sgjjb6uzc0.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--abp_T4br--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6s8wyvwxl2sgjjb6uzc0.png" alt="Sass course in a book by shahan"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#01-store-data-with-sass-variables"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  01. 📦Store Data with Sass Variables
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One feature of &lt;strong&gt;Sass&lt;/strong&gt; that's different than &lt;strong&gt;CSS&lt;/strong&gt; is it uses &lt;strong&gt;variables&lt;/strong&gt;. They can be declared and set to &lt;em&gt;store data&lt;/em&gt; as &lt;strong&gt;variables&lt;/strong&gt; similar to &lt;strong&gt;JavaScript.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In JavaScript, variables are declared using &lt;strong&gt;let&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;const&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;keywords.&lt;/em&gt; In &lt;strong&gt;Sass&lt;/strong&gt;, variables start with a &lt;strong&gt;$&lt;/strong&gt; followed by the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;variable name&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#here-is-a-real-example"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Here is a real example🔻
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say we need to use the success color '&lt;strong&gt;green&lt;/strong&gt;' in different places without repeating its name. So, we need to write code like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight scss"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$success-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;green&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then we use this global variable in different places like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sass"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.success&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$sucess-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$success-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One example where variables are useful is when a number of elements need to be the same color. If that color is changed, the only place to edit the code is the variable value👌.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#02-nest-css-with-sass"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  02. 🤏Nest CSS with Sass
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sass will let you &lt;strong&gt;nest&lt;/strong&gt; your &lt;strong&gt;CSS selectors&lt;/strong&gt; in a way that follows the same visual hierarchy of your &lt;strong&gt;HTML&lt;/strong&gt; which is a useful way of organizing a style sheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally, each element is targeted on a different line to style it, like so👇&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Without Nesting:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sass"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;footer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;footer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nl"&gt;list-style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;footer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After Nesting:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sass"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;footer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nl"&gt;list-style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

   &lt;span class="nt"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is where nesting can help organize your code by placing &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;child style rules&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; within the respective &lt;strong&gt;parent elements&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#03-create-reusable-css-with-mixins"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  03. 🧣Create Reusable CSS with Mixins
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Sass&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mixin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a &lt;em&gt;group of CSS declarations&lt;/em&gt;. So we can &lt;strong&gt;reuse&lt;/strong&gt; them in our &lt;em&gt;style sheet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you know newer CSS features take time before they are fully compatible with all browsers. As features are adopted to browsers, &lt;strong&gt;CSS&lt;/strong&gt; rules using them may need &lt;strong&gt;vendor prefixes&lt;/strong&gt;. As an example b*&lt;em&gt;ox-shadow&lt;/em&gt;* &lt;em&gt;property&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Without Mixins:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sass"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.card&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;-webkit-box-shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;4px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#fff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;-moz-box-shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;4px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#fff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;-ms-box-shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;4px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#fff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nl"&gt;box-shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;4px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#fff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Imagine, we have different types of cards on our website with different effects of box-shadow. It's a lot of typing to re-write this rule to support all browsers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where Mixins come in. Mixins are like JavaScript &lt;strong&gt;functions&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;CSS&lt;/strong&gt;. Here is how to write one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With Mixins:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sass"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;@mixin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;box-shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$blur&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;-webkit-box-shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$blur&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;-moz-box-shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$blur&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;-ms-box-shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$blur&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nl"&gt;box-shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$blur&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The definition starts with @mixin followed by a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;custom name&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The parameters (the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;$x, $y, $blur&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;$c&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in the example above) are optional. Now any time a &lt;strong&gt;box-shadow&lt;/strong&gt; rule is needed, only a single line calling the mixin replaces having to type all the &lt;em&gt;vendor prefixes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to &lt;strong&gt;call @mixin&lt;/strong&gt; with the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/include"&gt;@include&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; directive. Have a look👇&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sass"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.card&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;@include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nd"&gt;box-shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;5px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.popup-card&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;@include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nd"&gt;box-shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;2px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#04-use-if-and-else-to-add-logic-to-your-styles"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  04. 🔍Use @if and &lt;a class="mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/else"&gt;@else&lt;/a&gt;
 to Add Logic To Your Styles
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Sass, @if &lt;a class="mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/else"&gt;@else&lt;/a&gt;
 statement is similar to JavaScript. It is very useful in Sass when we search for a specific condition before applying any styles. like so,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sass"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;@mixin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;text-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$val&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;@if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$val&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;danger&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;@else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$val&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;green&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;@else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;black&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then this is how we need to apply this mixin in different places:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sass"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="k"&gt;@include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nd"&gt;text-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;danger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2rem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;We&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;can&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;additional&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.sucess-text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;@include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nd"&gt;text-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;We&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;can&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;additional&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#05-sass-loop"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  05. ➰Sass @Loop
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sass has several loop options, much like other programming languages. They include the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;@for loop, @each loop, and @while loop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. These loops are an incredibly powerful tool for generating &lt;strong&gt;CSS&lt;/strong&gt; code because you can defer code generation into an &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;iterable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#%E2%99%BEuse-for-to-create-a-sass-loop"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ♾Use @for to Create a Sass Loop:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Sass&lt;/strong&gt;, @for is used in two ways: "&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;start through end&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;" or "&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;start to end&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;". The main difference between these two methods is that the &lt;strong&gt;"start to end"&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;excludes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;em&gt;end&lt;/em&gt; numbers as part of the &lt;em&gt;count&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;"start through end"&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;includes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;em&gt;end&lt;/em&gt; number as part of the &lt;em&gt;count&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here is a **start through end&lt;/em&gt;* example:🔻*&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sass"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;@for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;through&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;text-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt; { &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;#{$i}&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; part is the syntax to combine a variable ( &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; ) with text to make a &lt;strong&gt;string&lt;/strong&gt;. So, when this Sass file is &lt;strong&gt;converted&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;CSS&lt;/strong&gt;, it will looks like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sass"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.text-1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.text-2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;20px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.text-3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;30px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.text-4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;40px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.text-5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;50px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is why @for is a powerful way to create a very long &lt;strong&gt;grid&lt;/strong&gt; layout or any &lt;strong&gt;HTML&lt;/strong&gt; elements with just one line of code. Now you have 5 different text sizes for your website available as &lt;strong&gt;CSS classes&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"start to end"&lt;/strong&gt; is the same as &lt;strong&gt;"start through end"&lt;/strong&gt;. Just remember &lt;strong&gt;"start to end"&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;excludes&lt;/em&gt; the end number as part of the &lt;em&gt;count&lt;/em&gt;, like so:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sass"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;@for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;text-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt; {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//The result will look like this:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.text-1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.text-2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;20px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.text-3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;30px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.text-4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;40px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.text-5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;50px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here you can see the last count (6) is not included in this loop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#use-each-to-map-over-items-in-a-list"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🏹Use @each to Map Over Items in a List
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;@each&lt;/strong&gt; rule makes it easy to emit styles or evaluate code for each element of a list or each pair in a map. Once each iteration, the variable gets assigned to the &lt;strong&gt;current value&lt;/strong&gt; from the &lt;strong&gt;list or map.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a look without map:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sass"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;@each&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$color&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;green&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;yellow&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;-text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt; {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a look with Map:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sass"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$colors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;color1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;color2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;green&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;color3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;yellow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;@each&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$color&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$colors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;-text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt; {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can see, the map has slightly different syntax just like JavaScript. So, here the &lt;strong&gt;$key&lt;/strong&gt; variable is needed to reference the keys in the map. If you don't supply &lt;strong&gt;$key&lt;/strong&gt;, the compiled CSS would have color1, color2... and will never touch the actual value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of the above code examples are converted into the following CSS:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sass"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.red-text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.green-text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;green&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.yellow-text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;yellow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#use-while-until-a-condition-is-met-to-apply-a-style"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🔐Use @while Until a Condition is Met to Apply a Style:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Sass&lt;/strong&gt;, there is no difference with the &lt;strong&gt;@while&lt;/strong&gt; directive compare to JavaScript. It creates &lt;strong&gt;CSS rules until a condition is met&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier, we use the &lt;strong&gt;@for&lt;/strong&gt; directive to create repeated tasks without duplication. It can be done with &lt;strong&gt;@while.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a look:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sass"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;@while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;text-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt; { &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;}&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, first, we take a variable and set it to 1. Next, we check the condition with the &lt;strong&gt;@while&lt;/strong&gt; directive to create different sizes of text while $i is less than 6.  Make sure to &lt;strong&gt;increment&lt;/strong&gt; $i by &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; to avoid an infinite loop &lt;strong&gt;after setting the CSS rule&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#06-%F0%9F%97%B3use-partial-to-split-your-styles-into-smaller-chunks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  06. 🗳Use _Partial to Split Your Styles into Smaller Chunks
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A partial is a Sass file named with a leading underscore, i.e: _partial. scss . The underscore lets Sass know that the specific file is partial and will not be generated into a CSS file. Sass partials are meant to be used with the @import directive. This is a great way to group similar code into a module to it organized.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if all your text color is saved in a separate sass file called "&lt;strong&gt;_textColor.scss&lt;/strong&gt;", and you want them in the &lt;strong&gt;main.scss&lt;/strong&gt; module, this is how to use them in the main Sass file:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sass"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;@import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'textColor'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt; that you don't need to specify the underscore and file extension in the import statement. Because Sass understands it is a partial. Once a partial is imported into a file, all text color, mixins, and other bunch of code are available to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#07-extends-one-set-of-css-styles-to-another-element"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  07. 💱Extends One Set of CSS Styles to Another Element
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;@extend is a feature of Sass that allows classes to share a set of properties with one another.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the below block of CSS rules style .card class. it has some properties like background color, width, height.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sass"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.card&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#fff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;200px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;150px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now you want another card called &lt;strong&gt;".popup-card&lt;/strong&gt;". It has the same properties just like the base &lt;strong&gt;".card"&lt;/strong&gt; class. But we need additional property in the &lt;strong&gt;popup card&lt;/strong&gt;. It is possible to &lt;em&gt;copy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;paste&lt;/em&gt; from the base card to the target class. But there is a much better way to do it with the &lt;strong&gt;@extend&lt;/strong&gt; directive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a look:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sass"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.popup-card&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;@extend&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;5px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#349db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you can see, we can &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;overwrite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; styles in the &lt;strong&gt;base&lt;/strong&gt; class to the &lt;strong&gt;target&lt;/strong&gt; class by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;reassigning&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; the values. Otherwise, we will have the same properties as base &lt;strong&gt;".card"&lt;/strong&gt; as well as our &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;additional styles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="#tldr"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  TLDR
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without good performance, machine learning (ML) models won’t provide much value in real life. We’ll introduce some common strategies to improve model performance including selecting the best algorithm, tuning model settings, and adding new features (aka feature engineering).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#outline"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Outline
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the model good or bad?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strategies for improving the model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When to stop improving the model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conclusion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the right developer education (e.g. &lt;a href="https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks"&gt;Building your first machine learning model&lt;/a&gt;, it’s easy to start training machine learning models. However, it’s difficult to get great results on the first try that meets your product goals. After training the model, it can take a long time to tune the model and improve performance (we’ll use tuning model and improving model performance interchangeably in this article). Different types of models have different tuning strategies. In this article, we’ll introduce common strategies for model tuning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#is-the-model-good-or-bad"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Is the model good or bad?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before tuning the model, we first need to know whether the model performance is good or bad. If you don’t know how to measure a model’s performance, you can check our previous blog articles: &lt;a href="https://www.mage.ai/blog/definitive-guide-to-accuracy-precision-recall-for-product-developers"&gt;The definitive guide to Accuracy, Precision, and Recall for product developers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.mage.ai/blog/product-developers-guide-to-ml-regression-model-metrics"&gt;A product developer’s guide to ML regression model metrics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each model has baseline metrics. As introduced in our previous &lt;a href="https://www.mage.ai/blog/definitive-guide-to-accuracy-precision-recall-for-product-developers"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, we can use “mode category” as the baseline metric for classification models. If your model’s performance is better than the baseline metric, then congratulations, your model isn’t bad and you’re off to a good start. If the model’s performance metrics are worse than the baseline metrics, it means the model doesn’t find valuable insights from the data. Then, there’ll be a lot to do in order to improve the performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another scenario is when the model performs “too good”, e.g. 99% precision and 99% recall. This isn’t a good sign and probably indicates some issues in your model. The possible reason is “data leakage”. We’ll talk about how to solve this problem in the “Remove data leakage features” section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#strategies-for-improving-the-model"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Strategies for improving the model
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, there are 3 directions for model tuning: select a better algorithm, tune model parameters, and improve data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#compare-multiple-algorithms"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Compare multiple algorithms
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparing multiple algorithms is a straightforward idea to improve the model performance. Different algorithms are better suited for different types of datasets. We can train them all together and find the one with the best performance. For example, for classification models, we can try &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"&gt;Logistic Regression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine"&gt;Support Vector Machine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;XGBoost&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network"&gt;Neural Network&lt;/a&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AZc-ZDjB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jvf0jfqo3s8fknbhvkw8.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AZc-ZDjB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jvf0jfqo3s8fknbhvkw8.png" alt="0_4CEJ3J6P0yQor8EK"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Source: &lt;a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html"&gt;https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#hyperparameter-tuning"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Hyperparameter tuning
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hyperparameter tuning is a common approach to tune models. In machine learning models, there are some parameters chosen before the learning process starts, which are called hyperparameters. Some examples are the maximum depth allowed for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree"&gt;decision tree&lt;/a&gt;, and the number of trees included in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest"&gt;random forest&lt;/a&gt;. Hyperparameters will influence the outcome of the learning process. Hyperparameter tuning is choosing the optimal set of parameters so that we can get optimal outcomes from the learning process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cqgzPZ9c--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/53gp7mry206ms2iz8rxo.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cqgzPZ9c--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/53gp7mry206ms2iz8rxo.jpg" alt="0_C5QGL3maM_eBrSV-"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Source: &lt;a href="https://image.slidesharecdn.com/sparkfornlp4x3-160521214311/95/data-by-the-bay-2016-may-17-2016-20-638.jpg?cb=1463867059%5D"&gt;Slideshare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recommend using publicly available libraries to help with hyperparameter tuning, e.g. &lt;a href="https://optuna.org/"&gt;optuna&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll have a separate article for hyperparameter tuning in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#trade-precision-with-recall"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Trade precision with recall
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For classification models, we usually measure the model performance with 2 metrics: precision and recall. Depending on the problem, you may want to optimize for either precision or recall. There’s a quick way to tune models to make a trade-off between the 2 metrics. Classification model predicts the probability of a label class. We can simply increase or decrease the probability threshold to get higher precision or recall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if we build a model to predict whether a passenger survives in the Titanic disaster, the model can predict the probability of the passenger living or dying. If the probability is above 50%, the model will predict that the passenger will survive. Otherwise, the model will predict the passenger won’t survive. If we want a higher precision, we can increase the probability threshold. Then, the model will predict fewer passengers surviving but will be more precise. If we want to increase recall and cover more passengers that’ll possibly survive, we can decrease the probability threshold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1Ft6NmgD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wo530do6cziws7z21dcx.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1Ft6NmgD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wo530do6cziws7z21dcx.png" alt="0_tPxHSM4l8C5XFsRy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#feature-engineering"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Feature engineering
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides selecting the best algorithm and tuning parameters, we can generate more features from existing data, which is called feature engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-new-features"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Create new features
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating new features requires some domain knowledge and creativity. Here are some examples of newly created features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a feature for counting the number of letters in the text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a feature counting the number of words in a text.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a feature that understands the meaning of the text (e.g. word embeddings).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aggregate user event count over the past 7 days, 30 days, or 90 days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extract “day”, “month”, “year”, and “days since holiday” features from a date or timestamp feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#enrich-training-data-with-public-datasets"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Enrich training data with public datasets
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you exhaust your ideas of generating new features from existing datasets, another idea is to get features from public datasets. For example, you want to build a model to predict whether a user will convert to membership but you don’t have too much user information in your datasets. However, you find the dataset contains ‘email’ and ‘company’ columns. Then you can get user and company data from a third-party, including user location, user age, company size, etc. This data can be used to enrich your training data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OZQIhhlJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7efky34ogdmlfn72s2i0.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OZQIhhlJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7efky34ogdmlfn72s2i0.gif" alt="0_LkmNxIBycT9ApxcS"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;Third-party, but I guess enriched data is worth celebrating.

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#feature-selection"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Feature selection
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not always good to add more features. Removing irrelevant and noisy features could help reduce model training time and improve model performance. There are multiple &lt;a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html#feature-selection"&gt;feature selection&lt;/a&gt; methods in scikit-learn that can be used to get rid of irrelevant features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#remove-data-leakage-features"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Remove data leakage features
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned earlier, 1 scenario is that the model’s performance is “too good”. However, when you deploy the model and use it in production, you get very poor performance. The possible reason for this issue is “data leakage”, which is a common pitfall for model training. Data leakage means we use some features that happen after the target variable and contain the information of the target variable. In real life, we won’t have those data leakage features when we make predictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, you want to predict whether or not a user will open an email but your features include whether or not the user clicked on the email. A user can only click the email if they opened it. If the model sees that a user clicked it, then it will 100% predict they will open it. The problem is in a real life scenario, we can’t know whether someone will click an email before they open the email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--itQh9sCf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/68q26vqk9wmqdtq9e1l2.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--itQh9sCf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/68q26vqk9wmqdtq9e1l2.gif" alt="0_k1D3UMoFEHEW-TLF"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;Remove data leakage! (Source: &lt;a href="https://c.tenor.com/u8ukYJDixewAAAAC/leaking-water-leaking.gif"&gt;Tenor&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can debug the data leakage issue with &lt;a href="https://www.mage.ai/blog/how-to-interpret-explain-machine-learning-models-using-shap-values"&gt;SHAP values&lt;/a&gt;. With the &lt;a href="https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html"&gt;SHAP&lt;/a&gt; library, we can plot the chart to show features with the most impact and how they impact the model’s output directionally. If the top features are highly correlated with the target variable and have very high weights, they’re potentially data leakage features and we can remove them from the training data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vi-NPZ4B--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7czf25xryghho4eb0d16.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vi-NPZ4B--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7czf25xryghho4eb0d16.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#more-data"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  More data
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, getting more training data is an obvious and efficient way to improve model performance. More training data enables the model to find more insights and get better accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cQ6OCxVw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cfkhmow3wmaqhnv5t2lw.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cQ6OCxVw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cfkhmow3wmaqhnv5t2lw.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;More data! (Source: &lt;a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/lrc1TZHRYxj7lGM3Vg/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47aoqjaushyaf8xrt1si85acq050hrb3os40a7iheh&amp;amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;amp;ct=g"&gt;Giphy&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#when-to-stop-improving-the-model"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  When to stop improving the model
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing when to stop is a tough question with no perfect answer. There’s no hard stopping point for model tuning. &lt;br&gt;
There could always be new ideas to bring on new data, create new features, or tune algorithms. The bare minimum criteria is that the model performance should at least be better than baseline metrics. Once we meet the minimum criteria, this is the process we recommend for improving models and deciding when to stop:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try all the strategies to improve models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compare the model performance with some other metrics you have to verify whether the model metrics make sense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After doing several rounds of model tuning, evaluate whether it’s worth spending time trying new ideas with the improvements you get.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the model performs well and you can barely get improvements after trying out a handful of ideas, deploy the model to production and measure the performance in production.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the performance is similar between production and training, then your model is good to go. If the production performance is worse than the performance in training, that indicates some issues in the training. The issues could be the model is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting"&gt;overfitting&lt;/a&gt; the training data, or the model has data leakage issues. You’ll need to go back and further tune the model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Model tuning is a lengthy and repetitive process to test new ideas, retrain the model, evaluate the model, and compare the metrics. If you wonder how this process can be simplified, stay tuned for future articles about how &lt;a href="https://www.mage.ai/"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt; can help you improve models.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Recoil instead of Redux For State Management In React Applications</title>
      <author>OpenReplay Tech Blog</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 18:50:42 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/asayerio_techblog/using-recoil-instead-of-redux-for-state-management-in-react-applications-58c3</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by author &lt;a href="https://blog.openreplay.com/authors/origho-precious"&gt;Origho Precious&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among all the state management libraries available for use in React apps, &lt;a href="https://redux.js.org/"&gt;Redux&lt;/a&gt; is the most popular even ahead of React’s &lt;a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html"&gt;Context APIs&lt;/a&gt;. There are also other awesome state management libraries used in React apps one of which is &lt;a href="https://recoiljs.org/"&gt;Recoil&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Recoil&lt;/strong&gt; unlike Redux is very easy to set up, even easier to set up than the new &lt;a href="https://redux-toolkit.js.org/"&gt;Redux toolkit&lt;/a&gt; library. &lt;br&gt;
In this article, we will learn how to use Recoil to manage states in React apps instead of Redux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-recoil"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Recoil?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://recoiljs.org/"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recoil is a state management library for React applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recoil&lt;/strong&gt; is an open-source state management library with more than 14k stars on &lt;a href="https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;, it was invented by Dave McCabe, a Software Engineer at Facebook. It provides a global state so all components in a React application can share states easily and it is minimal compared to Redux with no boilerplate code setup needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recoil provides a &lt;strong&gt;data-graph&lt;/strong&gt; that flows from shared states into React components. The two core concepts of Recoil according to the official &lt;a href="https://recoiljs.org/docs/introduction/core-concepts"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://recoiljs.org/docs/introduction/core-concepts#atoms"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atoms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which are units of the global state provided by Recoil, components can access and subscribe to changes made to them. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://recoiljs.org/docs/introduction/core-concepts#selectors"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selectors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with which we can transform states either synchronously or asynchronously, and components can also access and subscribe to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-use-recoil"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why Use Recoil?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering that we have many other state management libraries out there and also React’s Context API and component state, why then should we use Recoil in our React apps?. Let’s highlight some of the reasons below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recoil just like Redux provides a &lt;strong&gt;global state&lt;/strong&gt;. With Recoil, we won’t have to pass states as props down to children components in order to share them between components (a concept known as &lt;strong&gt;prop drilling&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once we hook up a component to any &lt;strong&gt;Atom&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Selector,&lt;/strong&gt; they are subscribed to it, so any update made to that piece of state will be reflected across the app to wherever it’s being used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With Recoil &lt;strong&gt;Selectors,&lt;/strong&gt; we can transform a state synchronously or asynchronously and use the derived state anywhere in our app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recoil is &lt;strong&gt;minimal&lt;/strong&gt; and requires no boilerplate code to get started. Redux is very popular but many developers still frown at it because of the amount of code they need to write to set it up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#building-a-react-app-with-recoil"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Building a React App with Recoil
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have now gone over what Recoil is, its core concepts, and why you should consider using it. &lt;br&gt;
In this section, we will build an &lt;code&gt;anime-quote-generator&lt;/code&gt;, this app will fetch quotes from an external &lt;a href="https://animechan.vercel.app"&gt;API&lt;/a&gt; based on selected animes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s get started by generating a new React app with the command below.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx create-react-app anime-quote-generator
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After that, open it in your favorite code editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we will install Recoil and get started building our app components. Run the command below to install Recoil.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn add recoil
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OR&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install recoil
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s configure our app to use Recoil. Navigate to &lt;code&gt;src/index.js&lt;/code&gt;, here, we only need to wrap our entire app with &lt;code&gt;RecoilRoot&lt;/code&gt;; a Recoil component. Let’s do that below.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ReactDOM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react-dom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;RecoilRoot&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;recoil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./index.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ReactDOM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;RecoilRoot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/RecoilRoot&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We have successfully set up Recoil in our React app just by wrapping all our app’s components with it. You see how easy the setup is, to do this using Redux we will have to write some lines of code to create a store before wrapping our app with the React-Redux Provider component that will contain the store. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have set up Recoil in our app, let’s start building components, pages, and sharing states with Recoil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#building-animepill-component"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Building AnimePill Component
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This component will render the title of an anime passed to it, and when clicked, it will route us to a page where we’ll see quotes from that anime. First, we need to install &lt;a href="https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start"&gt;react-router-dom&lt;/a&gt; for routing between pages in our app and &lt;a href="https://styled-components.com/"&gt;styled-components&lt;/a&gt; for styling. Let’s do that with the command below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn add react-router-dom styled-components
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OR&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install react-router-dom styled-components
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, let’s create a folder in the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; folder, called &lt;code&gt;components&lt;/code&gt;. In the &lt;code&gt;components&lt;/code&gt; folder, create a folder called &lt;code&gt;AnimePills&lt;/code&gt; and a file called &lt;code&gt;AnimePills.jsx&lt;/code&gt; inside that folder. The path to this file from &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; should be &lt;code&gt;src/components/AnimePills/AnimePills.jsx&lt;/code&gt;, now add the code below to that file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react-router-dom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;styled&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;styled-components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AnimePill&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;anime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;StyledPill&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`/anime/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;anime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;anime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/StyledPill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;StyledPill&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;styled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`
  border-radius: 999px;
  &amp;amp; a {
    display: block;
    text-decoration: none;
    color: #333;
    padding: 1rem 2rem;
  }
`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AnimePill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Above, we just created a component called &lt;code&gt;AnimePills&lt;/code&gt;. This component takes in 2 props; &lt;code&gt;anime&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt;, with the anime we will construct a link using the &lt;code&gt;Link&lt;/code&gt; component from &lt;code&gt;react-router-dom&lt;/code&gt; and we will use the color as a background-color. We then style the component with &lt;code&gt;styled-components&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#building-quote-and-smallquote-components"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Building Quote and SmallQuote components
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be building 2 components in this section. Let’s start with the &lt;code&gt;Quote&lt;/code&gt; component. Inside our &lt;code&gt;components&lt;/code&gt; folder, create a new folder called &lt;code&gt;Quote&lt;/code&gt; and a file &lt;code&gt;Quote.jsx&lt;/code&gt; inside it. In this component, we will simply render a quote from Naruto and style the component with &lt;code&gt;styled-components&lt;/code&gt;. Add the code below to the file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;styled&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;styled-components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Quote&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;quote&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;anime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Naruto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;character&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Pain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;quote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Because of the existence of love - sacrifice is born. As well as hate. Then one comprehends... one knows PAIN.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;StyledQuote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;{quote.quote}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;character&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;quote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;character&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;in&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;em&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;anime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;quote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;anime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/StyledQuote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;StyledQuote&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;styled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`
  background: #dbece5;
  padding: 3rem 5rem;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  &amp;amp; &amp;gt; p {
    font-size: 2rem;
    letter-spacing: 2px;
    text-align: center;
    font-style: italic;
    margin-bottom: 3rem;
    background: #fff;
    border-radius: 0.5rem;
    padding: 3rem;
  }
  &amp;amp; &amp;gt; h4 {
    font-size: 1.5rem;
    font-weight: 500;
    letter-spacing: 2px;
    span {
      padding: 5px 10px;
    }
    em {
      font-size: 1.2rem;
    }
    &amp;amp; &amp;gt; .character {
      background: #b8dace;
    }
    &amp;amp; &amp;gt; .anime {
      background: #f5e7e4;
    }
  }
`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Quote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, let’s create the &lt;code&gt;SmallQuote&lt;/code&gt; component. This component expects 3 props (anime, character and quote), we will render these props, and style the component with &lt;code&gt;styled-components&lt;/code&gt;. To do this, create a folder inside &lt;code&gt;src/components&lt;/code&gt; called &lt;code&gt;SmallQuote&lt;/code&gt;, inside it create a file &lt;code&gt;SmallQuote.jsx&lt;/code&gt; and add the code below&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;styled&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;styled-components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;SmallQuote&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;quote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;character&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;anime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;StyledQuote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;{quote}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;character&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;character&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;in&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;em&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;anime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;anime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/StyledQuote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;StyledQuote&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;styled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`
  background: #dbece5;
  padding: 1.5rem 2.5rem;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  &amp;amp; &amp;gt; p {
    font-size: 1rem;
    letter-spacing: 2px;
    text-align: center;
    font-style: italic;
    background: #fff;
    border-radius: 0.5rem;
    padding: 1.5rem;
    margin-bottom: 1.5rem;
  }
  &amp;amp; &amp;gt; h4 {
    font-size: 1rem;
    font-weight: 500;
    letter-spacing: 2px;
    span {
      padding: 3px 5px;
    }
    em {
      font-size: 1rem;
    }
    &amp;amp; &amp;gt; .character {
      background: #b8dace;

    &amp;amp; &amp;gt; .anime {
      background: #f5e7e4;
    }
  }
`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;SmallQuote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Above, we just built a component called &lt;code&gt;SmallQuote&lt;/code&gt; and styled it with &lt;code&gt;styled-components&lt;/code&gt;. It is very similar to &lt;code&gt;Quote&lt;/code&gt; component, the purpose of splitting them is to make the code easier to understand. So if you want to make the &lt;code&gt;Quote&lt;/code&gt; component reusable to include features of the &lt;code&gt;SmallQuote&lt;/code&gt;  component, feel free to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we will be building our app &lt;strong&gt;atoms&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;selector.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#building-our-app-global-state-atoms-and-selector"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get started, navigate into our &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; folder and create a folder called &lt;code&gt;store&lt;/code&gt;, inside this folder create a file called &lt;code&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt;. In this file, we will build all the atoms we need and also a selector to modify one of the atoms. Let’s start with the first atom, &lt;code&gt;animeTitles&lt;/code&gt;. Add the code below to create our first atom.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;atom&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;recoil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;animeTitles&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;atom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;animeTitleList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Above, we created an Atom by importing &lt;code&gt;atom&lt;/code&gt; from recoil and called it &lt;code&gt;animeTitles&lt;/code&gt;. We then defined the required properties of an atom, which are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;key&lt;/code&gt; - this should be a unique ID among other atoms and selectors we will create in the app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; - this is the default value of the atom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing this with Redux, we will have to create an &lt;a href="https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-7-standard-patterns#action-creators"&gt;action creator&lt;/a&gt; with a specific type, the action creator will return the type and a payload passed to it, and also we will create a &lt;a href="https://redux.js.org/understanding/thinking-in-redux/glossary#reducer"&gt;reducer&lt;/a&gt; to update our redux store. but with Recoil we don’t need to handle all of that, with the &lt;code&gt;key&lt;/code&gt; prop, Recoil knows the part of the global state to update so when we pass data to update the state it does it correctly and we won’t need to compare action types as we would do in Redux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the same pattern, let’s create another atom called &lt;code&gt;animePageNum&lt;/code&gt;. we will use this atom to hold page number, this will help us properly handle pagination in this app. Add the code below to this file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;animeListPageNum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;atom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;animeListPageNum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next let’s create a selector to mutate the array of data we will have in the &lt;code&gt;animeTitles&lt;/code&gt; atom by slicing the array to return only 50 items at a time based on the page number which we will get from &lt;code&gt;animePageNum&lt;/code&gt; atom.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;slicedAnimeTitles&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;slicedAnimeTitles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;animes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;animeTitles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pageNum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;animeListPageNum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;newAnimeList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;animes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arrIndex&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pageNum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pageNum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;newAnimeList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;splice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arrIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Above, we created a selector called &lt;code&gt;slicedAnimeTitles&lt;/code&gt;, we defined a &lt;code&gt;key&lt;/code&gt; property just like we did in the atoms we created above, and here we have a new property &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; whose value is a function, this is only available in selectors, this function has 2 parameters but here we are using just one of them that is &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; with which we can access the value of an atom or selector. Inside this function, with the &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; method, we saved the &lt;code&gt;animeTitles&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;animeListPageNum&lt;/code&gt; atoms into 2 variables &lt;code&gt;animes&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;pageNum&lt;/code&gt; respectively, and with the &lt;code&gt;pageNum&lt;/code&gt; we specified the index to start slicing from and then returned a new array of just 50 items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have now successfully created all the shared states we will be using in this app. Next. Let’s create a pagination component, to handle user click and update the animeListPageNum state (atom) so we can update the list of animes we are returning from the selector we just created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#building-pagination-component"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Building Pagination Component
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin, navigate to &lt;code&gt;src/components&lt;/code&gt; and create a new folder &lt;code&gt;Pagination&lt;/code&gt;, inside it create a file &lt;code&gt;Pagination.jsx&lt;/code&gt;, paste the code below into this file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useRecoilState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;recoil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;styled&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;styled-components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;animeListPageNum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../../store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Pagination&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;listLength&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;pageNum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setPageNum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useRecoilState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;animeListPageNum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;numsArr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setNumsArr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([]);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Above, we created a new component &lt;code&gt;Pagination&lt;/code&gt;. This component has a prop &lt;code&gt;listLength&lt;/code&gt;; this will help us determine the page numbers to render. We then imported &lt;code&gt;[useRecoilState](https://recoiljs.org/docs/api-reference/core/useRecoilState)&lt;/code&gt;, which accepts a state as an argument just like React’s useState hook, This also works similar to &lt;code&gt;useSelector&lt;/code&gt;  in Redux But here we can update the state directly and not have to dispatch an action. We can access the value of the state passed to &lt;code&gt;useRecoilState&lt;/code&gt; and also update the state, We also created a component state with &lt;code&gt;useState&lt;/code&gt; hook to hold an array of numbers, these will be the page numbers to render in this component.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;paginationNums&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;max&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;floor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;listLength&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nums&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[];&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nums&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;max&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setNumsArr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nums&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;paginationNums&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;listLength&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;StyledPagination&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;numsArr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;numsArr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;pageNum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;active&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setPageNum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/StyledPagination&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the useEffect we imported above, we created an array of numbers with the &lt;code&gt;listLength&lt;/code&gt; prop, and updated the &lt;code&gt;numArr&lt;/code&gt; state with the array we created and then we looped through the array of nums and rendered them in buttons, each button will update the &lt;code&gt;animeListPageNum&lt;/code&gt; when clicked. Let’s complete this component by adding  the code below.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;StyledPagination&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;styled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  border-width: 2px 2px 2px 0;
  border-style: solid;
  width: max-content;
  &amp;amp; button {
    outline: none;
    background: transparent;
    border: none;
    border-left: 2px solid;
    width: 35px;
    height: 30px;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    &amp;amp;:hover,
    &amp;amp;.active {
      background: #fae1da;
    }
  }
`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Pagination&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;code&gt;Pagination&lt;/code&gt; component done, we can now build our app pages and complete the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#building-homepage-component"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Building Homepage Component
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section, we will build our &lt;code&gt;homepage&lt;/code&gt; component, this page will render a static quote and also a list of animes using the &lt;code&gt;AnimePill&lt;/code&gt; component we created earlier and also the &lt;code&gt;Pagination&lt;/code&gt; component for pagination. To do this, in our &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; folder let’s create a folder called &lt;code&gt;pages&lt;/code&gt;, in this folder create a folder called &lt;code&gt;home&lt;/code&gt; and a file inside it called &lt;code&gt;index.jsx&lt;/code&gt;, folder path should &lt;code&gt;src/pages/home/index.jsx&lt;/code&gt;. Add the code below to this file&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useRecoilValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;recoil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;styled&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;styled-components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AnimePill&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../../components/AnimePill/AnimePill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Pagination&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../../components/Pagination/Pagination&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Quote&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../../components/Quote/Quote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;slicedAnimeTitles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;animeTitles&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../../store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Homepage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Anime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Quote&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Generator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;

        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Homepage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Above, we imported: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;useRecoilValue&lt;/code&gt; from the Recoil library to get the state values,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;styled&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;styled-components&lt;/code&gt; to style the &lt;code&gt;Homepage&lt;/code&gt; component, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;AnimePill&lt;/code&gt; to render anime title, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Pagination&lt;/code&gt; to handle pagination, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Quote&lt;/code&gt;  to display a static anime quote,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;SlicedAnimeTitles&lt;/code&gt; is the selector we created earlier. We will be its return value on this page, and &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;animeTitles&lt;/code&gt; which is the first atom we created to hold the list of animes. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we created a function component called &lt;code&gt;Homepage&lt;/code&gt; inside this component, we accessed the &lt;code&gt;animeTitles&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;slicedAnimeTitles&lt;/code&gt; state using &lt;code&gt;useRecoilvalue&lt;/code&gt; and also we created an array of colors (we will pass these colors to the &lt;code&gt;AnimePill&lt;/code&gt; component at random). We then created a function &lt;code&gt;generateColor&lt;/code&gt;, this component returns a random color from the colors array. After that, we returned the component body styled with &lt;code&gt;styled-components&lt;/code&gt;, a header, the &lt;code&gt;Quote&lt;/code&gt;  component, and a little notice telling a user what to do, then if we have &lt;code&gt;animes&lt;/code&gt;, we will loop through the &lt;code&gt;slicedAnimes&lt;/code&gt; and render each of them with the &lt;code&gt;AnimePill&lt;/code&gt; component by passing the anime to the component and also a color prop from the &lt;code&gt;generateColor&lt;/code&gt; function and if there’s none we render a ‘no data’ state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Next, we are checking to see if the length of the &lt;code&gt;animes&lt;/code&gt; state is more than 50, if true we render the &lt;code&gt;Pagination&lt;/code&gt; component. and finally, we added a block of &lt;code&gt;styled-component&lt;/code&gt; styles&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve now successfully created our &lt;code&gt;Homepage&lt;/code&gt; component, in the next section let’s create a page we will be routed to when we click on any &lt;code&gt;AnimePill&lt;/code&gt;. In that component, we will make an API call to the external API and fetch all quotes from the selected anime and render the quotes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s get started by navigating to our &lt;code&gt;pages&lt;/code&gt; folder, inside create a folder called &lt;code&gt;anime&lt;/code&gt; and a file inside it called &lt;code&gt;index.jsx&lt;/code&gt;. Add the code below to the file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useParams&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react-router-dom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;axios&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;axios&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;styled&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;styled-components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;SmallQuote&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../../components/SmallQuote/SmallQuote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Animepage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;param&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useParams&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;quotes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setQuotes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([]);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;loading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setLoading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;param&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetchAnimeQuotes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;axios&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`https://animechan.vercel.app/api/quotes/anime?title=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;param&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setQuotes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setLoading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setLoading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetchAnimeQuotes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;param&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;StyledAnimePage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Quotes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;param&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Go&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;back&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;grid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;loading&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Loading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;quotes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;quotes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;quote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;quote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;quote&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;anime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;SmallQuote&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nx"&gt;anime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;quote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;anime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nx"&gt;character&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;quote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;character&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nx"&gt;quote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;quote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;quote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;            &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;nodata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;No&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Quote&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;found&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;😞&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="p"&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/StyledAnimePage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;StyledAnimePage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;styled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`
  max-width: 80%;
  margin: 2rem auto;
  position: relative;
  &amp;amp; &amp;gt; a {
    position: absolute;
    top: 1rem;
    text-decoration: none;
  }
  &amp;amp; &amp;gt; h2 {
    font-weight: 400;
    letter-spacing: 3px;
    text-align: center;
    margin-bottom: 2rem;
  }
  &amp;amp; &amp;gt; .grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
    grid-template-rows: max-content;
    &amp;amp; .anime {
      margin: 1rem;
      height: max-content;
    }
    &amp;amp; &amp;gt; p {
      margin: 2rem 0 4rem;
      font-size: 1.3rem;
      text-align: center;
    }
  }
`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Animepage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Above, we imported all the components and hooks we will be using. We also initialized the &lt;code&gt;[useParams](https://reactrouter.com/web/api/Hooks/useparams.)&lt;/code&gt; hook, to get an anime title from our browser URL as a param based on the route we’ll define for this page. Next, we created 2 component states using &lt;code&gt;useState&lt;/code&gt; hook, one to hold the quotes we will fetch from the API and the other for a loading, And in a &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt;, we are fetching the quotes based on the anime name gotten from the URL and setting the &lt;code&gt;quotes&lt;/code&gt; state with it. We then returned a block of jsx styled with &lt;code&gt;styled-components&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above, you’ll notice that we didn’t use Recoil, instead, we saved the response we got from the API request in a &lt;code&gt;useState&lt;/code&gt;, this is because the states will only be used in this component.&lt;/p&gt;

  Open Source Session Replay
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debugging a web application in production may be challenging and time-consuming. &lt;a href="https://github.com/openreplay/openreplay"&gt;OpenReplay&lt;/a&gt; is an Open-source alternative to FullStory, LogRocket and Hotjar. It allows you to monitor and replay everything your users do and shows how your app behaves for every issue. &lt;br&gt;
It’s like having your browser’s inspector open while looking over your user’s shoulder.&lt;br&gt;
OpenReplay is the only open-source alternative currently available.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating App Routes and Fetching Animes
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To complete this app, Let’s navigate to &lt;code&gt;src/App.js&lt;/code&gt;. Here, we will be doing 2 things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fetch a list of animes from the external API and updating the &lt;code&gt;animeTitles&lt;/code&gt;  atom we created earlier with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define our app routes with &lt;code&gt;react-router-dom&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s get started. Go to  &lt;code&gt;src/App.js&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;replace&lt;/strong&gt; what we have there with the code below.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;BrowserRouter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Switch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react-router-dom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useSetRecoilState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;recoil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;axios&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;axios&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;animeTitles&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Homepage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./pages/home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Animepage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./pages/anime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Above, We imported&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; - We will be making our API call inside it, so that we can fetch the array of anime once the page is rendered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;BrowserRouter&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Route&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Switch&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;react-router-dom&lt;/code&gt;  - We will create our routes with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;[useSetRecoilState](https://recoiljs.org/docs/api-reference/core/useSetRecoilState)&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;recoil&lt;/code&gt; - with this, we will update the &lt;code&gt;animeTitles&lt;/code&gt; atom just by passing the atom to it as an argument, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;axios&lt;/code&gt; - for fetching data from the external API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we will create the App component and fetch the animes inside. To do that add the code below.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTitles&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useSetRecoilState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;animeTitles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetchAnimes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;axios&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;https://animechan.vercel.app/api/available/anime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTitles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetchAnimes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Above, we created the App component, and inside we created a variable &lt;code&gt;setTitles&lt;/code&gt; with which we will update our &lt;code&gt;animeTitles&lt;/code&gt; atom (state). Next, we created an async function called &lt;code&gt;fetchAnimes&lt;/code&gt;, inside it, we fetched the animes from the external API using axios and updated our &lt;code&gt;animeTitles&lt;/code&gt; state with it while using &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch"&gt;try-catch&lt;/a&gt; for error handling. After that we called the &lt;code&gt;fetchAnimes&lt;/code&gt; inside the &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; we imported so this function runs once the page is rendered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s finish up the &lt;code&gt;App&lt;/code&gt; component by adding routes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;BrowserRouter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Switch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;exact&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Homepage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;exact&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/anime/:name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Animepage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Switch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/BrowserRouter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We have now completed our app. let’s start our dev server to see how it works. &lt;br&gt;
Run the command below in your terminal&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn start
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OR&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm start
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you followed along correctly, you should see these pages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---2SqUsnQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/k34w48hyexsdxibknznp.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---2SqUsnQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/k34w48hyexsdxibknznp.png" alt="localhost:3000 - homepage"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on any anime and see a page like this. I will click on Naruto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--aK_dpsFL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vxod82djlyt81jhzx7tr.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--aK_dpsFL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vxod82djlyt81jhzx7tr.png" alt="anime page showing quotes from Naruto"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we learned what Recoil is, why use it, and how to use it instead of Redux by building an anime-quote-generator app using Recoil for state management. We also compared how to do certain things in Recoil to Redux, and we saw how easy it is to use Recoil. You can learn more about Recoil from the official docs. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Batemos a meta do NPS! Como foi?</title>
      <author>Anderson Poli</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 18:34:01 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/convenia/batemos-a-meta-do-nps-e-agora-4cnk</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/convenia/batemos-a-meta-do-nps-e-agora-4cnk</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Antes de mais nada o que é NPS?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O Net Promoter Score (NPS) é uma métrica de lealdade do cliente criada por Fred Heichheld, com o objetivo de medir o grau de lealdade dos clientes das empresas de qualquer segmento, trazendo reflexos da experiência e satisfação dos clientes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resumidamente é uma pesquisa feita com os clientes perguntando de 0 a 10 qual seria a probabilidade deles recomendarem o seu produto para outras pessoas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As notas são divididas da seguinte maneira.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;0 - 6: Detratores&lt;br&gt;
7 - 8: Neutros&lt;br&gt;
9 - 10: Promotores&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imaginem um grupo de amigos em uma mesa de bar, quando o assunto do momento é relacionado a algum produto que resolva determinado problema, e o seu produto é levantado como opção.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Detratores são aqueles que não irão recomendar por N motivos, ou por um pequeno motivo mas que para ele é importante.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neutros ficarão em cima do muro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Promotores recomendarão fortemente o produto, dando exemplos de problemas solucionados.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acho NPS uma forma de medir muito ingrata, a conta para saber se você está em uma zona de excelência não é ter mais promotores do que detratores somente. Um detrator pesa bem mais que um promotor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Por exemplo: em uma pesquisa com 50 pessoas respostas, 25 deram notas 9 e 10 (promotores), 20 deram notas 7 ou 8 (neutros) e 5 deram notas de 0 a 6 (detratores). O cálculo de NPS deve ser: 25 (promotores) – 5 (detratores) ÷ 50 (número total de pessoas que responderam) = 40%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seu produto só começa a entrar na zona de excelência após ultrapassar a barreira de 50.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E aqui começa o nosso post =)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aqui na Convenia, alinhamos como meta do time de produto atingir o NPS acima da zona de excelência. E sabíamos que não seria tarefa fácil, por ser um SAAS, com diversos tipos de clientes, setores etc..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pelo título do post, já temos um spoiler que conseguimos alcançar nosso objetivo durante o ano, mas o que quero passar aqui é, quais foram as principais ações para que isso se tornasse realidade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 - Alinhamento com time de vendas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Sabemos que um vendedor quer vender a qualquer custo, não está errado, mas uma mudança clara foi saber vender a qualquer custo sabendo das limitações e das qualidades do produto. Normal em um time em crescimento ter desalinhamento em relação ao que o produto é capaz de fazer. Por conta disso foi importantíssimo reuniões de alinhamento com o time de vendas e produto constantes, para sanar dúvidas ou sugerir evoluções.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 - Alinhamento com o time de CS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
CS tem papel fundamental de fazer com que o cliente chegue no sucesso esperado utilizando o sistema. E como fazer isso? &lt;br&gt;
Pensando fora da caixa, e porque não sugerir melhorias no produto, seja no processo de implantação para reduzir tempo gasto em alguma tarefa entregando valor mais rápido, ajudando a realizar pesquisas com clientes para entender quais são as principais dúvidas e demandas. Afinal CS é quem mais passa o tempo se relacionando com os clientes. Ter um time de CS integrado com o time de produto foi essencial, onde cada um entendeu a limitação de cada área.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 - Produto atacando o que realmente importa&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Aqui na Convenia temos um processo bem definido de priorização, escrevi sobre o tema a um tempo atrás: &lt;a href="https://dev.to/convenia/o-que-atacar-em-produto-user-impact-score-pode-te-ajudar-a-comecar-5a8j"&gt;https://dev.to/convenia/o-que-atacar-em-produto-user-impact-score-pode-te-ajudar-a-comecar-5a8j&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tendo um processo alinhado com a estratégia da empresa, o que precisa ser feito é executar!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No momento que adiciono como tag do post a palavra alinhamento&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Por que esse foi o principal motivo da chegada a meta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time de design pensando na melhor usabilidade, como resolver um problema da maneira mais fácil e ágil possível. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time de engenharia focado em entregar valor rápido, não menosprezando qualidade e segurança.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mais e ai, qual foi o NPS alcançado?&lt;br&gt;
Durante todo o ano batíamos na trave, 45, 48, 43, até 49, lembra quando falei que NPS era ingrato, teve um mês que no último dia o sonho foi postergado, o time sofreu! E isso é muito legal, fomos mais fortes para a próxima rodada, até que alcançamos o 62.2. BOOOM!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foi hora de comemorar, e entender que o trabalho apenas começou, pois chegar é difícil, se manter é muito mais. Sabemos que no próximo mês o resultado pode não ser tão bom, mas confiar no processo é essencial para isso se tornar um padrão.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Create your own React icons library and publish to npm automatically</title>
      <author>Quan Pham</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 18:33:16 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/quanpham/create-your-own-react-icons-library-and-publish-to-npm-automatically-4i11</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/quanpham/create-your-own-react-icons-library-and-publish-to-npm-automatically-4i11</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cover photo by &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/@aquatium"&gt;Harpal Singh&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/_zKxPsGOGKg"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have a set of SVG icons in your React project. And you want to separate them out from your current codebase, make them a standalone library so you can reuse these icons later in another projects. This tutorial of mine can help you easily create your own icon library and &lt;em&gt;automatically&lt;/em&gt; publish it to the &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/"&gt;npm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fact: I’ve learnt this from watching &lt;a href="https://github.com/tailwindlabs/heroicons"&gt;tailwindlabs/heroicons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TLDR: If you want to skip this post and want to check the final work instead, please click here &lt;a href="https://github.com/mikunpham/react-icon-boilerplate"&gt;react-icon-boilerplate&lt;/a&gt;. Feel free to clone my repo and create you own lib.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setup
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you create an empty folder and initialize a new &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;mkdir &lt;/span&gt;react-icons-boilerplate &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;react-icons-boilerplate
yarn init &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-y&lt;/span&gt;
yarn add &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-D&lt;/span&gt; svgo rimraf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We will use &lt;a href="https://github.com/svg/svgo"&gt;svgo&lt;/a&gt; to optimize our SVG icon files since:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SVG files, especially those exported from various editors, usually contain a lot of redundant and useless information. This can include editor metadata, comments, hidden elements, default or non-optimal values and other stuff that can be safely removed or converted without affecting the SVG rendering result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You create a &lt;code&gt;raw&lt;/code&gt; folder which contains all your SVG icon files that need to be optimized.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;mkdir &lt;/span&gt;raw
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is my SVG sample file, I will place it in the raw folder &lt;code&gt;raw/plus-outline.svg&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;svg width="24px" height="24px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;CC3942F2-90B2-4E94-AADC-715CECF64617&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;defs&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;rect id="path-1" x="0" y="0" width="24" height="24"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/rect&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/defs&amp;gt;

        &amp;lt;/g&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/g&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/svg&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It does looks really long and noisy. Let’s optimize it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#optimize-svg-files"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Optimize SVG files
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To easily run &lt;code&gt;svgo&lt;/code&gt; command with some options, you add a script into the &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; like below. Every time you run the command, it will re-create a folder named &lt;code&gt;optimized&lt;/code&gt; which contains all icons that are optimized from the &lt;code&gt;raw&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"react-icons-boilerplate"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"version"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"1.0.0"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"main"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"index.js"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"license"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"MIT"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"scripts"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"optimize"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"rimraf ./optimized &amp;amp; svgo -q -p 8 -f ./raw -o ./optimized"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"devDependencies"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"rimraf"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"^3.0.2"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"svgo"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"^2.6.1"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can run &lt;code&gt;yarn optimize&lt;/code&gt; to see the result. Also, you need to have a svgo configuration file in order to add as many plugins as possible that help us to clear  all the redundant data. Here is my &lt;code&gt;svgo.config.js&lt;/code&gt; for example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;multipass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;js2svg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;indent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;pretty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;plugins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;preset-default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;sortAttrs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;removeScriptElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;removeDimensions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;removeScriptElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;removeDimensions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before come up with these plugins, I tried to mess around on this website &lt;a href="https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/"&gt;SVGOMG - SVGO’s Missing GUI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my optimized &lt;a href="https://github.com/mikunpham/react-icon-boilerplate/blob/main/optimized/plus-outline.svg"&gt;result file&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#build-react-icons"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Build React icons
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need some packages in order to transform our SVG files into React SVG components and then convert JSX syntax into &lt;em&gt;CJS&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;ESM&lt;/em&gt; module format. We use &lt;a href="https://babeljs.io/"&gt;babel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://react-svgr.com/"&gt;svgr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn add &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-D&lt;/span&gt; @babel/core @babel/preset-react @svgr/cli @svgr/core camelcase terser
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You get this build script from here: &lt;a href="https://github.com/mikunpham/react-icon-boilerplate/blob/main/scripts/build.js"&gt;script/build.js&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, this script read the &lt;code&gt;optimize&lt;/code&gt; folder, get all icons and convert them into JSX by using &lt;code&gt;svgr&lt;/code&gt; and then transform the React code into &lt;em&gt;CJS&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;ESM&lt;/em&gt; module format by &lt;code&gt;babel&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original icon filename will become the component’s name in CamelCase plus suffix &lt;code&gt;Icon&lt;/code&gt;. For example with &lt;code&gt;plus-outline.svg&lt;/code&gt; file we will have component name &lt;code&gt;PlusOutlineIcon&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The package supports for Typescript by generate a declare file &lt;code&gt;.d.ts&lt;/code&gt; for each icons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the usage of the icon component when the packages is installed and used by other project&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PlusOutlineIcon&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;react-icons-boilerplate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since this build script I created to fit my icons set so these line are little special, but you can change them to fit yours icons set.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// line 12 to 23&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;svgReactContent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;svgr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;icon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;replaceAttrValues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;#00497A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;{props.color || '#00497A'}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;svgProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;componentName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, we add this build script to our &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"scripts"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"optimize"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"rimraf ./optimized &amp;amp; svgo -q -p 8 -f ./raw -o ./optimized"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"build"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"yarn optimize &amp;amp;&amp;amp; node scripts/build.js"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you run &lt;code&gt;yarn build&lt;/code&gt; you will have a &lt;code&gt;dist&lt;/code&gt; folder as the result. You see something similar to this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xp-dLwL4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4wt1kq9khqax6r1ttzcz.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xp-dLwL4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4wt1kq9khqax6r1ttzcz.png" alt="3539DB0D-179B-46AA-9BB7-2AD78351EB80"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And don’t forget to add these lines in your &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; before publishing it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"main"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"./dist/cjs/index.js"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"module"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"./dist/esm/index.js"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"files"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"dist"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#git"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Git
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can push all your work to your GitHub repository. I won’t go through this since I assume we all know how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#publish"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Publish
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have the final &lt;code&gt;dist&lt;/code&gt; folder as the result now you can publish this to npm.&lt;br&gt;
It can be easily done by login into the npm account via NPM CLI &lt;code&gt;npm login&lt;/code&gt; and run the &lt;code&gt;npm publish --access public&lt;/code&gt; after that. But I want to leverage &lt;a href="https://github.com/features/actions"&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/atlassian/changesets"&gt;atlassian/changesets&lt;/a&gt; to do this automatically for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#changesets"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  changesets
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To install and init &lt;code&gt;changesets&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn add &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-D&lt;/span&gt; @changesets/cli @changesets/changelog-github
yarn changeset init
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You will have &lt;code&gt;.changeset&lt;/code&gt; folder and its configuration file &lt;code&gt;config.json&lt;/code&gt; inside. Here is my config:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"$schema"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"https://unpkg.com/@changesets/config@1.6.1/schema.json"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"changelog"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"@changesets/changelog-github"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"repo"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"mikunpham/react-icon-example"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"commit"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"linked"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"access"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"restrict"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"baseBranch"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"main"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"updateInternalDependencies"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"patch"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"ignore"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you want to publish your package as a &lt;em&gt;public&lt;/em&gt; package, you have to change the “access” property from &lt;strong&gt;restricted&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;public&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first release, you have to run &lt;code&gt;yarn changeset&lt;/code&gt;. It will ask what kind of &lt;a href="https://semver.org/"&gt;Semantic Versioning&lt;/a&gt; you want to bump your package and write a short summary about it. It will create something like this and you now can commit this file to your repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AuSPgyWW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n111dxpvih3flzt4khbc.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AuSPgyWW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n111dxpvih3flzt4khbc.png" alt="86BDEFE4-2AF0-4599-84DF-58E441E81FCD"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#github-release-action"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  GitHub Release Action
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;changesets&lt;/code&gt; has a very detailed instruction to implement their action into your GitHub workflows here &lt;a href="https://github.com/changesets/action"&gt;https://github.com/changesets/action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Or you can get my &lt;code&gt;release.yml&lt;/code&gt; here &lt;a href="https://github.com/mikunpham/react-icon-boilerplate/tree/main/.github/workflows"&gt;release.yml&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, commit everything and push onto Github.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If everything is OK, a &lt;code&gt;github-action&lt;/code&gt; bot will create a PR just like this and wait for you to merge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WmOi1zA2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xkwm1r6x78boesn3uuty.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WmOi1zA2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xkwm1r6x78boesn3uuty.png" alt="45043714-16A2-4DA1-B4F4-C07276FA1885"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After merging, a release will be created&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3O7078Yy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ik34ya67jgtymkmyfsw6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3O7078Yy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ik34ya67jgtymkmyfsw6.png" alt="22E81BD3-5302-465D-A6E0-BFA0756296EF"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And go check your &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-icons-boilerplate"&gt;npm now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--W-CU8WrY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tmys8auwim6p7tvfos9r.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--W-CU8WrY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tmys8auwim6p7tvfos9r.png" alt="8BAF8198-D4BE-4882-B2F7-66EE9973889D"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#whats-next"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What’s next
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From now, whenever you have new icons, do these following step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add them to the &lt;code&gt;raw&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn build&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;yarn changeset&lt;/code&gt; , select major/minor/patch bump and write summary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profit!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#final"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Final
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very &lt;em&gt;long long&lt;/em&gt; post huh? &lt;em&gt;BUT&lt;/em&gt; it just takes you 30’ max to get everything up and run for the first time and mostly 2-3’ to add new icons and release new version after that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you all the contributors of &lt;code&gt;babel&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;svgo&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;svgr&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;changesets&lt;/code&gt; for making our dev life easier than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  Thank you for reading till the end 🎉
