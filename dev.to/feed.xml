  Hey there!!
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm starting to learn a bit more about design, and wanted to do some challenges to put into practice what I'm learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first challenge I had to design and code a password generator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check it &lt;a href="https://pass-genny.vercel.app/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Or take a look on github:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Boyd: The Fighter Pilot Who Changed the Art of War by Robert Coram</title>
      <author>Sandor Dargo</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 31 Jul 2021 15:27:14 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/sandordargo/boyd-the-fighter-pilot-who-changed-the-art-of-war-by-robert-coram-269h</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/sandordargo/boyd-the-fighter-pilot-who-changed-the-art-of-war-by-robert-coram-269h</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FA5UEG/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=sandordargo-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B000FA5UEG&amp;amp;linkId=daed4d37e8c6b25dcf494239369ec82a"&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt; in the monthly reading list I receive from &lt;a href="https://ryanholiday.net/reading-newsletter/"&gt;Ryan Holiday&lt;/a&gt;. I was not sure what the biography of a fighter pilot would offer to me, but the subtitle of the book is &lt;em&gt;The Fighter Pilot Who Changed the Art of War&lt;/em&gt;. A fighter pilot, who made a difference way beyond his field. That must be interesting. I cannot express with words how fascinating his story is. If I just think about this book, I feel thrilled deep in my bones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have read many good books, but I feel that this one have a deep impact on my life, on my work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tragical-family-life"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tragical family life
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is some tragedy in this book, in Boyd's life. He came from a family of 5 children. They were not poor when he was born in 1927, in Erie, Pennsylvania. Sadly, Boyd's father passed away early and that left them in serious trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't want to list all the ill conditions that he encountered among his siblings or later his children, I only want to mention one dreadful illness, polio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are so lucky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are so lucky to have modern medicine, to have vaccines and we don't have to worry about such terrible illnesses as polio. Of course, there are still many terrible conditions, but there are so many which are either curable or preventable with a damn vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boyd's life also cannot be put into context without the effects of polio. Obviously, having a sister with polio affected him deeply. But having his first-born son catching polio changed his life even more as he based some of his career moves based the vicinity of treatment for his son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you might think that Colonel John Boyd must have been a great father, but that's the complete opposite of the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He achieved so much in his life, he was probably the best fighter pilot at least of his era, but arguably the one with the biggest effects of all time. He fought the bureaucracy of the Air Force, of the Pentagon, changed the science of aviation, he contributed so much to the F15 and even more to the F16 and even to the F18. Oh and he even contributed to how to fight a war in general. The Marines can also thank him a lot, and we haven't mentioned that the extremely effective strategy of Operation Desert Storm was coming from him as Dick Cheney relied on him, the retired strategist. The Desert Storm had one failure, right at the point where a certain general didn't dare to do what was requested. Anyways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Boyd was a terrible father who didn't care enough. The Washington DC apartment where they spent more than 2 decades was close to the Pentagon, but it was small and the neighbourhood was degrading. Once, Boyd was promoted to colonel, they would have had the money, but he didn't care to move his family to a better place. He was called the Ghetto Colonel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once he retired from the Air Force, they didn't have much money, but that's only because Boyd worked for free, he gave lectures all around the states only for the travel costs, but he often forgot to cash in the checks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On his deathbed, he was barely talking about his family, but mostly about his colleagues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No big surprise that when his time was approaching his family couldn't get prepared for the 15-minute drive to the hospital. He spent his last hours with her favourite daughter Mary Ellen. Of course, he said on his deathbed that he loved her, he loved his children. It was not that much welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use it as a memento. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you express your feelings only on your deathbed, it is way too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#boyd-and-his-heritage"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Boyd and his heritage
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people with great effects on history were such bad parents. Boyd is one of them. Now let's talk about how he changed the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Korean War, he was invited to attend the Fighter Weapon School in Nellis and then he stayed there as an instructor. He got the nickname "40 second Boyd". He said that anyone could start a dogfight from his six and in 40 seconds they would be hosed. Many tried, nobody succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There he wrote the first air fighter tactics manual which became The Bible of the fighters. Later he developed some new theories called the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy%E2%80%93maneuverability_theory"&gt;Energy–maneuverability theory&lt;/a&gt; which first helped to work out tactics against - superior - enemy aircrafts and later to design new ones. Boyd had great influence over the design of F15, F16 and F18 aircrafts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He never stopped researching, there was always something on his mind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#rubber-ducks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Rubber ducks
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What never changed was his late-night or even early-morning (for him, very late night) phone calls. He had an idea, a "breakthrough" and he called his "Acolytes", his faithful followers - no matter when. Probably he didn't even realize it was 1 AM or even 4 AM. Or he just didn't care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These late-night phone calls were often not discussions, but monologues. He shared his thoughts, he listened to himself and then he found the missing points and went on working. Essentially he used the others as his &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging"&gt;rubber ducks&lt;/a&gt;. Is that familiar to you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We explain to our peers our coding problems, concerns, possible solutions and one in the middle, or maybe right after, we have the "aha!" moment. While we might think we seek help, but in reality, we just want to synthesize our thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably that's what Boyd was looking for as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference is that his thoughts were more revolutionary than those of an average software developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apropos, software development...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#boyd-and-scrum"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Boyd and Scrum
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I wrote a &lt;a href="https://devreads.sandordargo.com/scrum-by-jeff-sutherland/"&gt;book review about Jeff Sutherland's Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He wrote about the OODA loop, a principle of 4 elements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Observe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orient&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Act&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So no, it's not about Object-Oriented Design Applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sutherland learned about the loop in the army as a fighter pilot and he considers it saved his life. It's basically the blueprint of our decision-making process. It was taught for making time-sensitive decisions when both time and information are scarce. The idea is that you try to get inside the decision loop of your opponents and you became the one who leads the events so that you disrupt their decision cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technique is now also widely used in the business world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Scrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And guess what. The OODA loop was developed by Colonel John Boyd. We'll learn more about it in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#schwerpunkt"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Schwerpunkt
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little detour, before I explain the above German word. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, after his retirement he also worked with the marines and with the army so that they can rebuild their doctrines. During the first half of the 80s, he frequently met a certain general from the Army, Brigadier General Huba Wass de Czege. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I read his name, I was astonished. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was staring at the name and said, it cannot be a coincidence. And it is not. He is considered a highly innovative thinker, a military strategist. When the US Army tried to redefine its goals and strategies, at the beginning of the 80s, he was working on the new doctrines. And he is indeed the son of the important 20th-century Hungarian author, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Wass"&gt;Albert Wass&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His story confirms that having the right upbringing is more important than being rich. While this general was born into a rich family, they clearly lost everything. Their wealth, their home, their country, their mountains, yet with grit and the right education the family survived and has served their new home with pride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the last item, the last concept, I wanted to mention from [the book] is &lt;em&gt;schwerpunkt&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schwerpunkt&lt;/em&gt; is something known and used in the German army since the 19th century in order to make the right decisions regarding priorities. It's an expression that is difficult to translate, one might call it the centre of gravity, the focal point, or the point of main effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's about knowing what is the most important for an organization, an army, at a given point in time and why that is the most important. Each and every unit must keep that in their mind and support that point of main effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think about the overwhelming efficiency of blitzkrieg, the schwerpunkt was to concentrate on one point of the enemy frontline, instead of battling the whole enemy. All the units knew what their goal was, where they had to break through the lines and then surround the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an organization has a &lt;em&gt;schwerpunkt&lt;/em&gt;, it can make a huge difference. Instead of taking one step into a hundred directions and reaching nowhere, the organization can make those hundred steps into one direction and attain great success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not only true for organizations, but also for individuals. Furthermore, it's not only valid for big strategic goals, but also for tactical ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing your most important goal at a time and concentrate your resources on that can make the difference between average and success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not a coincidence that Peter Drucker said that if you have more than 5 goals at a time, you have none. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not a coincidence that Benjamin P Hardy doesn't suggest having long to-do lists, but to set no more than 3 goals for a day, for a week or a quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to know where you want to go and you cannot go everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Know your &lt;em&gt;schwerpunkt&lt;/em&gt; and become unstoppable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boyd kept telling his associates that one has to choose between being someone and doing something. It was his famous "to be or to do" speech. He never became a general, but his results, his legacy are still with us, not even in the military but in the business world too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He clearly decided &lt;em&gt;to do&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He could have been court-martialed at least a dozen times, he was threatened to be fired, to be relocated, yet he had ever-lasting effects fighter tactics, aeroplane design, military and even business strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got highly interested in some of his concepts, so you'll read about his name in the future on this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FA5UEG/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=sandordargo-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B000FA5UEG&amp;amp;linkId=daed4d37e8c6b25dcf494239369ec82a"&gt;A highly recommended read!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>All you need to know about arrays in JavaScript</title>

  &lt;a href="#arrays-in-javascript"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Arrays in JavaScript
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In JavaScript, arrays are used to store multiple values or you can think of an array as an ordered list of values (more specific elements).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike Java or C++ in JavaScript, an array can store values of different data types and you also don't need to specify the size of array while declaring it as it can grow automatically as per requirement or you can say length of array is dynamically sized and auto-growing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Java&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;CPP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;3.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Output [1, "Java", 2, "CPP", 3, "JS", 3.5, "HTML"]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In JavaScript arrays are special type of objects, but let's not worry about that much and treat it as normal array for now&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Java&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;CPP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;3.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arrayObj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Output "object"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ways-of-creating-an-array-in-javascript"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Ways of creating an array in JavaScript
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In JavaScript, you can create arrays in two ways, one via JavaScript keyword i.e., &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;Array Constructor&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and the another way is via &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;array literals&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;(Easiest and most preferred way)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-creating-array-via-array-constructor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Creating array via Array Constructor:
&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arrayObj&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arrayObj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Output [1, 2, 3, 4, "Red"]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-the-preferred-way-to-create-an-array-is-to-use-the-array-literal-notation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. The preferred way to create an array is to use the array literal notation:
&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Java&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;CPP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;3.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Output [1, "Java", 2, "CPP", 3, "JS", 3.5, "HTML"]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#accessing-the-array-elements"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Accessing the array elements
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In JavaScript, arrays are zero-indexed which means the first element of an array is at index 0, and the last element is at the index value of arrays length minus 1.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Java&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;CPP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;3.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// length of array = 8&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Output  1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Output  2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Output  "CPP"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Output  3.5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Output  "HTML"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Output  undefined &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#length-property-of-array"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Length property of Array
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The length property sets or returns the number of elements in an array&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Delhi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;London&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;New York&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Mexico City&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Length of cities Array is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Output "Length of cities Array is 7"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;countryCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;001&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;002&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;003&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;004&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;005&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;countryCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Length of countryCode Array is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;countryCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Output "Length of countryCode Array is 3"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;CountryCode Array after setting size to 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;countryCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Output "CountryCode Array after setting size to 3",  ["001", "002", "003"]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lets-learn-some-important-methods-of-array-in-javascript"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Let's learn some important methods of array in JavaScript
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-push"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. push()
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The push() method adds new elements to the end of an array.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Delhi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;London&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;New York&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Output ["Delhi", "Mumbai", "Los Angeles", "London", "New York"]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-pop"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. pop()
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pop() method removes the last element of an array, and returns that element.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Delhi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;London&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;pop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Output "London"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Output ["Delhi", "Mumbai", "Los Angeles"]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-concat"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. concat()
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concat() method is used to join two or more arrays.&lt;br&gt;
This method does not change the existing arrays, but returns a new array, containing the values of the joined arrays.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Delhi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;London&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Pune&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Kolkata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Moscow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Output ["Delhi", "Mumbai", "Los Angeles", "London", "Pune", "Kolkata", "Moscow"]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-slice"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. slice()
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slice() method takes two arguments as starting index and ending index and returns the new array object selecting the elements from starting index to ending index(excluding end index).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;Syntax&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;slice(startIndex,endIndex)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Delhi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;London&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Pune&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;silceCities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;slice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;silceCities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Output ["Mumbai", "Los Angeles", "London"]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-splice"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. splice()
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The splice() method adds/removes items to/from an array, &lt;br&gt;
and returns the removed item(s).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;Syntax&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;splice(start)&lt;br&gt;
splice(start, deleteCount)&lt;br&gt;
splice(start, deleteCount, item1....)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Delhi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;London&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;splice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Output ["Mumbai", "Los Angeles"]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Output ["Delhi", "London"]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;splice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;London&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Output ["Delhi", "Mumbai", "Los Angeles", "London", "London"]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-tostring"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. toString()
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The toString() method returns a string with all the array values, separated by commas.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Delhi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;London&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Output "Delhi,Mumbai,Los Angeles,London"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#7-sort"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  7. sort()
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sort() method sorts the items of an array.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Delhi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;London&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Output ["Delhi", "London", "Los Angeles", "Mumbai"]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#8-reverse"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  8. reverse()
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reverse() method reverses the order of the elements in an array.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Delhi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;London&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reverse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Output ["London", "Los Angeles", "Mumbai", "Delhi"]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#9-indexof"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  9. indexOf()
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The indexOf() method searches the array for the specified element, and returns its position.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Delhi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;London&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;indexOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;London&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;pos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Output 3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similar to &lt;code&gt;indexOf()&lt;/code&gt; there is another method &lt;code&gt;lastIndexOf()&lt;/code&gt; as the name suggest, it returns the index of last occurence of the element in an array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#10-isarray"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  10. isArray()
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The isArray() method determines whether an object is an array. This returns true if the object is an array, and false if not.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Delhi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;London&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Output true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#11-includes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  11. includes()
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;he includes() method determines whether an array contains a specified element.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;Syntax&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;includes(searchElement)&lt;br&gt;
includes(searchElement, fromIndex)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Delhi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;London&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;includes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Output true&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;includes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Output false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#12-join"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  12. join()
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The join() method takes single argument and convert all the array elements into a string and return the converted string.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Delhi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;London&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; - &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Output "Delhi - Mumbai - Los Angeles - London"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#13-shift"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  13. shift()
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shift() method removes the first item of an array.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Delhi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;London&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Output ["Mumbai", "Los Angeles", "London"]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#14-unshift"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  14. unshift()
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unshift() method adds new items to the beginning of an array, and returns the new length.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Delhi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;London&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;unshift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;New York&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Output ["New York", "Tokyo", "Delhi", "Mumbai", "Los Angeles", "London"]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#15-fill"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  15. fill()
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fill() method fills the specified elements in an array with a static value. You can specify the position of where to start and end the filling. If not specified, all elements will be filled.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Delhi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;London&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Delhi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Output ["Delhi", "Delhi", "Delhi", "Delhi"]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#16-find"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  16. find()
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The find() method returns the value of the first element in an array that pass a test (provided as a function).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Delhi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;London&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;city&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;city&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Output "Mumbai"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#17-findindex"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  17. findIndex()
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findIndex() method returns the index of the first element in an array that pass a test (provided as a function).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Delhi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;London&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;city&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;findIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;city&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Output 1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#18-foreach"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  18. forEach()
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forEach() method calls a function once for each element in an array, in order.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Delhi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;London&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;city&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;idx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;idx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; is a beautiful city&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;city&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Output ["Delhi is a beautiful city", "Mumbai is a beautiful city", "Los Angeles is a beautiful city", "London is a beautiful city"]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#19-map"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  19. map()
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Delhi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;London&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;city&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; is a beautiful city&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;city&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Output ["Delhi is a beautiful city", "Mumbai is a beautiful city", "Los Angeles is a beautiful city", "London is a beautiful city"]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#20-filter"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  20. filter()
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The filter() method creates an array filled with all array elements that pass a test (provided as a function).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Delhi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;London&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;city&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;city&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Output ["Los Angeles"]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>#11) Explain call(), apply() &amp; bind() ❓</title>
      <author>Mayank Yadav</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 31 Jul 2021 15:13:42 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/myk/11-explain-call-apply-bind-49f9</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/myk/11-explain-call-apply-bind-49f9</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-call-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;🔰call()&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;✔The &lt;em&gt;call()&lt;/em&gt; method calls a function with a given &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; value and arguments provided individually.&lt;br&gt;
✔&lt;em&gt;call()&lt;/em&gt; method allows object to use method/function of another object.&lt;br&gt;
✔&lt;em&gt;call()&lt;/em&gt; accepts arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iAdE6ycO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ba4dwkan94mfjx0xm2s1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iAdE6ycO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ba4dwkan94mfjx0xm2s1.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-apply-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;🔰apply()&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;✔It is similar to &lt;em&gt;call()&lt;/em&gt; method but &lt;em&gt;call()&lt;/em&gt; method takes argument separately whereas in &lt;em&gt;apply()&lt;/em&gt; method arguments are passed as an array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NSB3HMM0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d1npgqya5lu3o7v11o8x.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NSB3HMM0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d1npgqya5lu3o7v11o8x.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-bind-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;🔰bind()&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;✔It creates a new function and when invoked has the &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; keyword set to the provided value.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1BFyhx9H--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c55z3rm42ielbc7tlyrb.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1BFyhx9H--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c55z3rm42ielbc7tlyrb.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
✔In case of &lt;em&gt;call()&lt;/em&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;em&gt;apply() the function is immediately called but in case of _bind()&lt;/em&gt; it does not call in-fact it just return another function which you can call it later.&lt;br&gt;
That's why in above example I've stored the value in a variable &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt; and then invoked it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Simple Countdown Timer using JavaScript</title>
      <author>Foolish Developer</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 31 Jul 2021 15:01:18 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/code_mystery/simple-countdown-timer-using-javascript-1jab</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/code_mystery/simple-countdown-timer-using-javascript-1jab</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;JavaScript countdown timers are used on a variety of e-commerce and under-construction websites to keep users up to date. We see on different types of e-commerce websites that a kind of countdown starts some time before the arrival of any product or offer.&lt;br&gt;
In this article I have created a countdown timer using simple JavaScript code and shared it with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://www.foolishdeveloper.com/2021/07/simple-countdown-timer-using-javascript.html"&gt;watch its live demo&lt;/a&gt; to know how it works. Creating such a project is much easier if you know how to create a digital clock. Here you can schedule a specific day or time in advance. Then, with the help of JavaScript code, subtracting the current time from that time, the subtraction is reduced every second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the picture above I have used the web page background # 90cbf3 here. The page contains four small boxes for days, hours, minutes and seconds, respectively. First of all you have to create an HTML and CSS file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-1-basic-structure-of-countdown-timer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 1: Basic structure of Countdown Timer
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only one line of HTML programming code has been used. Then I designed the webpage using the css code below. With background # 90cbf3 you can use any other color you want.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"timer"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;text-align&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;60px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#90cbf3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;sans-serif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;lighter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--h_bIyWl_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c0ppgorc2qbfye5okgdo.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--h_bIyWl_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c0ppgorc2qbfye5okgdo.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-2-activate-it-using-javascript-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 2: Activate it using JavaScript code
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I have implemented this countdown timer with the help of JavaScript. First of all, we have set a specific date with the help of &lt;code&gt;Date.parse&lt;/code&gt;. that is, you have to determine for what time you want to run the countdown.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;future&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;jun 12, 2022 01:30:00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then using the &lt;code&gt;new Date ()&lt;/code&gt; method I have taken the current time from the device. In this case, let me tell you, the time to use here is not the time of any server. It is only the local time of your device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I subtract the current time from the pre-determined time and store it in the diff (constant). As a result, I have got a total of how much time to countdown.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nx"&gt;diff&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;future&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now I have converted the total time of countdown to days, hours, minutes and seconds using JavaScript's &lt;code&gt;Math.floor&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;➤ We know that one second is equal to 1000 milliseconds, so we have divided the whole countdown time (diff) &lt;code&gt;by 1000&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
 ➤ Right now one minute is equal to 60 seconds so in this case we have divided &lt;code&gt;by 1000 * 60&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
 ➤ Since one hour is equal to 60 minutes, in this case we have divided &lt;code&gt;by 1000 * 60 * 60&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
 ➤ One day is equal to 24 hours so in this case it is divided &lt;code&gt;by 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;days&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;floor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;diff&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hours&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;floor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;diff&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mins&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;floor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;diff&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nx"&gt;secs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;floor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;diff&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;days&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nx"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hours&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;days&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nx"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mins&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hours&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nx"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;secs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mins&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Above we have done all the work of calculation, now we will arrange it neatly in the web page. For this I have used innerhtml  and in it I have beautifully arranged how it can be seen in the webpage. Here I have added text like day, hours, minutes, seconds etc. using span respectively.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;timer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerHTML&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;Days&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;Hours&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;Minutes&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;Seconds&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I have instructed to update this calculation &lt;code&gt;every 1000 milliseconds&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;code&gt;setInterval&lt;/code&gt;. Since the countdown time is intermittent every second, this system needs to be updated every second.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;updateTimer()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

 &lt;span class="nx"&gt;secs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;floor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;diff&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

 &lt;span class="nx"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;days&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nx"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hours&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;days&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nx"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mins&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hours&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nx"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;secs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mins&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

 &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;timer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerHTML&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;Days&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;Hours&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;Minutes&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;Seconds&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;updateTimer()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-3-give-the-times-the-size-of-a-box"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 3: Give the times the size of a box
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I have designed it using some basic css code and arranged it beautifully in web pages. As you can see in the picture above there is a small box to hold each time. I created that box using the code below. In this case I have used the background-color of the box &lt;code&gt;# 020b43&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;#timer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;3em&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;white&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;20px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;700px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;white&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nf"&gt;#timer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;inline-block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;min-width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;90px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;15px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#020b43&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;solid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#030d52&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;15px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bQfvKgPW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2rohjxnnlxa1lln734a3.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bQfvKgPW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2rohjxnnlxa1lln734a3.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-4-design-the-text"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 4: Design the text
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at the end of it all I will design the text that I added using the span in the JavaScript code. I have used the following css to determine the size, color, etc. of those texts.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;#timer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#ffffff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin-top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;15px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;.35em&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--P-aMlwNm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xgi892ux8h41qhk4ed0s.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--P-aMlwNm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xgi892ux8h41qhk4ed0s.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/hrushikesh41/how-to-embed-javascript-in-your-html-4f0j</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;How many of you like dynamic web pages ? Using HTML and CSS you can create and style static web page but you cannot perform actions on it. To make your web page dynamic &lt;b&gt; JavaScript language &lt;/b&gt; is used. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript was created by &lt;b&gt;Brendan Eich&lt;/b&gt;. It is a high-level, East to learn language use to create dynamic web pages. JavaScript is used to perform actions on elements like creating alert box on click of button. Performing some actions according to some condition by using if-else etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many such applications of JavaScript.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In JavaScript we select the element on which action is to performed by providing the id or class to it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's see how to embed your JavaScript in your HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like CSS we have multiple ways to embed our JavaScript in your HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Method - 1 &lt;b&gt;Using script tag&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like we used style tag in the same file to add styling to our pages here we use script tag. Inside script tag we write our script and add JS in our HTML. You can see the code below. Don't worry about the script that I write inside the script tag. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--U-qtN8Jg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1r30udt3f529g2099abx.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--U-qtN8Jg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1r30udt3f529g2099abx.PNG" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Output :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--f4k2YgCu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/knbm40d7xlooj06ixpik.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--f4k2YgCu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/knbm40d7xlooj06ixpik.PNG" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see that without writing a single word inside the p tag how I printed "Welcome to JavaScript" . That's the uniqueness of JavaScript. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's see the second method&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Method - 2 &lt;b&gt;Creating Separate JavaScript file&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again like CSS we create a separate JavaScript file with extension &lt;b&gt;.js&lt;/b&gt; . Now the question is how to link it in our HTML. So here again script tag is used. the &lt;b&gt;src&lt;/b&gt; attribute is used to provide location of your JavaScript file. You can see the code below .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7Ac3TkWX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wrhfoog8olzswzit3ps2.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7Ac3TkWX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wrhfoog8olzswzit3ps2.PNG" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Output :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's the Second Method of adding your JavaScript inside your HTML. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that's it for today. Don't worry about the script that I wrote inside the script tag or js file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In next post we will explore some more topic in JS .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meet you next post 😊😊&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Coding 👩‍💻👩‍💻👩‍💻&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the first post of this series, I'll talk about Design Patterns that make sense in Python. We'll see how to implement them and how they are used in the standard library and other third-party packages. In this post, we'll go over the Simple Factory Pattern and understand why it makes sense in Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VV-ahuEh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://64.media.tumblr.com/0420b027ed46bc71b06117eb7833fa3a/tumblr_mj9c1vjdL21qgfanco1_500.gifv" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VV-ahuEh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://64.media.tumblr.com/0420b027ed46bc71b06117eb7833fa3a/tumblr_mj9c1vjdL21qgfanco1_500.gifv" alt="Design Patterns That Make Sense in Python: Simple Factory via GIPHY"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design Patterns has been a popular subject since the Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software (a.k.a GoF) book was released back in 1994. GoF’s goals were to show techniques, a.k.a patterns, to improve an object-oriented design. In total, the book demonstrated 23 patterns, classified in 3 groups:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creational&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behavioral&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structural&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the creational patterns, we have the Factory Method. According to the book, the goal of this pattern is to define an interface to create an object. The sub classes will then decide which class will be instantiated. There’s also another variation called Simple Factory. This pattern creates an instance of an object without exposing the details behind the construction. In this article, we’ll see how to do that in Python in an idiomatic way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this is useful? Can we just call the constructor directly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pattern is helpful when you need to perform an extra setup before calling a constructor. In the next section we’ll see several examples on how they are used in the Python standard library and also in third-party packages such as &lt;a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/"&gt;pandas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#usage"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Usage
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this part, we’ll see how this pattern is used in practice and how you can implement it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#python-standard-library"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Python Standard Library
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;datetime&lt;/code&gt; module is one of the most important ones in the standard library. It defines a few classes such as &lt;code&gt;date&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;datetime&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;timedelta&lt;/code&gt;. This module uses the simple factory pattern extensively. A real example is the &lt;code&gt;date&lt;/code&gt; class. It has a method called &lt;code&gt;fromtimestamp&lt;/code&gt; that creates &lt;code&gt;date&lt;/code&gt; instances given a timestamp.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fromtimestamp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If we look at the implementation, we can see that it extracts the year, month and day from the &lt;code&gt;time&lt;/code&gt; instance and the call the constructor (&lt;code&gt;cls&lt;/code&gt;). This is the kind of setup that is abstracted away from the user.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;classmethod&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;fromtimestamp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Construct a date from a POSIX timestamp (like time.time())."&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;hh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;weekday&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;jday&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dst&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;localtime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another great example is the &lt;code&gt;fromisocalendar&lt;/code&gt; method, which performs an extensive setup. Instead of leaving it to the user, the class provides the functionality “for free” by hiding that from you.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/c304c9a7efa8751b5bc7526fa95cd5f30aac2b92/Lib/datetime.py#L860-L893
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;classmethod&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;fromisocalendar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;week&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;"""Construct a date from the ISO year, week number and weekday.
        This is the inverse of the date.isocalendar() function"""&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Year is bounded this way because 9999-12-31 is (9999, 52, 5)
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;MINYEAR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;year&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;MAXYEAR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;ValueError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Year is out of range: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;week&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;53&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;out_of_range&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;week&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;53&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# ISO years have 53 weeks in them on years starting with a
&lt;/span&gt;                &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Thursday and leap years starting on a Wednesday
&lt;/span&gt;                &lt;span class="n"&gt;first_weekday&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_ymd2ord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;first_weekday&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;first_weekday&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;
                                           &lt;span class="n"&gt;_is_leap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))):&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="n"&gt;out_of_range&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;out_of_range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;ValueError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Invalid week: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;week&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;day&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;ValueError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Invalid weekday: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; (range is [1, 7])"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Now compute the offset from (Y, 1, 1) in days:
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="n"&gt;day_offset&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;week&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;day&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Calculate the ordinal day for monday, week 1
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="n"&gt;day_1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_isoweek1monday&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;ord_day&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;day_1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;day_offset&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_ord2ymd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ord_day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;....&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pandas"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Pandas
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pandas&lt;/code&gt; is one of the most used Python packages thanks to the rise of Data Science and Machine Learning. Just like Python, &lt;code&gt;pandas&lt;/code&gt; also makes use of factory methods. A classic example is the &lt;code&gt;from_dict&lt;/code&gt; method that belongs to the &lt;code&gt;DataFrame&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'row_1'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'row_2'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'a'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'b'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'c'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'d'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;DataFrame&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;orient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'index'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
               &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;row_1&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;row_2&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When we inspect the implementation we can also see a lot of setup and extra checks.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;columns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;columns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dtype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dtype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-implement-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to Implement It
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most idiomatic way of implementing factory methods in Python is by decorating them as &lt;code&gt;classmethod&lt;/code&gt;. In Python, regular methods are attached to an object instance. We can access the objects’ fields via the &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt; argument. &lt;code&gt;classmethod&lt;/code&gt;, on the other hand, are bound not to an instance but to a &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt;. That means when we call &lt;code&gt;MyClass.factory_method&lt;/code&gt; we are passing &lt;code&gt;MyClass&lt;/code&gt; as the first argument, called &lt;code&gt;cls&lt;/code&gt;. This property makes them an excellent alternative for factory methods since calling &lt;code&gt;cls(args)&lt;/code&gt; inside a &lt;code&gt;classmethod&lt;/code&gt; is the same as &lt;code&gt;MyClass(args)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To design your own factory methods, it’s sufficient to decorate it as a &lt;code&gt;classmethod&lt;/code&gt; and return a new instance built with the &lt;code&gt;cls&lt;/code&gt; argument. For example, presume that we want to implement a &lt;code&gt;Point&lt;/code&gt; class and we want it also be constructed from Polar coordinates. The extra setup to convert from Polar to Cartesian is kept inside the method. Not simply it’s more readable, but also simplifies the constructor.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;classmethod&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;from_polar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;theta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Point"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;"""
        Converts a polar coordinate into cartesian point.

        &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Point.from_polar(r=-2**0.5, theta=math.pi / 4)
        Point(x=-1.00, y=-1.00)
        """&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;theta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;theta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__repr__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from_polar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;theta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's pretty much it! I hope you’ve learned something different and useful. Simple Factory methods are very cool and can abstract a lot of boilerplate. Not to mention that it makes your code clean and readable. In this post I showed how this pattern is used in the standard library and in other packages such as &lt;code&gt;pandas&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="#which-option-would-you-take"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Which option would you take?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend medium amount of time in rare exotic edge cases but also in the majority of the cases (&lt;code&gt;vanilla JS&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend a lot less time in the majority of cases but a lot more development time in rare and exotic cases (&lt;code&gt;TypeScript&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will give you my answer at the end of this article, but now let's see a needlessly complicated JS example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;thing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;sushi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;🍣&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;doThangStuff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;thang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stuff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;thisWillBeBound&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Sushi:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sushi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;thang&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;stuff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;123&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;thing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;callThing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;thing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;thisWillBeBound&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;thing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;thisWillBeBound&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;bind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;assign&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;sushi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;sushi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}));&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;thing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;thisWillBeBound&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;doMagic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;aPropertyAddedLater&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;55&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;thang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;aPropertyAddedLater&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;123&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;thang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;doMagic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;thing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;thisWillBeBound&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Sushi: 🍣&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;thang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;callThing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Sushi: sushi&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;thing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;thisWillBeBound&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Sushi: sushi&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;renameFunction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;defineProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;renameFunction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;thang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;doMagic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;doUnicornStuff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;thang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;doMagic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// doUnicornStuff&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I know it's a lot, you don't need to fully understand it, but the point is: everything here is valid JS code. The flexibility of the language is allowing all this and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is really-really &lt;em&gt;useful&lt;/em&gt; when you are writing a throwaway script (originally intended design of the language) and you do not want to write pages of code. This is however &lt;em&gt;counterproductive&lt;/em&gt; when you have hundreds of files in a large project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#who-would-write-this-convoluted-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Who would write this convoluted code?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, &lt;code&gt;renameFunction&lt;/code&gt; was already coming from a project I took over, so some of it is in the wild already, but in most cases nobody would write it. That's one thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other one is that tooling (your IDE, the engine running code, the code linters, code coverage tools etc.) must work with the language as it is with all its options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yes, nobody writes code like this, but no, the tooling cannot &lt;em&gt;trust&lt;/em&gt; the language not to be like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#toxic-flexibility"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Toxic flexibility
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me define it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toxic flexibility&lt;/strong&gt; of a language is when allowing a large number of exotic edge cases hurt the coding experience of most of the line, rendering it impossible to have useful tooling built around the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one hand you have &lt;code&gt;trust&lt;/code&gt; in code: at a given line in your code you are sure what are the possible values. And at the other: a range of unlikely scenarios resulting from a super high degree of flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-reason-behind-the-creation-of-typescript"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The reason behind the creation of TypeScript
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, it was not enforcing the dated &lt;code&gt;Object oriented principle&lt;/code&gt; on this beautifully flexible and functional language (irony). It was created for increasing &lt;code&gt;trust&lt;/code&gt; in the code the &lt;strong&gt;tooling&lt;/strong&gt; was working with. Let me quote &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/typescript-creator-how-the-programming-language-beat-microsofts-open-source-fears/"&gt;Anders Hjelsberg, co-creator of TypeScript&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the &lt;em&gt;programmer productivity features&lt;/em&gt; we have like VSCode's &lt;strong&gt;IntelliSense&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;code definition&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;code navigation&lt;/strong&gt; require the &lt;strong&gt;IDE&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;to be able to reason about the code&lt;/em&gt; that you're working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;type system&lt;/strong&gt; is one way you can &lt;em&gt;reason about your code&lt;/em&gt;. It's the ability to check your code before you run and deploy it. Without types in a language that's almost impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So by adding type information and understanding how that information changes from line-to-line gave us better tooling, living documentation and quicker development times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have ever tried a strongly-typed language with a good IDE (like &lt;strong&gt;Visual Studio&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;C#&lt;/strong&gt;) you know how it can give you for every line the suggestions just you need, you only need one letter from it basically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#working-for-the-majority-of-cases"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Working for the majority of cases
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I wrote above: the tooling of &lt;code&gt;JS&lt;/code&gt; cannot really help you, since you have to &lt;strong&gt;run&lt;/strong&gt; the code to actually know what it is really doing. In that case the very rare edge cases of the flexibility of the language forbid any smarter static analysis of the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By adding code with proper types you are reducing the &lt;strong&gt;number of cases&lt;/strong&gt; you can have in a given line of code. Inferring the rest from primitive types (we are mostly dealing with &lt;code&gt;phoneNumber&lt;/code&gt;s and &lt;code&gt;email&lt;/code&gt;s and &lt;code&gt;score&lt;/code&gt;s, &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;s and &lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt;s...)  and solid coding &lt;code&gt;TypeScript&lt;/code&gt; compiler does the heavy lifting for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give you my answer to the question at the start: I prefer &lt;strong&gt;code completion&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;static refactoring help&lt;/strong&gt; in every line I write over the flexibility of vanilla &lt;code&gt;JS&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "silence" of coding tools makes me check the functions I call, searching for signs of what they'd return, write me tests I would not need and makes me nervous with simple everyday tasks, like renaming a function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are everyday scenarios and it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;time lost&lt;/strong&gt;. With &lt;code&gt;TypeScript&lt;/code&gt; these are usually covered by the tooling so I need to think more about what my code actually should do over making sure it is really getting and emitting the correct data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;TypeScript&lt;/code&gt; has also drawbacks of course. Writing exotic, very dynamic code and typing it properly will take a lot more time than in vanilla &lt;code&gt;JS&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I would rather pay this price than not having the tooling that works for me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SQL - NOT REALLY LANGUAGE.</title>
      <author>Ha Tuan Em</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 31 Jul 2021 13:42:04 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/hte305/sql-not-really-language-3jen</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/hte305/sql-not-really-language-3jen</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-sql-language"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The SQL language 👨‍🚀
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SQL is a tool for organizing, managing and retrieving data stored by a computer database. The original named by IBM was &lt;strong&gt;Structured English Query Language&lt;/strong&gt; which we often call is &lt;strong&gt;SEQUEL&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;SQL&lt;/strong&gt; - the shorten named by the Hawker Siddeley Aircraft Company of the United Kingdom after was a trademark owner. But somehow both them are correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SQL is a computer language that you can work with the database. In real life, you are often working with a special type of database and in SQL we are called it is the &lt;strong&gt;relational database&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The computer program that controls the database is called a database management system (DBMS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we use SQL to make request. The DBMS processes that request and retrieves the requested data and returns it to us. Whole this process we is called &lt;strong&gt;query&lt;/strong&gt; - hence the name &lt;strong&gt;Structured&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Query&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Language&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;----------------&lt;/span&gt;
  SQL Request 👨‍🚀 
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Give me 🍎&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;----------------&lt;/span&gt;
      | ^
      | | 🍎 Data
      v |
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;---------------------&lt;/span&gt;
    DBMS 🏢
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;---------------------&lt;/span&gt;
      | ^
      | | 🍎 Data
      v |
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;---------------------&lt;/span&gt;
   Database
&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Mysql, MSSQL,..&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
     Store
🍓🍒🍎🍉🍑🍊🥭🍍🍌🍋🍈
🍏🍐🥝🍇🥥🍅🌶🍄🥕🍠🧅
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;---------------------&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#database-management-system-dbms"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Database Management System (DBMS) 🏢
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SQL is used to control all the functions in DBMS. It's include many tools to process data in the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data definition: allows a user define the structure and organization of the stored data and relations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data retrieval: allows a user or and application program retrieve stored data and use it from the database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data manipulation: allows a user or an application program to retrieve stored data from the database and use it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access control: used to restrict a user permission to protected data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data sharing: used to coordinate data sharing by the current users to make sure that changes at the same time will not impact another one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data integrity: used to defines integrity constraints in the database. Protected it from inconsistent updates or system failures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#summary"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Summary:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SQL is comprehensive language for controlling and interacting with the database management system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SQL is not really a computer language like C++, C, Java,...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SQL is a database sublanguage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SQL statements can be embedded into another language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;SQL is used to control all the functions in DBMS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enjoy your time 🪴&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How I Get a Job as a Software Engineer in Sweden.</title>
      <author>Ankur Tyagi</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 31 Jul 2021 13:18:36 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/tyaga001/how-i-get-a-job-as-a-software-engineer-in-sweden-p31</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/tyaga001/how-i-get-a-job-as-a-software-engineer-in-sweden-p31</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-lot-of-people-asked-me-about-how-i-get-a-job-in-sweden-as-a-software-engineer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A lot of people asked me about how I get a job in Sweden as a software engineer.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here’s my article explaining everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lets-face-it-being-a-software-engineer-is-not-easy-especially-during-your-struggling-days"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Let's face it, being a software engineer is not easy, especially during your struggling days.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bigger challenge comes when you need to pay your bills and at the same time want to develop your skills as well to grow as a software developer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest problems that self-taught developers face at the beginning of their careers is guidance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They don't know exactly how to ask questions &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whom to ask.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So they usually get lost too easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making a career transition is not an easy step. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the tough decisions of my life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started my career in India and working abroad as a software engineer is one of the dreams I had since I started my career back in 2010. (Typical middle-class mindset). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my Accenture days, I worked mostly with US clients so a couple of times my company tried for H1B but every time I didn't get through that shit lottery system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then I moved to Pune in 2014 and work very hard to enter a product-based company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Typical product-based companies, you will have very few chances to get onsite opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I was always in touch with my old colleagues, you know we called this "Networking"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The currency of real networking is not greed but generosity." -- Keith &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was doing pretty well and then in March 2020 covid came and I started a Facebook group where my old colleagues/tech friends came together on my request as a mentor &amp;amp; helped almost 200+ people in 2020 with different technology stacks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are a group of people with all tech stacks from testing to development to the cloud. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There I met my friend  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/codewithakshat"&gt;Akshat&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; We both collaborate &amp;amp; work as good partners/colleagues/mentors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As time progress to November 2020, we did well to help lots of people as part of our mentorship program. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One typical day, I just casually asked Akshat to refer me to your company (You know back of mind, that abroad dream), As Akshat was already in Sweden for the last couple of years &amp;amp; doing excellent work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTW He is a Java champion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as a good friend, he referred me but as you know typical hiring process takes a lot of time &amp;amp; you should have good patience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the process took almost 3-4 months to complete:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A general cultural fit round (Most important round)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A coding assignment which I need to complete in a week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A typical technical round &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A typical (but something different from India) managerial round.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A typical HR round to salary, Visa, and relocation stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But life takes a U-turn again in May 2021 start, I was supposed to travel in May first week but we were all infected with Covid and we lost our mother-in-law. And we were not in a condition to make this big shift in life again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I check with the company &amp;amp; they helped me a lot &amp;amp; supported me very well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In May 2021 typically I was jobless as 30th April was my last working day in my last company. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#so-be-ready-for-ups-amp-down-in-life-when-you-want-something-to-achieve"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  So be ready for ups &amp;amp; down in life when you want something to achieve.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But again remember Your network is your net worth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you know your game, you will get opportunities for sure, some may get early, some may get later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my personal view, Tech has shown the most successful people are often also those who rely heavily on the power of networking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The successful networkers I know, the ones receiving tons of referrals and feeling truly happy about themselves, continually put the other person's needs ahead of their own." -- Bob Burg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in June, a new phase of life started for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally Moved to Sweden... 👇&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New phase of life started today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moved to Sweden... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I Joined Volvo Cars as a Senior Software Engineer 🙌&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is what I was taking about since long that You’ll get amazing opportunity here on Twitter...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If I can do it You can as well... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cheers 🍻 &lt;a href="https://t.co/DBRzt3Ls4o"&gt;pic.twitter.com/DBRzt3Ls4o&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ankur💻🎧💪 (@TheAnkurTyagi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheAnkurTyagi/status/1403339612714635264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  If you are brave enough to say goodbye, life will reward you with a new Hello.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"My Golden Rule of Networking is simple: Don't keep score."&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you brave enough to say goodbye, life will reward you with a new Hello.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beginning makes the conditions perfect 🙌&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You will never win if you never begin. &lt;a href="https://t.co/OVoDEAMASw"&gt;pic.twitter.com/OVoDEAMASw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ankur💻🎧💪 (@TheAnkurTyagi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheAnkurTyagi/status/1405139711002177543?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;  
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#this-is-just-a-start-instead-of-better-glasses-your-network-gives-you-better-eyes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  This is just a start "Instead of better glasses, your network gives you better eyes."
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Networking is not about just connecting people. &lt;br&gt;
Pulling a good network together takes effort, sincerity, and time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's about connecting people with people, people with ideas, and people with opportunities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with networking, I would suggest, You can try below typical ways to enter a foreign market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-good-paths-which-you-can-try-if-you-really-want-to-work-abroad"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3 good paths which you can try if you really want to work abroad.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk to your current company to see if there are any opportunities that you can be considered for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply for a skilled migrant visa/residency, go abroad and look for a job. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada, UK, and Australia have point-based visas. You can check your eligibility and try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go as a student, as it’s easier to get a student visa and then get the bridging visa while you are there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Valid Mountain Array — Solution and Approch in Java</title>
      <author>Rubleen Kaur</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 31 Jul 2021 12:59:48 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/rubleen1903/valid-mountain-array-solution-and-approch-in-java-p6g</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/rubleen1903/valid-mountain-array-solution-and-approch-in-java-p6g</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have started practising for my interviews on Leetcode and thought of sharing each problem and the approach i use for solving them through these blogs.&lt;br&gt;
The first problem I chose is Valid Mountain Array and is an easy problem as compared to the one’s i’ve come across on leetcode.Each and every problem has an algorithmic approach one needs to understand before moving ahead with coding the solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem we are going to discuss : &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#valid-mountain-array"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-mountain-array/"&gt;Valid Mountain Array&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dRXLE1qi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/msa2cd5o39euiea4n92z.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dRXLE1qi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/msa2cd5o39euiea4n92z.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given an array of integers arr, return true if and only if it is a valid mountain array.&lt;br&gt;
Recall that arr is a mountain array if and only if:&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;arr.length &amp;gt;= 3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*There exists some i with 0 &amp;lt; i &amp;lt; arr.length - 1 such that:&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;arr[0] &amp;lt; arr[1]&lt;/code&gt; &amp;lt; ... &amp;lt; &lt;code&gt;arr[i - 1] &amp;lt; arr[i]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;arr[i] &amp;gt; arr[i + 1]&lt;/code&gt; &amp;gt; ... &amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;arr[arr.length - 1]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#approach-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Approach :
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--X52zsvfF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/eqc26lqap9c67thua5l7.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--X52zsvfF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/eqc26lqap9c67thua5l7.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I solved it using two variables which were used to check the given conditions.&lt;br&gt;
Do go through the above images to get a detailed approach and alogirthm how the problem was solved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#solution-in-java-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Solution in Java !
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;// 941. Valid Mountain Array
// Easy
// Given an array of integers arr, return true if and only if it is a valid mountain array.

// Recall that arr is a mountain array if and only if:

// arr.length &amp;gt;= 3
// There exists some i with 0 &amp;lt; i &amp;lt; arr.length - 1 such that:
// arr[0] &amp;lt; arr[1] &amp;lt; ... &amp;lt; arr[i - 1] &amp;lt; arr[i]
// arr[i] &amp;gt; arr[i + 1] &amp;gt; ... &amp;gt; arr[arr.length - 1]

//Solution in java

class Solution {
    public boolean validMountainArray(int[] arr) {
        int i = 0;
        int j = arr.length - 1;
        int n = arr.length - 1;
        while (i + 1 &amp;lt; n &amp;amp;&amp;amp; arr[i] &amp;lt; arr[i+1]) {
            i++;
        }

        while (j &amp;gt; 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; arr[j] &amp;lt; arr[j-1]) {
            j--;
        }

        return (i &amp;gt; 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; i == j &amp;amp;&amp;amp; j &amp;lt; n);
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Multiply a string? 🤔</title>
      <author>Adam Crockett</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 31 Jul 2021 12:39:18 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/adam_cyclones/multiply-a-string-3eja</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/adam_cyclones/multiply-a-string-3eja</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here's a simple thought, why can't you multiply, devide subtract a string?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In language design terms here's some examples.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Hello world&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ["Hello world", "Hello world"];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Hello world&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// "Hello wo"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Hello world&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Hel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;lo &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;wor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;ld&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Umm yeah it's not so easy I suppose to handle remainders and it's a little confusing in some of the cases, what do you think?&lt;/p&gt;
