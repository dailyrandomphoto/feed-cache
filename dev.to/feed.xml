      <description>&lt;p&gt;👉 DOM stands for Document Object Model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉 DOM is 'World Wide Web Consortium' (W3C) standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉 DOM is a programming interface for HTML documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉 When browser try to render a HTML document, it creates an &lt;br&gt;
   object based on the HTML document called DOM. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉 By using DOM, we can manipulate or change various elements &lt;br&gt;
   inside the HTML document.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Learn With Me:Apple's Swift Literals</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/thisisanshgupta/learn-with-meapples-swift-literals-2ijd</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello guys and Welcome to &lt;em&gt;Learn With Me: Apple's Swift&lt;/em&gt;.In previous tutorial you learned about Variables and Constants and today we are going to learn about Literals .So without wasting time let's start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#literals"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Literals
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Literals are representations of fixed values in a program. They can be numbers, characters, or strings, etc. For example, "Hello, World!", 12, 23.0, "C", etc.&lt;br&gt;
Swift supports 4 types of &lt;br&gt;
literals,that are: &lt;br&gt;
•&lt;strong&gt;Integer Literals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
•&lt;strong&gt;Floating-point Literals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
•&lt;strong&gt;Boolean Literals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
•&lt;strong&gt;String and Character Literals&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
So let's study about them in brief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#integer-literals"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Integer Literals
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integer literals are those that do not have a fractional or an exponential part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four types of integer literals in Swift:&lt;br&gt;
•A decimal number, with no prefix.&lt;br&gt;
•A binary number, with a 0b prefix.&lt;br&gt;
•An octal number, with a 0o prefix.&lt;br&gt;
•A hexadecimal number, with a 0x prefix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#floatingpoint-literals"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Floating-Point Literals
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Floating-point literals are numeric literals that have floating decimal points or they are in fraction. For example,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight swift"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;7.008&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here,&lt;strong&gt;7.008&lt;/strong&gt; is a floating-point literal assigned to the &lt;strong&gt;radius&lt;/strong&gt; constant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#boolean-literals"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Boolean Literals
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are only two Boolean Literals:&lt;strong&gt;true&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;false&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
For example,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight swift"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#character-literals"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Character Literals
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Character literals are Unicode characters enclosed in double quotes.For example,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight swift"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;char&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Character&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"S"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#string-literals"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  String Literals
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;String literals are sequences of characters enclosed in double quotes.For example,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight swift"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Jonathan"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.I hope you will enjoy learning it.If you have any issues then let me know in the discussions.And in next part we are going to learn about Data Types in Swift.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tales of the Autistic Developer - Loud Loud World</title>
      <author>Brandon Weaver</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 17 Oct 2021 06:14:37 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/baweaver/tales-of-the-autistic-developer-loud-loud-world-122c</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/baweaver/tales-of-the-autistic-developer-loud-loud-world-122c</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For those who don't know me, I'm autistic. I've been a developer for the better part of a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn't find out I was ASD until 19, and didn't reconcile with that until years later. These posts will be a combination of advice I've given to those who are like me, as well as a letter of sorts to my past self who could have used a lot of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I write these posts in the hopes that someone like me will find value in knowing a very simple and very important truth about ASD:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You are not alone, and you are loved.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#loud-loud-world"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Loud Loud World
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For autistic people the world is so very loud, and I fear that this has led to a very common misunderstanding of our experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not that we lack the capacity for things like listening, eating, empathy, or so many other skills as much as we're in a near-constant state of being overwhelmed by everything around us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is less about solutions, and more about my experience as a disability. So many would like to frame what I have as a "superpower" but deny the handicaps I face, so I'd like to take this time to write on the struggles I face on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#i-can-hear-everything"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  I Can Hear Everything
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common complaint of myself as a child is I was never paying attention, would frequently ask folks to repeat things, and in general just not "hear".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically I was also mocked for having near supernatural hearing abilities. If my name was mentioned or any other trigger word for a hobby I would hear it, even clear across a room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The misconceptions of the first section are a direct result of the second. It's not that I couldn't hear, but that I heard too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My brain is constantly on, and I experience everything at once. I can't turn it off, I don't know how and there aren't any great solutions I've found beyond noise cancelling headphones and moving out of noisy environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heck, I can hear electricity in the walls. Did you know it makes noise, because I certainly do. A short in an electronic device will scream at me, and with it my focus goes right out a window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm most certainly not ignoring you when you're talking, in fact I'm reminding myself to pay attention in my head on repeat, but if a loud noise or something troubling happens my attention is gone. You could talk about my favorite hobbies and I'd still twitch at anything around me happening, try as I might to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#smell-everything"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Smell Everything
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In elementary school I was quite viciously mocked for smelling things, including by a teacher who egged it on. A lot of trauma in me realizing who I was could be traced to teachers like this, but back to the point I could smell anything around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If lunch was being prepared I could tell you exactly what it was (if I'd experienced it before), what burned, what flavor the gum under the table probably was, and whether or not my classmates had just been to gym class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just in the past year I'd smelled rain and heard a dropping that led me to find a small leak in one of the doors of my home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn't unusual for this to make me slightly sick, as scent is very closely tied to taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any more I've taken to a habit of wearing a certain amount of cologne as a centering scent to try and distract me from doing this. Most of my coping follows a similar strategy of dulling my senses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#taste-overload"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Taste Overload
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some would call me a picky eater, they're probably right. If something is unfamiliar to me it's overwhelming, and certain textures and combinations for some reason will make me physically sick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The annoying part is that I don't always know what those textures or combinations might be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's been a perpetual fear of mine that I might offend someone by not being able to eat their cooking, so many times I'll try anyways and end up making myself sick for a few days afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in college there was an eating competition where they gave us tacos with lettuce. Those who know me would know that  that's one thing which will absolutely make me visibly sick within seconds, so I had to drop out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This certainly does not make it easy to find a balanced diet, and trust me I do try. It's also why I order the exact same thing every time I go to the same restaurant. I know it's safe, and safe matters a lot to me, which is how I cope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#visual-stimulus"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Visual Stimulus
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I'm not at the point of epilepsy, but flashing gifs and reactions will wreck my concentration. I'm very happy that Slack added an option to turn them off or I'd never get anything done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My vision isn't perfect, I wear glasses, but any visual stimulus around me sends my head into full alert mode. It's also why you'll catch me closing one eye outside, or closing both if I'm thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#touch-and-feel"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Touch and Feel
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are even fabrics and various textures that if I touch or have to keep on I get very uncomfortable with. Fabric tags, wools (especially socks), seams, and other things some folks can ignore will drive me up a wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there's so much as a small pebble that gets into my shoe it's going to annoy me the entire day until I get it out, including ones embedded in the bottom of my sole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#emotional-overload"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Emotional Overload
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People have called me a robot for years, slightly monotone voice, and a seeming absence of cognizance of emotions. Sure, there's some truth to that, I don't social well all the time and I had to learn those rules the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What isn't true, however, is that I don't feel. Quite the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to turn off news, social media, and stop talking to people because once I hear problems I become deeply invested in fixing them. My mind is hard-wired like that, I want to help, and I'm far too easy to bait into things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result I've had to become exceptionally cautious in how much I talk to others outside of close groups. The real annoyance is I can feel their pain, but I have no idea how to respond appropriately, so rather than try I frequently have to wait and internalize that pain which is not healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate that I cannot fix everything, so instead I try and focus on what I know I can have an impact on and direct my attentions there. Doesn't help that sick feeling though knowing how much more pain there is in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#temporal-hijinks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Temporal Hijinks
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no concept of time. People at work would disagree with me on that and comment that I show up early to things, know exactly when things are happening, and am generally on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's only because I have alarms for everything, calendar reminders, sticky notes, and entire systems meant to keep me on track. I adhere to strict schedules, and should I break those schedules I'll burn out hard and lose my sense of self for at least a few weeks while I recover and recalibrate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a similar reason to why I despise phone calls and synchronous events which require presence, as they'll ruin the entire rest of my day for getting anything done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The irony, as it tends to be, is that all of these systems got me promoted into roles where it's my job to be on top of such things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-migraines"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Migraines
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the world is too much, when anxiety gets to me, and when I just can't turn it off my body will eventually take drastic measures and start me into a series of migraines that will have me laid up in bed for at least a full day, often times two to three days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I get close to that point I will be very short tempered and intentional with my time, trying to jettison anything and everything that's not completely relevant to tasks at hand that are required to get done. I start going into lockdown mode to protect myself, and if I miss I'm going to be out of it for potentially multiple days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I keep ignoring it? Burnout is a very real threat for me, and one that I have to be exceptionally cautious of. Some would say enjoying what you do is a cure, but if anything that's the curse which has me constantly flirting with the line where I'm not coming back for a good couple of months beyond rote and repetition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#wrapping-up"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Wrapping Up
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there's one thing I want people to get out of this, it's that I'm a whole human. You don't get all the benefits of autism without the drawbacks, and the drawbacks make you no less valid of love and acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years I've had great success in the industry, but many would erase my disability, and in doing such they would discriminate against those with similar issues. To only write of the good, and never the bad, would be dishonest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I wrap up today by saying that I'm me, flaws and all. It's a loud loud world out there, and we do our best to participate in it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>React basics: explaining the useContext hook</title>
      <author>Chris Bongers</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 17 Oct 2021 06:00:39 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/dailydevtips1/react-basics-explaining-the-usecontext-hook-1dgd</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/dailydevtips1/react-basics-explaining-the-usecontext-hook-1dgd</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we have data that we need to access in almost all parts of our components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will become a hassle to pass them down to each component, exactly where context comes in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, I'll use a specific theme for a website.&lt;br&gt;
Our website has a blue and a red theme, which the user can toggle based on their preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-a-context"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating a context
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we can do anything, we need to create a new context to wrap around our application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let's look at how that works, create a new file called &lt;code&gt;ThemeContext.js&lt;/code&gt; and start by adding the imports we need.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now let's define our themes, this is still pretty hardcoded, but it will work fine for this demo.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;themes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;white&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;black&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you can see, we have a blue and a red theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing we need to do now is create an actual context with a default value.&lt;br&gt;
In my case, I want the red theme to be the blue theme to be the default.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ThemeContext&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;themes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And then, we can export a &lt;code&gt;ThemeProvider&lt;/code&gt; which helps us wrap this theme around our app.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ThemeProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ThemeContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Provider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;themes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/ThemeContext.Provider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This provider can now be wrapped around our app to apply the context. Let's head over to our &lt;code&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file and do that.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ThemeProvider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;./context/ThemeContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ThemeProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;The&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;rest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;our&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/ThemeProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This gives us access to anything in the theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#using-the-context"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Using the context
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty cool, but how do we now use this context?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a sample component that will act as our paint. This component will take the context and display the correct color.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useContext&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ThemeContext&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;../context/ThemeContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Paint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ThemeContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;2rem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      I'm the paint
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This component will render a simple div, with colors based on whatever our theme is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Head back to your &lt;code&gt;App&lt;/code&gt; and include this component.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Paint&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;./components/Paint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ThemeProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Paint&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/ThemeProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You should now see the block in your browser like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RjOeGmF5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633673041261/hqoFz5uOE.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RjOeGmF5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633673041261/hqoFz5uOE.png" alt="Basic context painted component in React"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we now change our &lt;code&gt;ThemeContext&lt;/code&gt; to be red, we should see a red box.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ThemeContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Provider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;themes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0qVIzkxj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633673125222/Rt1pNhzK2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0qVIzkxj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633673125222/Rt1pNhzK2.png" alt="Changed context provider in React"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#adding-a-toggle"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Adding a toggle
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is pretty exciting stuff already, but it becomes super powerful by adding a dynamic switch for our theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say we want to render two buttons. Each button will set a different theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this, we first have to use &lt;a href="https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/react-basics-explaining-the-usestate-hook/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;useState&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in our &lt;code&gt;ThemeContext&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ThemeProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;themeProviderData&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;themes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;setTheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ThemeContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Provider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;themeProviderData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/ThemeContext.Provider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you can see, I use the &lt;code&gt;useState&lt;/code&gt; function to now set a basic theme (blue). &lt;br&gt;
Then I create a primary object containing the current theme data and pass the &lt;code&gt;setState&lt;/code&gt; function to modify the state variable.&lt;br&gt;
Then we pass this object as the value of our theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing to note here is that we changed from passing a single variable to passing an object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So head over to your &lt;code&gt;Paint&lt;/code&gt; component and change the import like so:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ThemeContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then we can go ahead and create a new component called &lt;code&gt;Toggle&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useContext&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ThemeContext&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;../context/ThemeContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Toggle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTheme&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ThemeContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;RED&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;THEME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;BLUE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;THEME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you can see, this function extracts the &lt;code&gt;setTheme&lt;/code&gt; function from our context.&lt;br&gt;
It then renders two buttons and appends this function with a specific value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and include this component in your &lt;code&gt;App&lt;/code&gt; like so:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Toggle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;./components/Toggle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ThemeProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Paint&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Toggle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/ThemeProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And there we have it. We can now toggle between our two themes!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Winning my first Hacktoberfest!</title>
      <author>SHOURYA GUPTA</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/shouryabrahmastra/winning-my-first-hacktoberfest-3fba</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;🎆Hello!! Everyone reading this.✨&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my first post on &lt;a href="https://dev.to/"&gt;dev&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; I'm so excited to tell my journey of my first Hacktoberfest Event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#backstory"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Backstory
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all started when I came across this event on the very 1st day of this October month when I came across a WhatsApp forward that enthusiastic coder and developers can contribute to a month long festival of contributing to the open source. Truly speaking the winning swag by contributing to Open-Source attracted me more than the contribution that I made.&lt;br&gt;
But still with no pre-knowledge of how to contribute to this open source world I just blindly jumped into this task and with the help of the web and YouTube and my persisting knowledge of DSA I some how learnt to create my first pull request. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#it-was-a-leap-of-new-era-for-my-coding-career-as-well-i-learnt-more-than-i-could-contribute-to-this-open-source-world"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  It was a leap of new era for my coding career as well; I learnt more than I could contribute to this open source world.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#main-event"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Main Event
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first PR to count towards the event was :&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/qwert-ji/the-c/pull/10"&gt;qwert-ji&lt;/a&gt; which was on 1st Oct.&lt;br&gt;
Seeing that already 1 out of 4 PR was already done, I was on a rampage to find more repos tagged with the &lt;code&gt;hacktoberfest&lt;/code&gt; labels to contribute to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#contributions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Contributions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the list of the PR's that I submitted, counted towards the event :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/STICMedicaps/Hacktoberfest/pull/20"&gt;STICMedicaps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/qwert-ji/the-c/pull/10"&gt;qwert-ji&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/Astrodevil/Programming-Basics/pull/289"&gt;Astrodevil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/AkshayNachappa/Hacktoberfest_2021/pull/33"&gt;AkshayNachappa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/ieeeiasvit/ProLang-IAS/pull/34"&gt;ieeeiasvit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/rohithmaddz/Programs/pull/8"&gt;rohithmaddz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/guptaravi5400/hacktoberfest_2021/pull/15"&gt;guptaravi5400&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/throwaway-root/DataStructers/pull/62"&gt;throwaway-root&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/manish-virgat/Hacktoberfest-C-Program/pull/101"&gt;manish-virgat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/basava1134/First-PR-Hacktoberfest/pull/29"&gt;basava1134&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/hctnm2/Open-Source-Enthusiast/pull/128"&gt;hctnm2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/JayanthSriram27/Hacktoberfest2k21/pull/40"&gt;JayanthSriram27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you'll look at all the PR's I've made during this time, you'll notice that all of them are minor yet notable changes and these contributions meet the criteria for being counted towards the &lt;em&gt;hacktoberfest&lt;/em&gt; event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm starting to get the hang of it now by actually interacting with maintainers and other contributors. It's such a welcoming community who guide beginners with such patience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#results"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Results
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the minimum PRs required to win some swag, mine were only waiting for the review period of 14 days to complete today.&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Database Normalization</title>
      <author>Fajar Zuhri Hadiyanto</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 17 Oct 2021 05:30:07 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/fajarzuhrihadiyanto/database-normalization-jil</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/fajarzuhrihadiyanto/database-normalization-jil</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Database normalization is a process of restructuring database tables in order to minimize data redundancy and avoid data anomalies such as insert anomaly, delete anomaly, and update anomaly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--291bXbQi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/a7ubg8q8lj76y5yocm6l.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--291bXbQi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/a7ubg8q8lj76y5yocm6l.png" alt="Example"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insert anomaly&lt;/strong&gt; occurs when we have to insert unnecessary similar data. for example when we have the data above. in that case, if we want to add another student that has the same course, then we have to add the same course information such as the lecturer's name, even though that is unnecessarily needed, because, for each same course, the lecturer will be the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, there is a &lt;strong&gt;delete anomaly&lt;/strong&gt; that occurs when we want to delete data in a certain domain and it affects the loss of other data domains. let's take the previous table as an example. when all students in the fundamental programming course have passed the course, we might delete those students' information because we don't need those students in that table anymore. When we remove the data, it will impact the loss of course information, such as who teaches that course. In this case, we will lose the information on who teaches the fundamental programming course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, there is an &lt;strong&gt;update anomaly&lt;/strong&gt; that occurs when we have to replace all same existing data that belongs to the same data in a data domain. let's take the previous table again as an example. Just imagine that somehow, the lecture that teaches the fundamental programming course (Mr. Marc Whitfield) cannot teach the fundamental programming anymore and have to be replaced by another lecturer, just call him mr. Trystan Mccall. Because of that, we have to replace all lecturer data that belongs to the fundamental programming course (Mr. Marc Whitfield) with mr. Trystan Mccall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some steps to normalize the database table, which are :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#1nf"&gt;1NF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#2nf"&gt;2NF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#3nf"&gt;3NF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#bcnf"&gt;BCNF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#4nf"&gt;4NF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#5nf"&gt;5NF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1nf"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1NF &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--j_IACdVq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/aycskzj4samv77l83ox9.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--j_IACdVq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/aycskzj4samv77l83ox9.png" alt="Original Table"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;in order to make the table satisfy the first normal form, there is one simple rule that has to be applied for each table, which is to make every attribute or column in each table store a single &lt;strong&gt;atomic data, not a group of data&lt;/strong&gt;. In the example above, a student have more than one course which is violae the first normal form. we can separate those course data into different rows without the loss of the student and lecturer information, so the table will look like this. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--w5olhIBt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vmo77iknxabqldfze8au.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--w5olhIBt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vmo77iknxabqldfze8au.png" alt="First Normal Form Table"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The table above satisfies the first normal form of a database table, but there is partial dependency and transitive dependency which will be discussed in the higher normal form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2nf"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2NF &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to make the table satisfy the second normal form, the table must be in the first normal form. Then, there is an additional rule, the table has &lt;strong&gt;no partial dependency&lt;/strong&gt;. Partial dependency is the dependency of a non-primary attribute which only on a part of a composite primary key, not a whole composite primary key. In the previous table, there is a composite primary key formed by &lt;em&gt;student_number&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;course_code&lt;/em&gt; attribute. There are some attributes that depend only on one primary key, such as &lt;em&gt;student_name&lt;/em&gt; that depends only on the &lt;em&gt;student_number&lt;/em&gt; attribute, and &lt;em&gt;course_name&lt;/em&gt; that depends only on the &lt;em&gt;course_code&lt;/em&gt;. These attributes violate the second normal form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get rid of that problem, we have to &lt;strong&gt;separate the partial dependent attribute&lt;/strong&gt; into a new table with the corresponding primary key. So, the tables will look like this.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TgyVEXKK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/t1gmgrj4jmrxkk8sohym.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TgyVEXKK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/t1gmgrj4jmrxkk8sohym.png" alt="Second Normal Form Tables"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3nf"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3NF &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to make the table satisfy the third normal form, the table must be in the second normal form. Then, there is an additional rule, the table has &lt;strong&gt;no transitive dependency&lt;/strong&gt;. Transitive dependency is the dependency of a non-primary attribute on another non-primary attribute. In the previous table, we get rid of student_name and course name that depends on one of the composite primary key, but what about the &lt;em&gt;lecturer_name&lt;/em&gt; attribute? it doesn't depend on any of a composite primary key, but instead, it depends on &lt;em&gt;lecturer_code&lt;/em&gt; which is not a part of composite primary key nor a single primary key itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to convert the table to satisfy the third normal form, we have to &lt;strong&gt;separate the transitive dependent attribute&lt;/strong&gt; into a new table with the corresponding primary key, so the table will look like this.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wHg6WZQN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vk2ix5d2i1h3kwac7x5f.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wHg6WZQN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vk2ix5d2i1h3kwac7x5f.png" alt="Third Normal Form Table"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#bcnf-boycecodd-normal-form"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form) &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The table should be converted to BCNF only if the table is in the third normal form and &lt;strong&gt;every determinant attribute in the table is a candidate key&lt;/strong&gt;. In the previous table, besides the &lt;em&gt;student_number&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;course_code&lt;/em&gt; that were chosen to be a composite key, there is also another determinant attribute that is also a candidate key, that is &lt;em&gt;lecturer_code&lt;/em&gt;, but for some reason, it was not chosen to be a part of the composite primary key. If we observe, one course can be taught by many lecturers, but one lecturer only teaches one course, which means that the course depends on another non-primary key attribute. This condition obviously violates the BCNF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To convert the table into a BCNF, we can &lt;strong&gt;modify the composite primary key&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;em&gt;student_number&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;course_code&lt;/em&gt; into &lt;em&gt;student_number&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;lecturer_code&lt;/em&gt;, then we move attribute course code into the lecturer's table. Therefore, there is no candidate key and the tables will look like this.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OxpZJS0E--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wvb9xagfam7mzbe91ogq.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OxpZJS0E--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wvb9xagfam7mzbe91ogq.png" alt="Boyce-Codd Normal Form"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4nf"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4NF &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve the fourth normal level of a database table, the table must have &lt;strong&gt;no multivalued dependency&lt;/strong&gt;. Multivalued dependency is a dependency of two or more non-primary keys on a primary key or composite of it, where these non-primary keys are independent of each other. Let's take another example in the table below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HrE18MBC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4590ffbhuljq3z8nvnds.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HrE18MBC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4590ffbhuljq3z8nvnds.png" alt="Multivalued Dependency Example"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In that table, there are language and skill attribute that depend on the same primary key (EmployeeId), but those attributes are not related to each other. In other words, the dependency of those attributes violates the fourth normal form of the database table. To deal with this, we can &lt;strong&gt;separate both dependent attribut&lt;/strong&gt; into a new table with the primary key, so the table will look like this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0qqLmRvz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5pri7ky51x11tkjb9ytr.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0qqLmRvz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5pri7ky51x11tkjb9ytr.png" alt="Fourth Normal Form Tables"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5nf"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5NF &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The table can satisfy the fifth normal form if the table is in the fourth normal form and &lt;strong&gt;the table cannot be decomposed into some smaller tables without losing some information&lt;/strong&gt;. It's a bit complicated to understand, but let's try to take a look at the table of relationship between brand, distributor and the customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1XXRgtGO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3osrriz0rp36sx1xppki.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1XXRgtGO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3osrriz0rp36sx1xppki.png" alt="Original Table"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;There are some relationships that exist between the data, such as distributors that sell stuff with a certain brand name, customers that buy stuff from distributors, and customers that buy stuff with a certain brand name. Let's try to decompose the table into three different tables that represent those relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7Chsm2_G--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/11ns2h2or8xppgb6nngf.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7Chsm2_G--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/11ns2h2or8xppgb6nngf.png" alt="Decomposed Table"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; From the Brand Customer table, we can see that Reggie Pearson buys stuff with brand ASUS. Now let's find out from which distributor Reggie Pearson buys ASUS stuff. If we observe the Distributor Customer Table, Reggie Pearson only buys stuff from distributors AAX, KGR, and BGC. If we observe the Brand Distributor table, only distributors AAX, KGR, and BGC that sell ASUS stuff. From this information, we know that Reggie Pearson might buy ASUS stuff from distributors AAX, KGR, or BGC, but if we take a look back at the original table, Reggie Pearson only buys ASUS stuff from distributor AAX. This misleading information might be caused by some conditions, maybe there is someone that buy ASUS stuff from distributor KGR and BGC, or maybe there is another brand that bought by Reggie Pearson from distributor KGR and BGC. That's why we cannot decompose the original table into some smaller tables because we lose information on who is actually buying stuff with which brand name from which distributor. In other words, the original table already satisfies the fifth normal form.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Generating accessor methods easily</title>
      <author>masaushi</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 17 Oct 2021 05:16:29 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/masaushi/generating-accessor-methods-easily-3p61</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;br&gt;
I have made a go tool to generate accessor methods(getter or setter) for unexported struct fields, so let me introduce it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/masaushi/accessory"&gt;https://github.com/masaushi/accessory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag-github-readme-tag"&gt;
  &lt;div class="readme-overview"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;
      &lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--i3JOwpme--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev.to/assets/github-logo-ba8488d21cd8ee1fee097b8410db9deaa41d0ca30b004c0c63de0a479114156f.svg" alt="GitHub logo"&gt;
      &lt;a href="https://github.com/masaushi"&gt;
        masaushi
      &lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://github.com/masaushi/accessory"&gt;
        accessory
      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;
      accessor methods generator for Go programming language
    &lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="ltag-github-body"&gt;
    
&lt;div id="readme" class="md"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
accessory&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/masaushi/accessory/actions/workflows/test.yml"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KcZire5P--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://github.com/masaushi/accessory/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg" alt="test"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/masaushi/accessory/actions/workflows/release.yml"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NL7Nc4l7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://github.com/masaushi/accessory/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg" alt="release"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;accessory is an accessor generator for &lt;a href="https://golang.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Go programming language&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
What is accessory?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accessory is a tool that generates accessor methods from any structs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you might make struct fields unexported in order for values of fields not to be accessed
or modified from anywhere in your codebases, and define getters or setters for values to be handled in a desired way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But writing accessors for so many fields is time-consuming, but not exciting or creative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accessory frees you from tedious, monotonous tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the latest released version&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
Go version &amp;lt; 1.16&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell position-relative overflow-auto js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;go get github.com/masaushi/accessory&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
Go 1.16+&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell position-relative overflow-auto js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;go install github.com/masaushi/accessory@latest&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
Declare Struct with &lt;code&gt;accessor&lt;/code&gt; Tag&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;accessory&lt;/code&gt; generates accessor methods from defined structs, so you need to declare a struct and fields with &lt;code&gt;accessor&lt;/code&gt; tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Values for &lt;code&gt;accessor&lt;/code&gt; tag is &lt;code&gt;getter&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;setter&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;getter&lt;/code&gt; is for generating getter method and &lt;code&gt;setter&lt;/code&gt; is for setter methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="gh-btn-container"&gt;&lt;a class="gh-btn" href="https://github.com/masaushi/accessory"&gt;View on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you might make struct fields unexported in order for values of the fields not to be accessed or modified from anywhere in your codebases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making struct fields unexported will prevent data from unexpected use or change.&lt;br&gt;
But you sometimes might need accessor methods for some fields to get/set data in a desired way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, writing accessors for many fields is time-consuming, but not exciting or creative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tool frees you from that tedious, monotonous task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#example"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Example
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-declare-a-model-with-raw-accessor-endraw-tag"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Declare a model with &lt;code&gt;accessor&lt;/code&gt; tag.
&lt;/h5&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight go"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;MyStruct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;field1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="s"&gt;`accessor:"getter"`&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;field2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="s"&gt;`accessor:"setter"`&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;field3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Time&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;`accessor:"getter,setter"`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-run-raw-accessory-endraw-command"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Run &lt;code&gt;accessory&lt;/code&gt; command
&lt;/h5&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;accessory &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-type&lt;/span&gt; MyStruct &lt;span class="nb"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-accessor-methods-will-be-generated"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Accessor methods will be generated.
&lt;/h5&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight go"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MyStruct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Field1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;field1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MyStruct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SetField2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;val&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;field2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;val&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MyStruct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Field3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Time&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;field3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MyStruct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SetField3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;val&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;field3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;val&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-you-can-customize-method-name"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. You can customize method name
&lt;/h5&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight go"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;MyStruct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;field1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;`accessor:"getter:GetFirstField"`&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;field2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="s"&gt;`accessor:"setter:ChangeSecondField"`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Generated methods will be&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight go"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MyStruct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;GetFirstField&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;field1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MyStruct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ChangeSecondField&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;val&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;field2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;val&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-you-can-also-generate-accessors-with-raw-go-generate-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. You can also generate accessors with &lt;code&gt;go generate&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h5&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight go"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;//go:generate accessory -type MyStruct&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;MyStruct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;field1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;`accessor:"getter"`&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;field2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="s"&gt;`accessor:"setter"`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generating accessors easily will save your time and help you focus on writing important business logics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm looking forward to getting your feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a wonderful day!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Force Re-Render a React Component &amp; Should you do it?</title>
      <author>Tapajyoti Bose</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 17 Oct 2021 05:06:33 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/ruppysuppy/how-to-force-re-render-a-react-component-should-you-do-it-5h1p</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/ruppysuppy/how-to-force-re-render-a-react-component-should-you-do-it-5h1p</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;React&lt;/strong&gt; automatically &lt;strong&gt;Re-Renders&lt;/strong&gt; the components whenever any of its &lt;strong&gt;props&lt;/strong&gt; or its &lt;strong&gt;state&lt;/strong&gt; is updated. But quite often beginners &lt;em&gt;(especially me in my early days)&lt;/em&gt; find it quite difficult getting a component &lt;strong&gt;re-rendered&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let's look at the &lt;em&gt;methods we can use to &lt;strong&gt;re-render&lt;/strong&gt; a component&lt;/em&gt;, and discuss &lt;em&gt;whether we should really force a &lt;strong&gt;re-render&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; or let &lt;strong&gt;React&lt;/strong&gt; take care of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#rerender-a-class-component"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Re-Render a Class Component
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Class Components&lt;/strong&gt; provide you a &lt;strong&gt;built-in method&lt;/strong&gt; to trigger a &lt;strong&gt;Re-Render&lt;/strong&gt;. Simply use &lt;code&gt;forceUpdate&lt;/code&gt; method to force &lt;strong&gt;React&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;Re-Render&lt;/strong&gt; the component.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forceUpdateHandler&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forceUpdateHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;bind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;forceUpdateHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forceUpdate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forceUpdateHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Change&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Random&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#rerender-a-functional-component"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Re-Render a Functional Component
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, &lt;strong&gt;Functional Component&lt;/strong&gt; doesn't have a &lt;code&gt;forceUpdate&lt;/code&gt; method for ease of use. You can use &lt;code&gt;useState&lt;/code&gt; hook to simulate an update or create a &lt;strong&gt;custom hook&lt;/strong&gt; too.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// forceUpdate hook&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useForceUpdate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// component&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;forceUpdate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useForceUpdate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forceUpdate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Change&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Random&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#should-you-force-rerender-a-react-component"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Should you Force Re-Render a React Component?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for answering the most important question...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#no-no-and-no"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;NO! NO! and NO!!!!!!!!!!&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--riXuMcS---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/erjatgj9qpcfzvjde116.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--riXuMcS---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/erjatgj9qpcfzvjde116.gif" alt="No"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most cases, you DEFINITELY SHOULD NOT &lt;strong&gt;force a re-render&lt;/strong&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few &lt;em&gt;niche cases&lt;/em&gt;, like &lt;strong&gt;modifying a blockchain&lt;/strong&gt; (which only returns a &lt;strong&gt;transaction hash&lt;/strong&gt; and no data), where the &lt;strong&gt;forced re-render&lt;/strong&gt; makes sense to &lt;em&gt;fetch the updated data&lt;/em&gt; from the &lt;strong&gt;blockchain&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#debugging-why-the-component-isnt-updating"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Debugging Why the Component isn't Updating
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's look at some of the common issues why &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;React&lt;/strong&gt; fails to update your components&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;find solutions for them as well&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-incorrectly-updated-state"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Incorrectly Updated State
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's consider the following example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;updateUser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Tom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;updateUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Update&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;App&lt;/code&gt; component would not be &lt;strong&gt;re-rendering&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;em&gt;user's name&lt;/em&gt; even when the &lt;code&gt;Update User&lt;/code&gt; button is clicked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;React&lt;/strong&gt; evaluates state changes by checking its &lt;strong&gt;shallow equality&lt;/strong&gt; (also called &lt;strong&gt;reference equality&lt;/strong&gt;), which checks to see if &lt;em&gt;both the current and the new value for state reference the same object&lt;/em&gt;. In our example, we updated one of the properties of the &lt;strong&gt;user object&lt;/strong&gt;, but we technically made &lt;code&gt;setUser&lt;/code&gt; the same object reference, and thus, &lt;strong&gt;React&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;didn’t perceive any change in its state&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#state"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;React&lt;/strong&gt; documentation&lt;/a&gt; mentions, &lt;em&gt;State should be treated as immutable&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how do we fix it? We could &lt;em&gt;create a new object with the updated values&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;updateUser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Tom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-incorrectly-updated-props-without-state-change"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Incorrectly Updated Props (without state change)
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incorrectly updating props without a state change can also leads to bugs. Let’s look at an example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// setInterval(() =&amp;gt; {&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//   console.log(time)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// }, 1000);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;intervalId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;clearInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;intervalId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Clock&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Clock&lt;/code&gt; in the example doesn't update the &lt;code&gt;time&lt;/code&gt; after the first load. To confirm that the &lt;code&gt;time&lt;/code&gt; is being properly updated, you can just un-comment the &lt;code&gt;console.log&lt;/code&gt;. Every second, &lt;em&gt;the runtime will update the variable &lt;code&gt;time&lt;/code&gt;, which is then passed to our &lt;code&gt;Clock&lt;/code&gt; component for rendering&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the state changes, &lt;code&gt;App&lt;/code&gt; (parent component) is &lt;strong&gt;re-rendered&lt;/strong&gt;, thus triggering a &lt;strong&gt;re-rendered&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;code&gt;Clock&lt;/code&gt; (child component) with the updated &lt;code&gt;time&lt;/code&gt;. Thus &lt;em&gt;updating state is what actually triggers the re-render&lt;/em&gt;, which is then &lt;em&gt;propagated through the props&lt;/em&gt;. So updating the state is ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to fix the issue, we could use the following:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;intervalId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;clearInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;intervalId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[])&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Clock&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

  Wrapping up
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like everything in this world, this article too has to end 😛 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the article, we went through some of the ways you can &lt;strong&gt;force re-render&lt;/strong&gt; your &lt;strong&gt;React&lt;/strong&gt; Components as well as the common causes of why &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;React&lt;/strong&gt; fails to re-render the components&lt;/em&gt;. Hope this helps you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best of Luck with your React Development Journey!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Add Power Off and Reboot to grub menu</title>
      <author>Dhananjay Tanpure</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 17 Oct 2021 04:57:04 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/dtan13/add-power-off-and-reboot-to-grub-menu-a45</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/dtan13/add-power-off-and-reboot-to-grub-menu-a45</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;To add &lt;strong&gt;Power Off&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Reboot&lt;/strong&gt; options to grub menu, you need to update a file in your grub configuration directory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; /etc/grub.d
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#open-raw-40custom-endraw-in-your-favorite-editor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Open &lt;code&gt;40_custom&lt;/code&gt; in your favorite editor
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me its &lt;code&gt;micro&lt;/code&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;micro 40_custom
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#add-following-line-at-the-end-of-the-file"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Add following line at the end of the file
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
 menuentry &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Reboot"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      reboot
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

menuentry &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Power Off"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      halt
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not change the &lt;code&gt;exec tail&lt;/code&gt; line in the file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#update-your-raw-grubcfg-endraw-file"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Update your &lt;code&gt;grub.cfg&lt;/code&gt; file
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  For Debian based distros
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;update-grub
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  For Arch based and Other distros
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;grub-mkconfig &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-o&lt;/span&gt; /boot/grub/grub.cfg
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Improve your productivity as a developer</title>
      <author>Dylan Oh</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 17 Oct 2021 04:38:27 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/ohdylan/improve-your-productivity-as-a-developer-22kc</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/ohdylan/improve-your-productivity-as-a-developer-22kc</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are in the era of information explosion. People are tend to have poor concentration and cause low productivity nowadays. As a developer, our main role is to create great product in the least possible time. However, how can we improve and become the best productive self at work / on project? These are my personal experience for improving productivity and I hope it helps you too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Planning before execution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we are new, we tend to jump straight into execution of tasks without planning. This is one of the most valuable lessons that I have learnt from my senior (shout-out to Jessie) when I first joined the company. Always, always, always plan before you start coding / working on the tasks. We usually find ourselves got stuck in the middle of writing codes, and have to rewrite a huge chunk of code after realising that the logic that we structured our codes was wrong. We can start with pseudocodes, and that always helps to visualise the overall big picture for the task. Besides, it is easier to amend pseudocodes. After you have sorted out the logic, all that left is to execute and transform them into codes. If you take 80% of your time to plan them carefully, you will only need the remaining 20% to execute. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Breakdown tasks and set deadline for each of the task&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons that leads to procrastination is that we are not sure where to start with when looking at a large task / project, for example building your portfolio website. What we have to do to overcome this is to break down this large task into smaller pieces, and set a firmed deadline to each of them. Take building portfolio website as an example, we can split that into sourcing assets for your website, UI Design &amp;amp; wireframing, transforming the design into UI Components, etc. Meanwhile, UI components can be further broken down into NavBar, Button, Card and so on. By creating the workflow and making a gigantic task into more manageable tasks, we tend not to procrastinate our works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Deep work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing codes is a task that requires deep focus. Personally, I have to manage projects and provide technical supports sometimes other than coding. You might get a lot of interruptions, and it takes time to get back to the state of focus. The way that I deal with this is that I switch off all the notifications from email, messages and other apps for 2 hours and just focus on coding. You might be surprised on how much you could achieve by deep focusing for just 2 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Environment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Environment of working is an element of boosting productivity as well, especially for those who are working from home. It is important to separate working and relaxing area. My room is the only place I can work + study + rest at home (I am currently renting a room). Therefore, unless I am forced to work at home, I would prefer to go to office so that I have a better environment for work. Besides, keep your mobile phone away, and set an alarm clock to get some rest after working a period of time. You can also play some white noise in the background and that really helps me focusing more on my tasks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. If you feel like you cannot focus, go for a short walk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not force yourself to sit in front of desk when you are in a state where you cannot focus. There are times where we were just staring at the screen and our brain is just not functioning at all. Go for a walk, meditate or taking a shower might help to reboot your system and get back to work in a better state.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Divtober Day 16: Snow</title>
      <author>Alvaro Montoro</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 17 Oct 2021 04:37:35 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/alvaromontoro/divtober-day-16-snow-18bb</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/alvaromontoro/divtober-day-16-snow-18bb</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I did two different entries for snow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One that will make your computer fan work like it has never been working before&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another that would be 1,000 easier and better in SVG (again!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll put the one that requires a lot of CPU at the bottom, in the hopes that if you don't scroll down, it won't load and mess things up with your computer. It's basically a single-element snow fall effect with CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first: a sad (but kind of cute) abominable snow man:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/alvaromontoro/embed/ExvPOGo?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now the snow fall: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/alvaromontoro/embed/WNErYxV?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has to be possible to simplify the snowfall so it doesn't require so many things (and maybe then, it will go smoother)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>x86 vs x64 systems for roadrunners</title>
      <author>Tharun Shiv</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 17 Oct 2021 03:59:17 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/developertharun/x86-vs-x64-systems-for-roadrunners-1nle</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/developertharun/x86-vs-x64-systems-for-roadrunners-1nle</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;🎧 &lt;em&gt;Listen to this episode&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="100%" height="232px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/275bf1xKuQ0HbGPrAIVwC4"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#x86-systems"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  x86 Systems
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;x86 is a generic name that is used to refer to all Intel processors that were released after the original 8086 or 8088 variant of Intel processors. The variants like 80286, 80386, 80486 so on.. were named using the convention x86, where the 80 is implicit, and x can be replaced with a number conveniently. These are backward compatible systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8086 or 8088 are the various names that are used to Identify the microprocessors of Intel that were released in the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#registers-used-in-the-early-x86-systems"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Registers used in the early x86 systems
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Register is a tiny memory holding electronic device that is used by the processor to either store instructions, data or address. These are fundamental units that are used when executing a computer instruction to perform a task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;x86 systems ranged from 8-bit, 16-bit and then 32bit. What do these bits refer to? They are the highest number of bits in a single register that exists in the system.&lt;br&gt;
Maximum memory limit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we say 32-bit, the number will contain 32 digits with each of them being either 0 or 1. The number system used here is Binary System ( power 2 ). Hence, the maximum possible value here will be 2³², which is 42,94,967,295. These are the maximum number of memory locations that a 32-bit register can access. We can only attach that memory device which the register can completely make use of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, a 32-bit register can cater a maximum of 4GB of RAM. This is because, if each memory location that the register points to can hold 1 byte of data, then 42,94,967,295 bytes = 4.29 G. Although this is theoretical, the actual RAM that can be used will be less than around 3.5G, because of certain parts of the register being used to store other types of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#x64-systems"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  x64 Systems
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the systems that evolved to use 64-bit registers, they initially named it x86–64, but since this sounds longer, the naming was changed to x64 systems. x64 is a generic name that is used to refer to all Intel processors that are 64-bit processors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The x64 systems as mentioned above contains registers that are even capable of storing 64bits in a single register.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#theoretical-maximum-memory-limit"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Theoretical Maximum memory limit
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we say 64-bit, the number will contain 64 digits with each of them being either 0 or 1. The number system used here will be Binary system just like the 32-bit family. Hence, the maximum possible value here will be 2⁶⁴.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus each 64-bit register can cater a maximum of around 18 Quintillion bytes of memory. ( One Quintillion is 10¹⁸ ). Therefore it will be able to handle the usual RAM that we come across everyday effortlessly, including enterprise production servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#processing-power-of-x64-systems"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Processing power of x64 systems
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;x64 systems come with configurations like dual core, quad core, octa core and so on, which depicts the number of processors that work simultaneously in an integrated circuit. This enables the Operating system to perform tasks parallely. While dual-core has two cores than one single core, every task that it does need not be twice as fast as a single core machine. This is because, even the operating systems and programs that is using the processors should be able to perform parallely using multi processors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#current-generation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Current generation
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently the popular architecture is to use the 64-bit system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roadrunners is a series that is aimed at delivering concepts as precise as possible. Here, a roadrunner is referred to a person who does things super fast &amp;amp; efficient. Are you a roadrunner?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
