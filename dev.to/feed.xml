      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you start looking into a career in cybersecurity, one of the biggest things you will quickly learn is how important Kali Linux is to cybersecurity professionals and especially professional penetration testers. In case you’re not familiar with this very interesting version of Linux, in this article, we’ll dive into what exactly Kali Linux is and discuss the best way to learn this penetration testing swiss army knife operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;What is Kali Linux?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kali Linux (formerly known as BackTrack Linux) is an open-source, Debian-based Linux distribution aimed at advanced Penetration Testing and Security Auditing. Kali Linux contains several hundred tools targeted towards various information security tasks, such as Penetration Testing, Security Research, Computer Forensics and Reverse Engineering. Kali Linux is a multi-platform solution, accessible and freely available to information security professionals and hobbyists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kali Linux was released on the 13th March 2013 as a complete, top-to-bottom rebuild of BackTrack Linux, adhering completely to Debian development standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;A brief history of Kali Linux&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kali Linux was released in 2013 by the organization Offensive Security, which also offers cybersecurity training and certifications.  Offensive Security took the pre-existing security-focused Backtrack Linux and redeveloped it into Kali based on the Debian variant of Linux.  Kali Linux is free and it is made very clear that it will always be free. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Is Kali Linux illegal?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kali Linux is not illegal by itself. After all, it is just an OS. It is however a tool for hacking too and when someone uses it especially for hacking, it is illegal. It is legal If you install it for useful purposes like learning, or teaching, or using it in the way to fortify your software or your network as It is not illegal to install any Operating System which is licensed and available for download.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;How to install Kali Linux?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kali Linux installation is a fairly simple process and you have multiple installation options. Most preferred ones include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Installing Kali Linux by making a Kali (Linux) bootable USB drive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kali Linux hard disk install&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using virtualization software, such as VMware or VirtualBox&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dual booting Kali Linux with the operating system&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;System Requirements for Kali Linux- (How much RAM does Kali Linux need?)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All you have to make sure is that you have compatible hardware. Kali is supported on i386, amd64, and ARM (both ARMEL and ARMHF) platforms. The hardware requirements are minimal as listed below, although better hardware will naturally provide better performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A minimum of 20 GB disk space for the Kali Linux install.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;RAM for i386 and amd64 architectures, minimum: 1GB, recommended: 2GB or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;CD-DVD Drive / USB boot support/ VirtualBox&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Why do hackers use Kali Linux?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mBUgp_Nz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1625751737966/dI1ZAD9Ky.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mBUgp_Nz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1625751737966/dI1ZAD9Ky.jpeg" alt="1_3kQeDluVlgMzRTEtoL208w.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously known as Backtrack, Kali Linux advertises itself as a more polished successor with more testing-centric tools, unlike Backtrack which had multiple tools that would serve the same purpose, in turn, making it jampacked with unnecessary utilities. This makes ethical hacking using Kali Linux a simplified task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Why do cybersecurity professionals prefer Kali Linux?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest reasons cyber professionals use and often prefer Kali Linux is the fact that all of the source code is open-source, meaning that the system can be tweaked to the liking of the cybersecurity professional that is using it.  This is not necessarily done often, it does provide the option to personalize Kali for specific cybersecurity tasks. Kali Linux also comes with multi-language support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, up until 2019 Kali Linux had been designed to be used for single root user access, meaning that the user is given full rights and access to everything.  This was recently changed to accommodate users that were using Kali Linux more often than just for cybersecurity purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The cyber advantage of using Kali Linux&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those were just a few examples of the popular applications that come pre-installed on Kali Linux. While it is true that all of the applications on Kali Linux are free and can be downloaded on other operating systems, Kali Linux makes it a lot easier for the user by doing all of the work for you and compiling them in one operating system distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Kali Linux Features&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
&lt;b&gt;More than 600 penetration testing tools included: &lt;/b&gt;After reviewing every tool that was included in BackTrack, we eliminated a great number of tools that either simply did not work or which duplicated other tools that provided the same or similar functionality. Details on what’s included are on the Kali Tools site.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Free (as in beer) and always will be:&lt;/b&gt; Kali Linux, like BackTrack, is completely free of charge and always will be. You will never, ever have to pay for Kali Linux.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Open source Git tree: &lt;/b&gt;We are committed to the open-source development model and our development tree is available for all to see. All of the source code which goes into Kali Linux is available for anyone who wants to tweak or rebuild packages to suit their specific needs.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Wide-ranging wireless device support:&lt;/b&gt; A regular sticking point with Linux distributions has been supported for wireless interfaces. We have built Kali Linux to support as many wireless devices as we possibly can, allowing it to run properly on a wide variety of hardware and making it compatible with numerous USB and other wireless devices.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Developed in a secure environment:&lt;/b&gt; The Kali Linux team is made up of a small group of individuals who are the only ones trusted to commit packages and interact with the repositories, all of which is done using multiple secure protocols.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
&lt;b&gt;GPG signed packages and repositories: &lt;/b&gt;Every package in Kali Linux is signed by each developer who built and committed it, and the repositories subsequently sign the packages as well.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Multi-language support:&lt;/b&gt; Although penetration tools tend to be written in English, we have ensured that Kali includes true multilingual support, allowing more users to operate in their native language and locate the tools they need for the job.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Completely customizable: &lt;/b&gt;We thoroughly understand that not everyone will agree with our design decisions, so we have made it as easy as possible for our more adventurous users to customize Kali Linux to their liking, all the way down to the kernel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion and Key Points&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Keep in mind that Kali Linux, while not overly complicated, isn’t exactly for beginners, so take your time as you work through the tools.  Try to learn at least one new thing each day.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If you’re new to the world of Linux, consider starting with another Linux system like Ubuntu to get a taste of what you would be getting into.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Never attempt to use the tools in Kali Linux against any system which are not authorized to access.  There are plenty of legally free systems out there to practice your skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading 😊&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Build a human-like conversational AI app in an hour</title>
      <author>Arthur Grishkevich</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/arrrgr/build-a-human-like-conversational-ai-app-in-an-hour-3031</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Folks who work in insurance will tell you that it’s about as far from a sexy industry as one can get. Call me narrow-minded but I think any industry can be made sexier with a bit of AI. In today’s tutorial we will do just that: build a conversational AI app that will take a customer’s call, check their policy number and answer a few questions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prestart"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Pre-start
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is your first time building a conversational AI app with Dasha, you want to join our &lt;a href="https://community.dasha.ai"&gt;developer community&lt;/a&gt;. This is where you will find all the answers to all of your questions (42). Also, as we are in a closed developer beta right now, this is where we will give you your API key to use Dasha. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the app you will build today: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/46nyWBTSHgs"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin building with Dasha you will need to have Visual Studio Code, NPM and Node.js installed, ideally in their latest versions. Now do the following: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install the &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dasha-ai.dashastudio&amp;amp;ssr=false"&gt;Dasha Studio&lt;/a&gt; VSCode extension&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the terminal in VSCode and install Dasha command line interface &lt;code&gt;npm i -g "@dasha.ai/cli"&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now, run the command &lt;code&gt;dasha account login&lt;/code&gt; and follow the browser prompt when it pops up. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should probably join our &lt;a href="https://community.dasha.ai"&gt;developer community&lt;/a&gt; we obsess over answering all our community members ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you prefer video tutorials, here you go: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;%[&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H22H-WBdZko"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H22H-WBdZko&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conversation-structure"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conversation structure
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order for you to better understand the conversation flow of what we are building, here is the basic structure of the conversational AI app. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#perfect-world-conversation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Perfect world conversation
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The user/customer calls in and asks to confirm some information about the insurance policy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AI asks for their policy number. The AI then reads the policy number back out to the user to confirm it. If the number is confirmed, Dasha looks up account details. If such an account exists, it tells the user as much and asks what they are after. If no such account exists, it tells the user as much. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The user may then proceed to ask one of a number of questions, such as, “does my policy cover accidents” or “what is the status of my claim”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s pretty much it. Sounds simple enough. Before we get to the app, let’s go over the Dasha AI Platform architecture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dasha-ai-platform-architecture"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Dasha AI Platform architecture
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three main parts to the product which makes building, training, developing and maintaining your human-like conversational apps possible. They are - Dasha Studio, Dasha SDK and Dasha Platform. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KeLeGAqK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/izs76ymbgie7807bel0t.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KeLeGAqK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/izs76ymbgie7807bel0t.png" alt="Dasha architecture"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dasha-studio"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Dasha Studio
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is an extension to VSCode. You use the Studio to create your conversational workflow, provide data to train the neural networks to recognize intents, define ways in which the AI is to respond to the user, as it is talking to the user. The Studio lets you create these apps using DashaScript, an event-driven, domain-specific language derived from TypeScript. In essence, DashaScript is a collection of commands which tell the AI services in the Dasha Cloud Platform how to behave in various situations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dasha-sdk"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Dasha SDK
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is a library used to integrate your applications or services to the Dasha Cloud. It uses GRPC for two way communication between your application and Dasha Cloud Platform &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dasha-cloud-platform"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Dasha Cloud Platform
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dasha Cloud is where the magic happens. It provides the AI-as-a-Service components which enable you to create apps that are wildly human-like in the way they interact with users. Best in class speech to text, text to speech, natural language processing, understanding and generation, all come as a service of the Dasha Platform. And we are constantly improving existing services and building new ones. With any application you build using our technology, you will have access to all the newest updates. For more details on the Cloud Platform’s services, peek &lt;a href="https://dasha.ai/en-us/blog/dasha-conversational-ai-as-a-service"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-insurance-customer-service-conversational-ai-app"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The insurance customer service conversational AI app
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and open the &lt;a href="https://github.com/arrrgr/insurance-customer-service-demo"&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt; to the application in your VSCode. You can either clone and open the app in your terminal or download, unzip and open the folder in VSCode using File &amp;gt; Open. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will now want to open four files. These are essentially what make your conversational AI app built with Dasha possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#indexjs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  index.js
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the Node.js file from which your conversational AI application is launched. You use index.js to load the Dasha SDK. By the same token, you can incorporate this file, or the code which launches your application into any other Node.js project, from whence you wish to make use of the Dasha Cloud to run conversational apps. In this case, you will obviously need to include the Dasha application code in a separate folder. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is the JavaScript code you would use to launch a basic Dasha SDK connection and Dasha app:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dasha&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@dasha.ai/sdk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dasha&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;deploy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;connectionProvider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;conv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;conv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;phone&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;chat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dasha&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;chat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dasha&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;chat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createConsoleChat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dasha&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dasha&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Endpoint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ttsDispatcher&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;dasha&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;conv&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createConversation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;phone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;argv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;??&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;argv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;??&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;conv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;phone&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;chat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;conv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;transcription&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;conv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;transcription&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;entry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;logFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;appendFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;entry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;speaker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;entry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;\n`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;conv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;debugLog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;msgId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;RecognizedSpeechMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;logEntry&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;facts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;logFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;appendFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;logEntry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;conv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;output&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dispose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;logFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#maindsl"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  main.dsl
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main.dsl&lt;/strong&gt; is located in the &lt;strong&gt;/app/&lt;/strong&gt; directory. This is the DashaScript file which gets compiled and executed in the Dasha Cloud Platform. This file contains all the instructions that you provide to the Dasha AI Cloud on how to run your application. In essence, this is the conversational structure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#datajson"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  data.json
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data.json&lt;/strong&gt; is the super-power file. It gives you the super power of training neural networks with simple JSON datasets. It is used for two things mainly - to define &lt;a href="https://dasha.ai/en-us/blog/intent-classification"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;intents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - ways of helping the AI to understand what real meaning the user places into their replies and &lt;a href="https://dasha.ai/en-us/blog/named-entity-recognition"&gt;named entities&lt;/a&gt; - data points located within the user’s replies. You can read more about both functions at the links above. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#phrasemapjson"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  phrasemap.json
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phrasemap.json&lt;/strong&gt; is another superpower file. Here you instruct what phrases your AI app should use in responding to the user. You can also instruct it to vary the phrases, to say different things if the same node gets called up a second or third time, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#understanding-the-conversational-ai-app"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Understanding the conversational AI app
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve got a high-level overview of the technology and the files you are working with, let’s look at &lt;strong&gt;main.dsl&lt;/strong&gt; more closely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#run-a-test"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Run a test
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start off, let’s launch a test conversation. To do so, you will need to have the &lt;a href="https://github.com/arrrgr/insurance-customer-service-demo"&gt;code&lt;/a&gt; open in your VSCode. Run &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm i&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Now, run &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm start chat&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. A chat session will launch in your terminal. You can also run &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm start 12223334455&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; where &lt;em&gt;12223334455&lt;/em&gt; is your phone number in international format. You will get a call from the AI and can talk to it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s look at the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#imports-and-declarations"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Imports and declarations
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We start off by importing the library of commonly used digressions, intents, etc. By the way, digressions are nodes that can be called up at any point in the conversation. They do not have a node leading into them. Digressions are great for two things. One is preparing your AI appfor a variety of tangents which a human user might bring up in the course of a conversation. Two is letting you teach your AI app to say something along the lines of “how can I help you today” and then listen in for a response. You can read more about digressions &lt;a href="https://dasha.ai/en-us/blog/using-digressions"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we declare context variables - &lt;strong&gt;input&lt;/strong&gt; (ones that are pushed to the app on conversation start) and &lt;strong&gt;storage&lt;/strong&gt; ones. Following this, we declare external functions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;External functions are a way to pass and receive arguments to and from the &lt;strong&gt;index.js&lt;/strong&gt; file, in which the Dasha app runs as a function. You can in turn write instructions on what to do with these arguments, for example, calculations or, more importantly, you can push data to or pull data from an external service from the Node.js file. Or both. In the app you are looking at now we make use of external functions and will go over it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will paste examples of code. Unfortunately, due to the nature of Dasha apps, these code snippets do not pass the copy-paste test, as they need multiple files to run. As you have opened the &lt;a href="https://github.com/arrrgr/insurance-customer-service-demo"&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt;, you can run the entire code base.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import "commonReactions/all.dsl";

context 
{
    // declare input variables here
    input phone: string;

    // declare storage variables here 
    name: string = ""; 
    policy_number: string = ""; 
    policy_read: string = "";
    policy_status: string = "";
    rating: string = "";
    feedback: string = "";
    claim: string = "";
}

// declare external functions here 
external function check_policy(policy_number: string): string;
external function convert_policy(policy_number: string): string;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conversation-flow"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conversation flow
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversation starts in earnest with line 22. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We kick it off with a starting node named &lt;strong&gt;root&lt;/strong&gt;. Once the connection is established, the AI says the &lt;code&gt;__”greeting”__&lt;/code&gt; phrase, as indicated in the &lt;strong&gt;phrasemap.json&lt;/strong&gt;. In the greeting phrase it asks for a name. Upon finding the data &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, as defined in &lt;strong&gt;data.json&lt;/strong&gt;, the conversation moves to the next node. In &lt;code&gt;node node_2&lt;/code&gt;, we store the collected name data in the previously defined storage variable &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; and then use it to greet the user by their name.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;start node root
{
   do //actions executed in this node
   {
       #connectSafe($phone); // connecting to the phone number which is specified in index.js that it can also be in-terminal text chat
       #waitForSpeech(1000); // give the person a second to start speaking
       #say("greeting"); // and greet them. Refer to phrasemap.json &amp;gt; "greeting"
       wait *; // wait for a response
   }
   transitions // specifies to which nodes the conversation goes from here
   {
       node_2: goto node_2 on #messageHasData("name"); // when Dasha identifies that the user's phrase contains "name" data, as specified in the named entities section of data.json, a transfer to node node_2 happens
   }
}

node node_2
{
   do
   {
       set $name =  #messageGetData("name")[0]?.value??""; //assign variable $name with the value extracted from the user's previous statement
       #log($name);
       #say("pleased_meet", {name: $name} );
       wait*;
   }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, please refer to &lt;strong&gt;phrasemap.json&lt;/strong&gt; to see how the phrases are defined. You can see that we provide an alternate phrase under the label &lt;code&gt;”repeat”&lt;/code&gt;. This lets Dasha know that if it comes back to the same node a second time, a different phrase must be used. Note the use of dynamic variables in &lt;code&gt;node node_2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;”pleased_meet”&lt;/code&gt; phrase. Note that you can also define phrases directly and use dynamic variables in the body of main.dsl using the &lt;a href="https://docs.dasha.ai/en-us/default/dasha-script-language/built-in-functions?searchResult=p61-highlight-0#saytext-blocking-call"&gt;&lt;code&gt;#sayText()&lt;/code&gt; function&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68737877/how-added-dynamic-data-to-phrasemap/68742493#68742493"&gt;string concatenation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"greeting"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"first"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"text"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;". How can I help you today? "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"repeat"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"text"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"I was just saying. How can I help you today "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"id"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"type"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"dynamic"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"text"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s take a look at &lt;strong&gt;data.json&lt;/strong&gt; to get a grasp of the neural network training data. We are looking at the &lt;strong&gt;named entities&lt;/strong&gt; section of the file. Under &lt;code&gt;”values”&lt;/code&gt; we define the types of names that a person might have. Note that the &lt;code&gt;”open_set”&lt;/code&gt; parameter is set to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;. This means that the AI is free to substitute various other names for the ones we provide to it as an example. To help it recognize where the names can be located in the body of the user’s response, we provide &lt;code&gt;”includes”&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"entities"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"open_set"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"values"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
         &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"value"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Jim Smith"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
         &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"synonyms"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Jim Smith"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
         &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"value"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Tony Montana"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
         &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"synonyms"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Tony Montana"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
         &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"value"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Jill Jones"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
         &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"synonyms"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Jill Jones"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"includes"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"My name is (Tony Montana)[name]"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"My name is (Jill Jones)[name]"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"This is (Jim Smith)[name]"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"(Jim Smith)[name] calling"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"(Jill Jones)[name]"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"I'm (Tony Montana)[name]"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"(Tony Montana)[name]"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moving further down in &lt;strong&gt;main.dsl&lt;/strong&gt; we come upon &lt;code&gt;digression policy_1&lt;/code&gt;. This digression gets called up when the AI identifies intent which corresponds to &lt;code&gt;”policy_check”&lt;/code&gt;, as stated in &lt;strong&gt;data.json&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is where it gets interesting. Take a look at the following three nodes:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;digression policy_1
{
    conditions {on #messageHasIntent("policy_check");}
    do 
    {
        #say("what_policy");  //ask for policy number
        wait*;
    }
    transitions
    {
        policy_2: goto policy_2 on #messageHasData("policy");
    }
}

node policy_2
{
    do 
    {
        set $policy_number = #messageGetData("policy")[0]?.value??""; //set $policy_number wit the value acquired from the user 
        set $policy_read = external convert_policy($policy_number); //call up external function to add spaces between numbers to help the AI read out the numbers more legibly
        #log($policy_read);
        #say("confirm_policy" , {policy_read: $policy_read} ); //read policy number back out to user to confirm it was heard correctly
        wait*;
    }
    transitions
    {
        yes: goto policy_3 on #messageHasIntent("yes");
        no: goto policy_1_a on #messageHasIntent("no");
    }
}

node policy_3
{
    do
    {
        set $policy_status = external check_policy($policy_number); //call up an external function to check the policy 
        #say("verification_result", {policy_status: $policy_status} );
        wait*;
    }
    transitions
    {
        yes: goto can_help on #messageHasIntent("yes");
        no: goto bye_rate on #messageHasIntent("no");
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you can tell from the code and the comments, we ask the user to state their policy number in &lt;code&gt;digression policy_1&lt;/code&gt;, the number is identified as per instructions to the neural networks in &lt;strong&gt;data.json&lt;/strong&gt; under &lt;code&gt;”entities”&lt;/code&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;”policy”&lt;/code&gt;. In &lt;code&gt;node policy_2&lt;/code&gt;, we store the policy number, call up an external function to send the number value to &lt;strong&gt;index.js&lt;/strong&gt;, where we put spaces between the numbers. The reason for this is - a string of numbers that have no spaces between them will be read by Dasha out as the integer value, for example, one thousand fifty, versus one zero five zero. We put the spaces between the numbers, pass the value back to our app and store it as $policy_read. This number is then read out to the user, to confirm that it was heard correctly. If the number is read incorrectly, the AI asks the user to repeat it. If it is confirmed by the user, we go to &lt;code&gt;node policy_3&lt;/code&gt;.  Here we call up an external function to check the policy number and verify that there is an active policy with this number. In the case of this demo, we simply pick one or two outcomes with random chance. In the case of a real application running in production, you will want to integrate with your database and get the data from there.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// external function convert policy number.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setExternal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;convert_policy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;conv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;policyRead&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;policy_number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;policyRead&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;policyRead&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

 &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// external function check policy number. Here we are providing a random evaluation, you will want to refer to your membership database&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setExternal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;check_policy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;conv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;policyNumber&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;policyNumber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;This is a valid policy number. And there is currently one active claim associated with this policy number.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;There is no active policy with this number. I'm sorry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Going back to &lt;code&gt;node policy_3&lt;/code&gt; - if the user has no additional questions, the conversation progresses to &lt;code&gt;node bye_rate&lt;/code&gt;. Before letting the user go, Dasha asks to rate the interaction on the scale of 0 to 10. If the rating is six or below, Dasha will ask the user to clarify what they did not like about the experience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find this code in &lt;strong&gt;main.dsl&lt;/strong&gt; lines 104-177. Below I will only show the code for &lt;code&gt;node rating_evaluation&lt;/code&gt;, as it is the only node dealing with functions that we have not used previously in this tutorial. As you can tell here, we save data collected from the user (rating 0-10) to a variable &lt;code&gt;$rating&lt;/code&gt;, which we then convert to an integer. We have to do this because all user replies are saved as strings by Dasha. We then see whether the rating is greater than or equal to 7 or otherwise. Based on the outcome, the conversation develops.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;node rating_evaluation
{
   do
   {
       set $rating =  #messageGetData("rating")[0]?.value??""; //assign variable $rating with the value extracted from the user's previous statement
       #log($rating);
       var rating_num = #parseInt($rating); // #messageGetData collects data as an array of strings; we convert the string to an integer in order to evaluate whether the rating is positive or negative
       if ( rating_num &amp;gt;=7 )
       {
           goto rate_positive; // note that this function refers to the transition's name, not the node name
       }
       else
       {
           goto rate_negative;
       }
   }
   transitions
   {
       rate_positive: goto rate_positive; // you need to declare transition name and the node it refers to here
       rate_negative: goto rate_negative;
   }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Starting at line 193 and to the end of &lt;strong&gt;main.dsl&lt;/strong&gt;, the remaining digressions begin. These are concerned with the additional questions that a user might ask, once their policy number has been confirmed. These digressions deal with questions such as “what is the status of my insurance claim” and “I’d like to redeem my completed claim.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#in-conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  In conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you have gone through the conversational AI app, make some changes to it and run some tests, using the commands stated earlier. For your reference: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Run &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm i&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Now, run &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm start chat&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. A chat session will launch in your terminal. You can also run &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm start 12223334455&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; where 12223334455 is your phone number in international format. You will get a call from the AI and can talk to it.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us know in the comments or in &lt;a href="https://community.dasha.ai"&gt;Dasha Developer Community&lt;/a&gt; what you build. &lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/andrewbaisden/5-steps-for-performing-well-in-a-new-job-1h5c</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you start a new job it is important that you are well prepared and ready to absorb everything that you can. Those first few months are either going to make you or break you it all comes down to your mindset and how motivated you are to be a success is this new role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have worked in the industry for a few years and during that time I have learned a lot of things. I also recently started a new full-time role as well. Here are 4 steps for performing well in a new job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-ask-lots-of-questions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Ask lots of questions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new job means that there are going to be a lot of unknowns. You need to ask as many questions as possible no matter how arbitrary they might sound. It is better to find out the answers to your questions instead of waiting until the last minute and looking clueless because you decided to hold in all your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your first few months should be all about information gathering. Figuring out how everything works, the people you report to etc... Leave no stone unturned and keep a note of everything that is said. That way you can get up to speed fast on projects which hopefully leads to less hand holding and micro management in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-learn-the-setup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Learn the setup
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every company has a different structure and set of rules to follow. Your coding style might have to be adapted so that you align with your new companies work style. So for example the JavaScript framework setup might not be the same way that you are used to doing it. Some people prefer double quotes and others prefer single quotes. The same applies to writing comments too. The closer your goals align with the company the easier it will be for you to integrate into your new team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also true for GIT workflows, documentation, and testing. Follow the guidelines and specifications outlined by your team and then you will find that you all get along well when working on projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-show-your-worth-to-the-company"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Show your worth to the company
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those first few months tend to be quite hard as you feel the need to prove your value and validate why you deserve the role. Put in a good high work rate and get up to speed as quickly as possible. The more you contribute to the company the less you will have to worry about in the future. Build the groundwork now so that you are good to go for smooth sailing further down the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-have-good-connections"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Have good connections
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area that requires lots of effort would be finding common ground, and bonding well with your team mates. This would come under the area of having a good culture fit. Jobs are not all about working you need to remember that you have to behave as a human too and not just a robot that writes code all day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relationships also make the job more engrossing and leads to the team having a good bond. If you work in an office then it is not too hard to accomplish some of these things it is quite different with remote working though. So have friendly idle talks over IM with your team or having video calls or meetings is quite a good way to keep in touch when it is not possible to be there in person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-put-in-the-time"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Put in the time
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to put in the hours if you want to be a successful developer in your new role. Learn as much as you can about the company and its ethos and find ways to incorporate your learnings so that you can help your team to grow further. This can include learning about new tools, technologies and trends which could benefit the business. And also doing your own self learning so that you can be the best at your job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#final-thoughts"&gt;

      <title>7 VS Code Extensions for Frontend Developers</title>
      <author>Alex Omeyer</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 10:24:23 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/alexomeyer/7-vs-code-extensions-for-frontend-developers-7f8</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/alexomeyer/7-vs-code-extensions-for-frontend-developers-7f8</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a developer, you’re always looking for cutting-edge tools, tricks, and extensions to improve your productivity and efficiency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being able to manage your time better is a valuable skill for software engineers. Therefore, here’s a list of Visual Studio Code extensions that help frontend developers (and not only!) to increase their productivity by at least 10 to 20%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with Sourcery!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-sourcery-for-python"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sourcery.sourcery"&gt;Sourcery for Python&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sourcery is a valuable tool for Python developers who want to improve their coding style. Sourcery is like a personal assistant that gives coding tips on the fly. It will show you how to write better, cleaner Python code by offering refactoring suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extension runs in the background and will highlight snippets of code that can be improved by underlying them in blue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example created by Sourcery that shows how you can refactor a complex if-else statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zH88Tbwt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/af61idwxns7fflpre7it.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zH88Tbwt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/af61idwxns7fflpre7it.gif" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, this extension also comes with a Pro version that offers more functionality like checking for duplicate code sections. It’s an excellent extension for developers looking to improve their coding style with real-time code suggestions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-stepsize-for-todos-amp-tech-debt"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. &lt;a href="https://bitly.stepsize.com/3mALdxy"&gt;Stepsize for TODOs &amp;amp; Tech Debt&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stepsize is an issue tracker inside your editor for managing technical debt and maintenance issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you come across technical debt that should be fixed but you don’t have time to fix it right away, you can &lt;strong&gt;bookmark a piece of code or create an issue&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stepsize allows you to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create &amp;amp; view code issues directly from your editor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track &amp;amp; prioritise code improvements like technical debt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add key issues to your sprints with our Jira integration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with your team to address technical problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how you can bookmark the code and create an issue:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EMtOZCVB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/y05ccgvo4jtdv9p9zvtg.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EMtOZCVB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/y05ccgvo4jtdv9p9zvtg.gif" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a great tool for teams who want to make technical debt visible and start reducing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-quokkajs-for-javascript"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WallabyJs.quokka-vscode"&gt;Quokka.js for JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many developers have probably already heard about Quokka.js, which serves as a quick playground for prototyping code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a developer, I often ended up in a situation where I wanted to test a complex code snippet by prototyping it in a separate file to get more visibility into the inputs and outputs of what I had developed. That meant I had to create a new file, write the code, and execute it each time I made changes. Moreover, I added countless &lt;code&gt;console.log&lt;/code&gt; statements to inspect the data format when moving through the function. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point in my development career, a colleague recommended I start using Quokka.js. It takes away the file creation process and removes the process of logging data at each step. Quokka.js prints the output of each step within your editor and highlights incorrect code via inline reporting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iZbxRzaR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/w4sdmf7jvieaj1avczet.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iZbxRzaR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/w4sdmf7jvieaj1avczet.gif" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, it’s a handy tool for prototyping code, and you can access it from the VSCode’s command palette. However, it’s worth knowing that Quokka.js also comes with a &lt;a href="https://quokkajs.com/pro/"&gt;Pro version&lt;/a&gt; that offers you more features such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Import files from within your project&lt;/strong&gt;: This feature is useful when you prototype some code that requires a helper function or any other function from within your project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quick package install&lt;/strong&gt;: When you want to experiment with an NPM package, you can import it to your Quokka.js file. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Live comments&lt;/strong&gt;: You can use asSpecial comment format to evaluate any expressions. You may also write any JavaScript code right in the comment to shape the output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, Quokka.js is a must-have extension for developers to prototype code rapidly. We don’t want to promote paid subscriptions, yet, Quokka’s Pro version can save you even more time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-ponicode-for-javascript-unit-testing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ponicode.ponicode"&gt;Ponicode for JavaScript Unit Testing&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ponicode is an AI-powered extension pack that generates unit tests for you. It helps you create, visualize, and run unit tests for your functions quickly and easily, thanks to ML-generated test scenarios and an intuitive graphical interface.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can read from Ponicode’s description, the extension supports you in creating unit tests. Not only does it generate unit tests via machine learning algorithms, but it will also show you the most critical paths in your code. This information is crucial when optimizing your testing efforts by focusing on the most essential code paths. In other words, Ponicode optimizes your efforts to increase your code’s robustness and helps to detect critical bugs early. Moreover, Ponicode suggests relevant inputs for your test scenarios to make them even more effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, a GUI allows you to craft unit tests visually and automatically creates test files. It’s definitely a timesaver!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OrGPYGXR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/v0m3qw5xdultwn26d87w.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OrGPYGXR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/v0m3qw5xdultwn26d87w.gif" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, it’s a fantastic extension to save time writing tests for different inputs but also to find the most important code paths in your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-stackfinder-for-stack-overflow"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mark-fobert.stackfinder"&gt;StackFinder for Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost every developer uses Stack Overflow on a daily basis to find answers to their coding questions. It’s one of the most well-known websites for developers. Like myself, I often end up opening Stack Overflow to validate an idea or to find a better solution than the one I’ve created. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To save time, StackFinder allows you to look for answers on Stack Overflow from your VSCode editor. Besides that, you can copy solutions to your editor to try them out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a fast alternative for opening a browser filled with Stack Overflow tabs. Personally, I enjoyed using this solution as I don’t have to leave my editor and can work more distraction-free! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/v1JAI08Dw88"&gt;Check out this video&lt;/a&gt; to see how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-wallabyjs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WallabyJs.wallaby-vscode"&gt;Wallaby.js&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wallaby.js is from the same creators as Quokka.js. Wallaby.js is a developer productivity tool that runs your JavaScript and TypeScript tests immediately as you type, highlighting results in your IDE right next to your code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jxD1BbRS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kafw3qqigibp4u56twd8.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jxD1BbRS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kafw3qqigibp4u56twd8.gif" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a valuable extension that shows you live results when coding your unit tests. I find it very helpful to see the output and debug tests in real-time. As you can see, Wallaby.js is similar to Quokka.js using the same inline reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#7-gitlive-for-better-team-coordination"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  7. &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamHub.teamhub"&gt;GitLive for Better Team Coordination&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remote work has become the standard in many software organizations. Therefore, communication between developers has become more critical than ever before. The GitLive extension takes away some of the communication burden remote teams experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With GitLive, you can connect to your team members to see which repositories, branches, or files they are working on. Moreover, you can connect your issue tracking software to GitLive to share which ticket you’re focusing on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a great tool for remote development teams to see who’s working on what and avoid merge conflicts. For instance, if you are working on the same file for different branches or features, you can detect this with GitLive. In summary, the extension prevents merge conflicts before they occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JpL8AvdI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u7q3tq0cvk65xj0vh79r.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JpL8AvdI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u7q3tq0cvk65xj0vh79r.gif" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main concern for developers to improve their productivity is removing distractions from their day-to-day activities. &lt;br&gt;
StackFinder is a fun and valuable extension to stay focused. Opening a web browser can trigger multiple pop-up notifications that distract you. Even StackOverflow can be a source of distraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, a team’s efficiency depends on how well they communicate. Thus, an extension like Stepsize and GitLive are useful to improve communication.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When learning CS, there are some useful sites you must know to get always informed to do your technologies even better and learn new things. Here are some tools you should have under your belt (or at least know about), even if you might’ve never heard of them! They could save you later on...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just check them out...&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Let's optimize JavaScript - password generator (2.15x faster)</title>
      <author>Keff</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 09:46:27 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/nombrekeff/i-created-one-of-the-fastests-node-js-password-generators-without-knowing-16ll</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/nombrekeff/i-created-one-of-the-fastests-node-js-password-generators-without-knowing-16ll</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was searching through Github explore, when I found a password generator (&lt;a href="https://github.com/omgovich/omgopass"&gt;omgopass&lt;/a&gt;), that supposedly was quite a lot faster that other alternatives. 600 times faster than &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/password-generator"&gt;&lt;code&gt;password-generator&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#this-is-the-benchmark-raw-omgopass-endraw-shows"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  This is the benchmark &lt;code&gt;omgopass&lt;/code&gt; shows:
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--J1J-A8TT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/alwpeyf073o5i4rnirlo.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--J1J-A8TT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/alwpeyf073o5i4rnirlo.png" alt="Original omgopass Benchmark"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After seeing this I remembered I did a password generator a couple weeks back, and did not perform any benchmarks, so I decided to test my approach with this other libraries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my surprise it did fairly well, scoring second place in the same benchmark as shown above. Quite good for not even trying. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#%C2%A0benchmark-with-my-pass-generator-raw-passgenny-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
   Benchmark with my pass generator (&lt;a href="https://github.com/nombrekeff/pass-genny"&gt;&lt;code&gt;passGenny&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;):
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0VYQ1EOM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sjhq73acnomolt1lrgm6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0VYQ1EOM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sjhq73acnomolt1lrgm6.png" alt="Benchmark with passGenny"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#considerations"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Considerations
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This benchmark is not a reflection of the quality of the library or the skills of the developers, to really be sure a load more tests and benchmarks should be done. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, features vary from one library to the other, ones are readable, ones are not. Some use crypto for random, some not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that being said,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#%C2%A0lets-make-passgenny-faster"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
   Let's make &lt;strong&gt;passGenny&lt;/strong&gt; faster
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to give it a go, and try optimizing it, let's see the original code:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

            &lt;span class="na"&gt;readable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;updateOptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;newOptions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;newOptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;min&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;max&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;floor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;max&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;min&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;min&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;_getCharactersForOptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;combinedCaracters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[];&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;lowercase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;combinedCaracters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;PasswordGenerator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;lowerCaseChars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;uppercase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;combinedCaracters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;PasswordGenerator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;upperCaseChars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;symbols&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;combinedCaracters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;PasswordGenerator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;symbolsChars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;numbers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;combinedCaracters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;PasswordGenerator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;numbersString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;combinedCaracters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;generate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;combinedCaracters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_getCharactersForOptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;combinedCaracters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;combinedCaracters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)];&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What this class does is, from a set of options, it will generate passwords. It does this by combining all characters allowed (by the options) into a single array, then we iterate over the length of the password (defined by options), and get a random character from that array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple enough right? Now, I think we could optimize this quite a bit, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#optimization-1"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Optimization 1
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, the first thing I noticed is, in &lt;code&gt;_getCharactersForOptions&lt;/code&gt;, I'm using arrays to hold the valid characters. Using the spread operator to append them into the &lt;code&gt;combinedCaracters&lt;/code&gt; array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is kinda redundant as we could be using string all the way through. And concatenating a string is way cheaper that combining arrays. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lets-see-what-we-could-change"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Let's see what we could change.
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we need to change how we store the characters, we don't need to split them:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PasswordGenerator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;upperCaseChars&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;lowerCaseChars&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;symbolsChars&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;[]{}=?()&amp;amp;%$#@!¡?¿*_-.:;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;numbersString&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;0123456789&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ... more code&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Great, now let's modify the &lt;code&gt;_getCharactersForOptions&lt;/code&gt; method:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PasswordGenerator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;_getCharactersForOptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;combinedCaracters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;lowercase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;combinedCaracters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PasswordGeneratorFast1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;lowerCaseChars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;uppercase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;combinedCaracters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PasswordGeneratorFast1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;upperCaseChars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;symbols&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;combinedCaracters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PasswordGeneratorFast1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;symbolsChars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;numbers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;combinedCaracters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PasswordGeneratorFast1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;numbersString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;combinedCaracters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notice how we now return a string, instead of an array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lets-see-how-this-does-in-the-benchmark"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Let's see how this does in the benchmark
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q28JkC8X--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2feork2avqgekuk9t9gm.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q28JkC8X--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2feork2avqgekuk9t9gm.png" alt="Benchmark with passGenny with one level of optimization"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Damn, I did not expect that big of a change, it almost doubled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, in this particular case, strings perform a lot better than arrays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#but-wait"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  BUT WAIT
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I can optimize this even more, you might have noticed, that the result of &lt;code&gt;_getCharactersForOptions&lt;/code&gt; will always be the same with the same options. Meaning we don't need to concatenate the string on each password, we only need to generate them if the options change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could approach this in a couple of ways, using memoization (possibly better), creating a proxy around the object or the simple approach I will show you next. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#optimization-2"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Optimization 2
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I will do is, make options private and force people to change options using &lt;code&gt;updateOptions&lt;/code&gt; method. This will allow me to mark if options have changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's see the complete example, and I will break it down afterwards:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PasswordGeneratorFast2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;upperCaseChars&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;lowerCaseChars&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;symbolsChars&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;[]{}=?()&amp;amp;%$#@!¡?¿*_-.:;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;numbersString&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;0123456789&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;randomFn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_options&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;uppercase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;lowercase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;symbols&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;numbers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;readable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_random&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;randomFn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mathRandom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_combinedCharacters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_optionsChanged&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_getCharactersForOptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;updateOptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;newOptions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_options&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;newOptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_optionsChanged&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;generate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;combinedCaracters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_getCharactersForOptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;combinedCaracters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;combinedCaracters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;_getCharactersForOptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// If options have not changed, we can return the previoulsy combined characters&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_optionsChanged&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_combinedCharacters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;combinedCaracters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;lowercase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;combinedCaracters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PasswordGeneratorFast1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;lowerCaseChars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;uppercase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;combinedCaracters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PasswordGeneratorFast1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;upperCaseChars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;symbols&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;combinedCaracters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PasswordGeneratorFast1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;symbolsChars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;numbers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;combinedCaracters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PasswordGeneratorFast1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;numbersString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Update and mark options as not changed&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_combinedCharacters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;combinedCaracters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_optionsChanged&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_combinedCharacters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We add &lt;code&gt;_optionsChanged&lt;/code&gt;, indicates whether the options have changed since the last time &lt;code&gt;_getCharactersForOptions&lt;/code&gt; was called.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We store the last combined character in &lt;code&gt;_combinedCharacters&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We modify &lt;code&gt;_getCharactersForOptions&lt;/code&gt;, so that if options have not changed, we return the last generated &lt;code&gt;_combinedCharacters&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We change &lt;code&gt;password +=&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;password.concat()&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;em&gt;in my tests, it concat performed better that +=&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it, let's see how that did:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9nV9HI31--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q9qhk7dagak8fs9724qt.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9nV9HI31--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q9qhk7dagak8fs9724qt.png" alt="Benchmark with passGenny with two levels of optimization"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Impressive if you ask me, we made &lt;strong&gt;passGenny&lt;/strong&gt; more that twice as fast, scoring first by quite a bit of margin. If we phrase it as &lt;strong&gt;omgovich&lt;/strong&gt; did, &lt;code&gt;passGenny&lt;/code&gt; is 2,444 times faster than &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/password-generator"&gt;password-generator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-to-take-from-this"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What to take from this?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keeping it simple can equate to performant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't use arrays if you don't need to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check if operations are needed to be performed every time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you need performance, sometimes the smaller things make the biggest difference&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PD: I'm no performance expert, so I might be missing some important thing, please let me know If I missed something or I misinterpreted the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a great day!&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/avneesh0612/how-to-add-a-license-to-a-github-repository-in-less-than-2-minutes-3mg4</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should add a license to your open-source projects for making it easier for people to contribute and many hackathons like the ones organized by Hashnode need a license.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#adding-the-license"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Adding the license
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go to the repository you want to add the license to and click on Add file&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--O1sePeVq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1629966602935/bLSSSPG0Y.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--O1sePeVq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1629966602935/bLSSSPG0Y.png" alt="image.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now click on Create new file. You will be directed to a page like this&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--k6sOsXE8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1629966899567/te7BPbLGo.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--k6sOsXE8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1629966899567/te7BPbLGo.png" alt="image.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type License as the name of the file and you should see Choose a license template button in the left corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YM1TK2Nf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1629966978377/hzJq8_wyE.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YM1TK2Nf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1629966978377/hzJq8_wyE.png" alt="image.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now choose any License you need from the options given.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--r9s23bOG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1629967110027/GDlMTFHZe.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--r9s23bOG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1629967110027/GDlMTFHZe.png" alt="image.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT is one of the most famous licenses, So I am gonna choose that&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can add the two details you are asked for there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3RhDCOSB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1629967236301/MkJqdtXTk.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3RhDCOSB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1629967236301/MkJqdtXTk.png" alt="image.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can either create a new branch and commit the file but I am going to commit it directly to the main branch for simplicity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--a5mq2dRD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1629967358126/BQrBSLlHk.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--a5mq2dRD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1629967358126/BQrBSLlHk.png" alt="image.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have added a license to your repository 🎉.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--r0Y7LDFd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1629967422477/VknqHbxp7.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--r0Y7LDFd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1629967422477/VknqHbxp7.gif" alt="YayCongratsGIF.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can add it to your Readme as well. Here is a sample of how it is added in many repositories -&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;## 📝 License

      <title>Type Narrowing in TypeScript</title>
      <author>Maina Wycliffe</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 09:41:32 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/this-is-learning/type-narrowing-in-typescript-3bdp</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/this-is-learning/type-narrowing-in-typescript-3bdp</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of my last few articles, where we have looked into &lt;a href="https://mainawycliffe.dev/blog/template-literal-types-in-typescript"&gt;Template Literal Types&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://mainawycliffe.dev/blog/types-and-mocking-typescript"&gt;Types and Mocking&lt;/a&gt;, we are going to dissect another topic in typescript involving types. In this article, we are going to learn various ways you can narrow types. Type narrowing is the process of moving a type from a less precise type to a more precise type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start with a simple function:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;friends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// code here&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The above function can either take a number or a string. Let's say we want to perform different actions based upon whether &lt;code&gt;input&lt;/code&gt; is a number or a string. In this case, we will use Javascripts type guards to check if it's a string or number, as shown below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;someFunc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// do something with the string&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;input is a string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// do something with number&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;input is a number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#type-guards"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Type Guards
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above example, we used Javascripts type guards to narrow the type of &lt;code&gt;input&lt;/code&gt; to either number or string. Type guards are used to check if a variable is of a certain type, i.e. &lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt;, etc. When a type guard is used, Typescript expects that variable to be of that type. It will automatically type check its usage based on that information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of Javascripts type guards available: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#string"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  string
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;param&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// do something with string value&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#number"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  number
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;param&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// do something with number value&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#bigint"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  bigint
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;param&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;bigint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// do something with bigint value&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#boolean"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  boolean
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;param&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// do something with boolean value&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#symbol"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  symbol
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;param&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;symbol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// do something with symbol value&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#undefined"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  undefined
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;param&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// do something with undefined value&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#object"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  object
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;if(typeof param === "object") {
  // do something with object value
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#function"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  function
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;param&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// do something with the function&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#truthiness-narrowing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Truthiness Narrowing
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this type of narrowing, we check whether a variable is &lt;strong&gt;truthy&lt;/strong&gt; before using it. When a variable is truthy, typescript will automatically remove the possibility of that variable being &lt;strong&gt;falsy&lt;/strong&gt; i.e. &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;, etc, within the conditional check. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take for instance the following example, where a function &lt;strong&gt;someFunction&lt;/strong&gt; below takes an &lt;code&gt;input&lt;/code&gt;, whose type is either a string or undefined (i.e. optional).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;someFunction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// "string"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By checking whether &lt;code&gt;input&lt;/code&gt; *&lt;strong&gt;*is truthy, the type of **x&lt;/strong&gt; becomes a string otherwise it's &lt;strong&gt;undefined&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#equality-narrowing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Equality Narrowing
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If two variables are equal, then the types of both variables must be the same. If one variable is of an imprecise type (i.e. &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; etc.) and is equal to another variable of a precise type, then typescript will use that information to narrow the type of the first variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the following function, which takes two parameters: &lt;strong&gt;x&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;y&lt;/strong&gt;, with &lt;strong&gt;x&lt;/strong&gt; being either a &lt;strong&gt;string&lt;/strong&gt; or a &lt;strong&gt;number&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;y&lt;/strong&gt; being a &lt;strong&gt;number&lt;/strong&gt;. When the value of &lt;strong&gt;x&lt;/strong&gt; is equal to the value of &lt;strong&gt;y&lt;/strong&gt;, then the type of &lt;strong&gt;x&lt;/strong&gt; is inferred to be a &lt;strong&gt;number&lt;/strong&gt; and otherwise a &lt;strong&gt;string&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;someFunction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// narrowed to number&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// number&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// this is not narrowed&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// number or string&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#discriminated-unions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Discriminated Unions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this approach, you create an object, with a literal member that can be used to discriminate between two different unions. Let's take an example of a function that calculates the square of different shapes - Rectangle and Circle. We will start by defining the type of Rectangle and Circle.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Rectangle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;reactangle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Circle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;circle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From the above types, the objects will each have the literal field of shape, which can either be a &lt;code&gt;circle&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;rectangle&lt;/code&gt;. We can use the shape field within our function to calculate area, that would accept a union of &lt;code&gt;Rectangle&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Circle&lt;/code&gt;, as shown below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;calculateArea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Rectangle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Circle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;reactangle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// you can only access the properties of reactangle and not circle&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Area of reactangle: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;circle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// you can only access the properties of circle and not reactangle&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Area of circle: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;3.14&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;radius&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the &lt;code&gt;shape&lt;/code&gt; field is a rectangle, you only have access to properties available in the &lt;code&gt;Rectangle&lt;/code&gt; type, that is &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;shape&lt;/code&gt;. The same applies to when &lt;code&gt;shape&lt;/code&gt; field is a circle, typescript will only allow you to access &lt;code&gt;radius&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;circle&lt;/code&gt; and will throw an error otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/type-narrowing-jswcw?view=editor"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#using-the-in-operator-for-narrowing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Using the in Operator for Narrowing
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; operator is used to determine if an object has a property with a name in it. It's used in the format of &lt;code&gt;"property" in object&lt;/code&gt; where &lt;code&gt;property&lt;/code&gt; is the name of the property you want to check if it exists inside the &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the example above, we used discriminated unions to distinguish between a Circle and Rectangle. We can also use the &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; operator to achieve the same, but this time we will be checking if a shape contains certain properties i.e. &lt;code&gt;radius&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;Circle&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;Rectangle&lt;/code&gt;, and the results would be the same.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Circle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Reactangle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;calculateArea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Circle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Reactangle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// now you can access radius from shape&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Area of circle: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;3.14&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;radius&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// any attempt to access height or width will result to an error&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Property 'width' does not exist on type 'Circle'.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Error: Property 'height' does not exist on type 'Circle'&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// now you can access height and width from the shape object&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Area of reactangle: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// any attempt to access raidus would result to an error&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Error: Property 'radius' does not exist on type 'Reactangle'.ts&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#using-assignment-narrowing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Using Assignment Narrowing
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this type of narrowing, typescript will narrow the type of a variable once it's assigned a value. Take a variable x of union type of either &lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;, if we assign it a &lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt;, the type becomes a &lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt; and if we assign it a &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;, the type changes to a string instead.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// "number"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;something&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// "string"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here is a detailed example at Code Sandbox:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/type-narrowing-jswcw?module=assignmentNarrowing.ts&amp;amp;view=editor"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#using-instanceof-for-narrowing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Using instanceof for Narrowing
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Javascripts' &lt;code&gt;instanceof&lt;/code&gt; operator is used to check if a value is an instance of a certain class. It's used in the format of &lt;code&gt;value instanceof value2&lt;/code&gt; and returns a boolean. When you check if a value is an &lt;code&gt;instanceof&lt;/code&gt; a class, Typescript will assign that type to the variable, thereby narrowing the type. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the following example, where a function takes in a date, which can be either a string or a Date. If it's a Date, we want to convert it to a string and if it's a string, we will return it as is. We can use instanceof to check if it's an instance of a Date and convert it to string, as shown below.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dateToString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;instanceof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// The type now is Date and you can access Date methods&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toISOString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we learned various ways we can narrow types, from type guards to discriminated unions. In our next article, we will learn how we can build our own type guards using type predicates.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the advancements made in the field of modern day machine-learning technologies, it has become quite easy and flexible to develop models and applications based on this domain. So, you might have a perception that the realm of Machine Learning requires complex algorithms and huge expert knowledge for it's projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in the recent times, it has been quite easy to develop them as most of the standard algorithms and models are made available on the Internet in the form of web-applications. In this project, we will be using &lt;strong&gt;Teachable Machine&lt;/strong&gt;, along with &lt;strong&gt;Tensorflow.js&lt;/strong&gt; to control the basic actions in &lt;strong&gt;Google Meet&lt;/strong&gt; such as muting, switching off your video and a special action, which will be revealed in the later course of the article.         &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teachable Machine&lt;/strong&gt; is an online web-application, created by &lt;strong&gt;Google Creative Labs&lt;/strong&gt; that facilitates &lt;strong&gt;easy and fast creation of machine learning models&lt;/strong&gt; that is accessible to everyone on the net. It is flexible as it makes use of &lt;strong&gt;pre-existing files&lt;/strong&gt; or even &lt;strong&gt;capture live examples&lt;/strong&gt;, which will be recorded as instances, on the basis of which references will be made. You can even make a choice to use your models entirely &lt;strong&gt;on-device&lt;/strong&gt;, without any webcam or microphone data being conveyed outside your system. &lt;br&gt;
The advantage is that you train your computer to recognize your &lt;strong&gt;images, sounds, and poses&lt;/strong&gt; of your personal choice, without writing any complicated and long machine learning code. Then, you can use your model in your own &lt;strong&gt;projects, applications, websites and even more&lt;/strong&gt;. It is powered by &lt;strong&gt;Tensorflow.js&lt;/strong&gt;, which is an open-source library, created by &lt;strong&gt;Google&lt;/strong&gt; for the purpose of Machine-Learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prerequisites"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Prerequisites
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, at the most, what you require is the basic knowledge of &lt;strong&gt;Vanilla JavaScript&lt;/strong&gt;, a webcam, an Internet connection and the passion to learn something new. Then, follow the below steps and get your own functional model developed in front of your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-project"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Project
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project is in the form of a chrome browser-extension, which basically controls all the actions on Google Meet. The article has been divided into the following subtopics to facilitate your understanding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-1-training-your-model"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 1: Training your Model
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step involves &lt;strong&gt;creating the basic models on Teachable Machine&lt;/strong&gt;. The model can be either any &lt;strong&gt;image, body pose or sound of your choice&lt;/strong&gt;. In this project, we have decided to utilize the &lt;strong&gt;basic image model&lt;/strong&gt; for training our computer. However, you can also use body poses and speech to train your model otherwise. &lt;strong&gt;Make sure the images, poses or sounds that you wish to implement are quite unnatural and can be performed accurately.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, to start with, head over to the &lt;a href="https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/"&gt;Teachable Machine&lt;/a&gt; site and click on &lt;strong&gt;Get Started&lt;/strong&gt;. You can further access it from the hamburger  menu at the top-left corner of the homepage. You will get the following page:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gAQiRh7j--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lmg5sbegmoeim8odk30r.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gAQiRh7j--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lmg5sbegmoeim8odk30r.png" alt="Screenshot_2021-08-07_15-45-06"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will now get the options for creating your model online to train your machine. There are three different projects namely &lt;strong&gt;Image Project, Audio Project and Pose Project&lt;/strong&gt;. For our model, we have used the &lt;strong&gt;Pose Project&lt;/strong&gt; for it's implementation. You can also import your previously saved models from your &lt;strong&gt;Google Drive or local file system&lt;/strong&gt; if you want to use a model which was created beforehand and you wish to reuse and modify it. If you want a new model, just click on &lt;strong&gt;Pose Project&lt;/strong&gt;. Then, the site will redirect you to your project destination: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9MJfnRaO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/m6vljtdzwbz6neq7l2gk.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9MJfnRaO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/m6vljtdzwbz6neq7l2gk.png" alt="abc"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you have to record your images in the form of &lt;strong&gt;"classes"&lt;/strong&gt;. The images can be &lt;strong&gt;captured live via webcam&lt;/strong&gt;, or can be &lt;strong&gt;uploaded from the local file system&lt;/strong&gt; as well. The image samples of a particular class should be &lt;strong&gt;same and repetitive&lt;/strong&gt; in nature, while the image samples used in various classes should be &lt;strong&gt;different&lt;/strong&gt; so that the class can be defined more accurately and can be recognized with ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is advisable to record &lt;strong&gt;at least 50 to 60 images&lt;/strong&gt; for increasing the accuracy threshold of the recorded class. In order to record live instances, grant permission to your webcam and press the &lt;strong&gt;Hold to Record&lt;/strong&gt; button to capture your live images. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want a free tutorial on how to record your model in the form of images, you can head over to the &lt;a href="https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/v1/"&gt;Teachable Machine Tutorial&lt;/a&gt; and click on &lt;strong&gt;"Let's Go"&lt;/strong&gt; for a live demo practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can change the &lt;strong&gt;labels&lt;/strong&gt; of the classes according to your wish. In this project, we have made use of three classes namely: &lt;strong&gt;Audio&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt;Video&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Escape&lt;/strong&gt;, which are recorded live via webcam. The images in these classes can be specific &lt;strong&gt;hand gestures ,facial expressions or particular objects&lt;/strong&gt;, which can be identified and recognized by the machine easily. &lt;br&gt;
In order to add more than two classes, click on &lt;strong&gt;Add Class&lt;/strong&gt;. After recording the image samples for the respective classes, it is time to train and export your model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-2-exporting-your-model"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 2: Exporting your Model
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uQlW42CH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hzl31obq3b7r3grmk5no.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uQlW42CH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hzl31obq3b7r3grmk5no.png" alt="Screenshot_2021-08-07_16-59-46"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After, you have created your respective classes, click on &lt;strong&gt;Train Model&lt;/strong&gt;, which will train your machine to recognize the content of the images, which will be used in our upcoming projects. Teachable Machine mainly uses &lt;strong&gt;pattern recognition algorithms&lt;/strong&gt; and involves the usage of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Statistical Techniques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Structural Techniques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Template Matching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neural Network Approach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fuzzy Model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hybrid Models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After your model has been trained, you can &lt;strong&gt;preview your model&lt;/strong&gt; before exporting it. This helps you to test the model before implementing it in your projects. Just perform the poses according to the images set by you and check whether the machine can identify them or not. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--83wZS8Pe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1oo8kbt57ew1xsxkehb6.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--83wZS8Pe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1oo8kbt57ew1xsxkehb6.gif" alt="ezgif.com-gif-maker"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When your model has been prepared, click on &lt;strong&gt;Export Model&lt;/strong&gt; and export the model in the form of &lt;strong&gt;Tensorflow.js&lt;/strong&gt;. Click on &lt;strong&gt;Upload my model&lt;/strong&gt;, which will publish your model online and it will generate an &lt;strong&gt;URL&lt;/strong&gt; , where your model will be hosted by Teachable Machine for free. You can also download it in the form of &lt;strong&gt;Tensorflow&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Tensorflow Lite&lt;/strong&gt; for local uses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The model used in the project is live at:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/models/fDdI9WGhO/"&gt;Project Model&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-3-preparing-the-manifestjson"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 3: Preparing the Manifest.json
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step involves creating a &lt;strong&gt;Chrome browser extension&lt;/strong&gt; to render the following model to the Google Meet URL. So, we have to create the &lt;strong&gt;manifest.json&lt;/strong&gt; file in the browser directory which will be loaded in the browser. So let's have a look at the json file:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Gmeet_Controller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;An extension to control Google Meet Actions using hand/facial gestures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;permissions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;activeTab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;storage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;tabs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;notifications&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;manifest_version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;content_scripts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;matches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;https://meet.google.com/*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;src/tf.min.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;src/teachablemachine-pose.min.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;src/background.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can set the &lt;strong&gt;name&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;description&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;version&lt;/strong&gt; according to your choice, which is basically the information which will be displayed when you will load the extension on to the browser. You can also store &lt;strong&gt;icons&lt;/strong&gt; in a separate directory in your extension directory and render them on to the browser. The URL needs to be specified in &lt;strong&gt;"matches"&lt;/strong&gt; under &lt;strong&gt;content scripts&lt;/strong&gt;. You can set &lt;strong&gt;permissions&lt;/strong&gt; as well, if you do not want the extension to have unnecessary access to your system storage, notifications etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-4-linking-your-models-to-google-meet"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 4: Linking your models to Google Meet
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now create a separate directory to store the javascript files (here &lt;strong&gt;src&lt;/strong&gt;), which will render the functionality of the extension. Download the latest and updated version of &lt;a href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs/dist/tf.min.js"&gt;tf.min.js&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@teachablemachine/pose@0.8.3/dist/teachablemachine-pose.min.js"&gt;teachablemachine-pose.min.js&lt;/a&gt;, and place them in the directory. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: This project can also be accomplished using npm and yarn packages such as "@teachablemachine/pose" and "@tensorflow/tfjs" or using their CDNs. However, we have used Vanilla JS to make the project simple and beginner-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After importing, it is now time to frame the &lt;strong&gt;background.js&lt;/strong&gt;. First, declare a constant variable named URL which will contain the model URL that was generated by Teachable Machine.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/models/&amp;lt;MODEL_ID&amp;gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Use your own personalized model here&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then you have to write the basic Javascript to adjust the frame &lt;strong&gt;height and width&lt;/strong&gt; of the webcam, &lt;strong&gt;request access from the webcam&lt;/strong&gt; and keep on &lt;strong&gt;updating the webcam frame&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;webcam&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ctx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;labelContainer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;maxPredictions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;modelURL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;model.json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;metadataURL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;metadata.json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;tmPose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;modelURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;metadataURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;maxPredictions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getTotalClasses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;flip&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;webcam&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;tmPose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Webcam&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;flip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;webcam&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;webcam&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;play&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;requestAnimationFrame&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;loop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;webcam-container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;webcam&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;canvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;loop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;timestamp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;webcam&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;predict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;requestAnimationFrame&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;loop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now we have to write the functions to identify the event on the webcam, compare it with the classes of the models and if the event's probability is more than the threshold probability then the function gets executed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Audio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;probability&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;probability&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;audioButton&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelectorAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.VfPpkd-Bz112c-LgbsSe.yHy1rc.eT1oJ.tWDL4c.uaILN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;audioButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;classList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;contains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;HNeRed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;audioButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Video&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;probability&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;probability&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Open &lt;strong&gt;Google Chrome&lt;/strong&gt;, and type &lt;strong&gt;"chrome://extensions"&lt;/strong&gt;, to navigate to the &lt;strong&gt;Extensions&lt;/strong&gt; window. Now toggle on the &lt;strong&gt;Developer mode&lt;/strong&gt;, and click on &lt;strong&gt;Load unpacked&lt;/strong&gt;. Then open the file directory where your &lt;strong&gt;manifest.json&lt;/strong&gt; is stored. The extension is now ready to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now you can have your own personalized model working on your system!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A hands-on introduction to deep reinforcement learning using Unity ML-Agents</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⚠ Note: this series is still a work in progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#purpose"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Purpose
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of great reinforcement learning (RL) courses out there. Just to name a few:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://deepmind.com/learning-resources/-introduction-reinforcement-learning-david-silver"&gt;Introduction to Reinforcement Learning by David Silver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/"&gt;Spinning Up by OpenAI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning"&gt;Reinforcement Learning Specialization by University of Alberta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you're anything like me, you might prefer a 'learning by doing' approach. With hands-on experience upfront, it may be easier for you to grasp the theory and math behind the algorithms later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this series, I'll walk you through how to use &lt;a href="https://unity.com/products/machine-learning-agents"&gt;Unity ML-Agents&lt;/a&gt; to build a volleyball environment and train agents to play in it using deep RL. For a bit of fun and extra incentive, you'll be able to submit your trained agent to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/CoderOneHQ/ultimate-volleyball"&gt;Ultimate Volleyball leaderboard&lt;/a&gt; and have it compete against other agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--52lWUlSw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lr2zmstgz4f1ppihy8g5.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--52lWUlSw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lr2zmstgz4f1ppihy8g5.gif" alt="Ultimate Volleyball"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-mlagents"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why ML-Agents?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ML-Agents is an add-on for Unity (a game development platform). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It lets us design a complex physics-rich environment without needing to build any of the physics simulation logic ourselves. It also lets us experiment with state-of-the-art RL algorithms without having to set up any boilerplate code or install additional libraries. The nice graphics and interface are a plus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-very-brief-overview-of-reinforcement-learning"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A (very brief) overview of reinforcement learning
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, think about how you might teach a dog a new trick, like telling it to sit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it performs the trick correctly (it sits), you’ll &lt;strong&gt;reward&lt;/strong&gt; it with a treat (&lt;em&gt;positive feedback&lt;/em&gt;) ✔️&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it doesn’t sit correctly, it doesn’t get a treat (&lt;em&gt;negative feedback&lt;/em&gt;) ❌&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By continuing to do things that lead to positive outcomes, the dog will learn to sit when it hears the command in order to get its treat. Reinforcement learning is a subdomain of machine learning which involves training an ‘&lt;strong&gt;agent&lt;/strong&gt;’ (&lt;em&gt;the dog&lt;/em&gt;) to learn the correct sequences of &lt;strong&gt;actions&lt;/strong&gt; to take (&lt;em&gt;sitting&lt;/em&gt;) on its &lt;strong&gt;environment&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;in response to the command ‘sit’&lt;/em&gt;) in order to maximize its &lt;strong&gt;reward&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;getting a treat&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be illustrated more formally as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--okObq8DS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x1zs6o1jtkn5ccfxgnwr.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--okObq8DS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x1zs6o1jtkn5ccfxgnwr.png" alt="Sutton and Barto"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
