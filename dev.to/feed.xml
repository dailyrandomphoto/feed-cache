      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article, we are going to take a look at the Platform Module from Angular CDK. The platform module provides you with information about the current platform where your web app is running on, such as OS, Browser, Rendering Engine, etc. It also gives you information on the features the platform supports such as scroll behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This enables you to identify the platform where your app is running on and modify the behavior of your Angular app appropriately. The CDK Platform Module makes the following information available to you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is Android - Whether the OS is Android&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is iOS - Whether the OS is iOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is Firefox - Whether the browser is Firefox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is Edge - Whether the browser is Edge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is Safari - Whether the browser is Safari&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is Blink - Whether the rendering engine is Blink&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is Webkit - Whether the rendering engine is WebKit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is Trident - Whether the rendering engine is &lt;a href="https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Trident_(software)"&gt;Trident&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supported Input Types - A list of input form field types supported by the browser i.e. number, password, radio, range, reset, search, submit, tel, text, time, url, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether the browsers supports &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-behavior"&gt;Scroll Behavior&lt;/a&gt; -&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And Whether the browser supports &lt;a href="https://web.dev/uses-passive-event-listeners/"&gt;passive event listeners&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installation" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installation
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using yarn:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;yarn add @angular/cdk
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Install @angular/cdk using yarn&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using NPM:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;npm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; @angular/cdk
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Install @angular/cdk using npm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#usage" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Usage
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we will need to import the &lt;code&gt;PlatformModule&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;@angular/cdk/platform&lt;/code&gt; inside our app module, as shown below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// other imports&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PlatformModule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@angular/cdk/platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;NgModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;declarations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AppComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ... components&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;imports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ... other modules&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PlatformModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;providers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;bootstrap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;AppComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AppModule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NB:&lt;/strong&gt; If you are using feature or shared modules, you will need to import &lt;code&gt;PlatformModule&lt;/code&gt; inside the module where the component using it is located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, we are going to inject the &lt;code&gt;Platform&lt;/code&gt; service into the component where we want to use the platform information.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Platform&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@angular/cdk/platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ... other imports&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ... component metadata&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And finally, we can determine the browser platform information as shown below.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ANDROID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// check if OS is android&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;FIREFOX&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// check if Browser is Firefox&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;IOS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// check if OS is iOS&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;BLINK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// check if render engine is Blink&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isBrowser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// check if the app is being rendered on the browser&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For an up-to-date reference for the API, please refer to the official docs &lt;a href="https://material.angular.io/cdk/platform/api"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#example" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Example
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to implement a share functionality for our web app, where on mobile devices i.e. iOS and Android, we will use native share while on Desktop, we will use share buttons for each Social Media Platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will use the &lt;code&gt;PlatformModule&lt;/code&gt; to determine if the user is on &lt;code&gt;iOS&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Android&lt;/code&gt;, and then we will use the &lt;a href="https://web.dev/web-share/"&gt;WebShare API&lt;/a&gt;. For other devices i.e. Desktop, we will just show a simple twitter share button instead. Here is what our component looks like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Platform&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@angular/cdk/platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;app-social-share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;templateUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;./social-share.component.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;styleUrls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;./social-share.component.scss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;SocialShareComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;OnInit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;shareUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hashtags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;tweetShareUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;isNativeShareSupported&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ngOnInit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// show native share if on Android and IOS and if it is supported&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isNativeShareSupported&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nb"&gt;navigator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;share&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ANDROID&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;IOS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;baseUrl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;tweetShareUrl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;baseUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;?url=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shareUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;amp;via=mwycliffe_dev&amp;amp;text=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;amp;hashtags=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hashtags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nativeShare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;navigator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;navigator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;substr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shareUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our share component above, has a property named &lt;code&gt;isNativeShareSupported&lt;/code&gt; - which is a &lt;code&gt;boolean&lt;/code&gt;. We are checking whether the current browser supports native share, and the platform is iOS or Android before setting that property to true. And then we can use this property to show the correct UI, as shown below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;ng-container&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;*ngIf=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"isNativeShareSupported; else showSocialShareButton"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;(click)=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"nativeShare()"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"space-x-2"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Share this article&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/ng-container&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;ng-template&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;#showSocialShareButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  Share on this article: &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;target=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"_blank"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;[href]=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"tweetShareUrl"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Twitter&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/ng-template&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we have learned how to use CDK &lt;code&gt;Platform Module&lt;/code&gt; to check the platform details in which our app is running on. This is a simple and quite useful way of modifying the behavior of your Angular app based on the platform being used. This can lead to an improved UX as you can enable enhanced features to users with access to them while providing a decent fallback to users without access to the enhanced features.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wow! Today is International Women's Day. I am glad that this day officially exist to give value and honor to all the women in the world who are making great difference. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like count myself in for making a difference and also to my mother who is not with me in this world today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#about-me-" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  About Me :)
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name &lt;a href="https://jonahandersson.tech/"&gt;Jonah Andersson&lt;/a&gt; is a Filipina-Swedish Software Developer at Forefront Consulting, Sweden. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I studied Computer Science, Agile System Development i C# .NET, and Programming in Java. I had a childhood dream of being an architect or civil engineer but due to life circumstances, I  ended up studying about the science of computers and programming and she didn’t regret that! In fact, I enjoys being a programmer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoys solving challenging complex problems, coding back-end and has great interest in developing applications full-stack in C# .NET using new technologies such as Microsoft Azure. From time to time, I shares my technical knowledge at some virtual conferences and user groups on my spare time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to teach programming to kids in schools and saw the gender inequality problem there. I volunteer to mentor and to help make a difference by inspiring tech to young women. I like to connect with other developers, share my technical skills with others, and personally helping out with gender diversity and inclusion in my workplace. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9Q5cfBMB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8r5arigvq7xg7qeb5f9o.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9Q5cfBMB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8r5arigvq7xg7qeb5f9o.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="#my-inspiring-story-to-tech-and-software-engineering" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My Inspiring Story To Tech and Software Engineering
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My journey to starting a career to the tech industry is a long, challenging and inspiring story. It all started in the Philippines where I grew up. When I was a young girl, I got to watch a story about the amazon women, back then when I was a kid, they were used to be known to be fierce female warriors. Different, strong and brave. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was growing up, I wanted to be different and strong like the amazon women I’ve been on TV. However, I was not as brave when I was a young girl. I was shy and was scared to be in the crowd. My mother used to encourage me to face that fear. My choice of dream job and education were influenced by my dreams and what I wanted myself to be - to be different, brave, and strong. That somehow influenced me. I had a dream to become a civil engineer, which was back then known to be a men-dominated job wherever you are. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That dream job didn’t happen because of life circumstances and economic reasons. In the Philippines, getting a good degree in a good college or a university is not free. We don’t have that privilege of free university education. However, we have scholarship programs supported by private organizations or the government. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my parents could not afford to send me to college and take the civil engineering degree that I dreamed of, I took the initiative of taking a government scholarship that was offered in my high school back then. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really want to go to the university and chase my dreams. So, when I was finishing high school, I took a scholarship exam offered. I took the scholarship exam, I passed it and I did it. I got the scholarship!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I did not not have the option to study civil engineering in my scholarship program, but I was really glad. I had the opportunity to study Computer Science at a private college Asian College of Science and Technology in the Philippines. I studied a degree in Computer Science as a scholar and graduated in 2004. It was also the toughest year in my life when my mother (also my best-friend mom) died of breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just turned 18 years old then. When my mother died, as the eldest child in the family, I was forced to take the responsibility of being the breadwinner of the family. Instead of finding a job within the programming field, I took the first job as technical support that I could have back then to earn a living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I moved from the Philippines to Sweden 9 years ago, I decided to pursue my passion and dream to work with software engineering. I studied more about software development in programming languages C# and Java for another 3 years until I got my first job as a full stack software developer in Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;

  Volunteering - Mentorship and Being A Role-Model To Fix Gender Diversity Problem
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last December 2020, I was invited to speaking at Virtual Azure Community Day. One of the topics I proposed talking was about Gender Inequality Problem in Tech. In that talk, I presented to the public the list of reasons, what I think we should do and what I am doing myself to fix it. You can watch my talk about it on &lt;a href="https://azureday.community/english-december-2020/gender-equality-in-tech-why-is-it-a-problem-and-how-can-we-fix-it/"&gt;Gender Inequality in Tech - Why Is it a problem and How can we fix it?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  The things I've learned working as a woman in tech and working in software engineering field
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I am a programmer who is expected to think logically, I am also a deep thinker and a reflective person. I have learned a lot in life and through the years so far working as a woman in tech. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have learned to keep learning from whatever challenges I face. To think outside the box. To learn how to see things in a bigger perspective yet understand what small details. To never take things personally if there are people who drag me down and belittles me. To be myself, be unique and to never pretend to be a better person you are not - just to prove myself to others expectations. To be open and true to yourself and work to your goals - not for others, but for the best self. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  My Advice to all women and anyone who belongs to underrepresented groups who want to work in Tech Industry
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To follow your heart, your dreams, dare speak up and never give up! To find a good mentor and good role models. Follow the desires of your heart and what you want to achieve. To never give when everything seems hopeless. Value your good contacts and network with people in tech. Dare speak up your thoughts even if you feel uncomfortable. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Another 8th of March, yet we are not still there!
</title>
      <author>Edagul Erten</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Mar 2021 15:17:21 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/edaerten1/another-8th-of-march-yet-we-are-not-still-there-469a</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/edaerten1/another-8th-of-march-yet-we-are-not-still-there-469a</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Where are we about equality in tech in 2021? Aren't we still there yet? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How long does it take to get there to have true equality in the tech industry? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time of the pandemic and working from home shouldn't absorb people's voices and give companies to be a ghost if there are employees who belong to minority groups in tech who haven't have sufficient resources to be productive at home and can't raise their voices enough. It is the responsibility of the organization which needs to push and makes sure to have people's voices heard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are still seeing posts in 2021 telling us that if you want more women in tech then start training them. I believe to the opposite that it's not the problem we don't have enough women educated in tech, but the problem should be somewhere else if you don't see enough in your organization. I believe unconscious bias is something serious as much as conscious bias and people should have trained regularly since unconscious bias could be a very sneaky disease. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think about the math of the problem to get the equality equation right, you need to put absent positive values to fill the gap from the past that we had collected enough negative ones. The inevitable result is that the equation will never be achieved if only women who are the one embracing the equality approach in the tech industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To seeing enormous companies which we had seen diversity term in action when they were a start-up are taking the backward side of the road is just frustrating. Carrying the diversity in a company shouldn't be reminding employees that they are not male in tech, diversity should be about different voices we have that would contribute our products from different angles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to reports by TrustRadius[1], women are more likely to be laid off and have more pressure in terms of productivity than men in the tech industry which is still having issues about under-represented women. In addition to the burden taken by women for child care is 20% higher than men and the pandemic increases family responsible by 60%, we should be aware of the pandemic, and working from home opens the gap in terms of equality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel very lucky to see people in my organization embracing the same approach. I have started my tech journey when I was in high school and started to deny the fact that it is a male-dominated environment. Now I'm finally feeling that I can raise my voice in my organization freely and my voice has no different than majority groups, however, not every woman or minority in tech has the same environment and that shows that we are not even close to accomplishing equality in 2021. If we are concerned about newly graduated women will eventually face an unconscious bias somewhere in their path until finding the right environment, this means we have a lot to do. If you have never seen any injustice towards women in tech, raise your voice for others, but if you do, you should have been already raised your voice by now with no excuse. Look at the glass ceiling and break it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now if this is not the right time to face your work environment and make it better for being equal in terms of diversity, then when is? I believe this is time to ask if we are where we want to be in terms of equality in the tech industry since every effort counts. Women do not need anything but equality on the 8th of march and every other day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's time for the tech industry to walk away from toxic masculinity and lead by example to the world. "The world is waking up, and change is coming whether you like or not."&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Importance of Self-Advocacy for Career Advancement</title>
      <author>Nahrin Jalal</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Mar 2021 15:15:55 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/nahrinjalal/the-importance-of-self-advocacy-for-career-advancement-2nh6</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/nahrinjalal/the-importance-of-self-advocacy-for-career-advancement-2nh6</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year marks five years (!) since I &lt;a href="https://dev.to/nahrinjalal/the-one-where-i-share-my-journey-to-tech-anj"&gt;started my career in the tech industry&lt;/a&gt;. To commemorate the milestone, I want to share a practice that has played a monumental role in my career advancement over this time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consistent self-advocacy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often tell &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NahrinJalal/status/1050078722605416450"&gt;my students&lt;/a&gt; how imperative it is to share their accomplishments and elevate their visibility regularly. A lot goes into this, such as weekly accomplishment tracking, connecting your achievements to compensation, scheduling weekly meetings with your manager, collecting testimonials, and more. However, the most repeated blocker I hear is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People don't know how to tell their story effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stories have three parts: a problem, a solution, and a result. If you accomplished something at work recently, you likely had to go through all three of those phases to that point. So now it's time to think about yourself as the protagonist of this story and share it with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#crafting-your-story" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Crafting Your Story
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, reflect on a professional accomplishment that you're proud of—ideally one that took place recently. Then, answer these questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What challenge did you overcome?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you break into a new industry or find success with a difficult client? What is the headline of your story?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlight your contribution.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Briefly share how &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; solution addressed the issue. How were your strengths and passions essential?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the business impact?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did you make money or save money for the company? Did you contribute to innovation, revenue, growth, or culture?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember to keep your story short! Your final result should be about 3-4 sentences (or bullet points) long. Your manager doesn't have time to read an essay, but she will appreciate and remember your impact if she can quickly understand how you solved a problem for the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, bear in mind that not every key accomplishment may fit into this storytelling structure. Please still share those other accomplishments with your manager—ensuring that you're still effectively highlighting how you impacted the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it all boils down to how you made a difference. Be proud of what you have achieved and share your accomplishments widely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#seek-support-when-you-need-it" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Seek Support When You Need It
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-advocacy is difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're struggling, remember that you are &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; the only one feeling this way, and it &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; get easier with practice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, never think you need to go it alone. Reach out to a mentor. Vent to a trusted friend. Let this incredible community support you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Most Recent Achievement Was...</title>
      <author>Debra-Kaye Elliott</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Mar 2021 14:55:50 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/debrakayeelliott/my-most-recent-achievement-was-1al2</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/debrakayeelliott/my-most-recent-achievement-was-1al2</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It's been a year of lows, highs and more lows. To say challenging would be putting it mildly. The struggles continue. Nevertheless, I coded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the midst of the lows, the highs I achieved were both unexpected and amazing 💙:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My first tech blog post &lt;a href="https://dev.to/debrakayeelliott/navigating-the-world-of-web-development-4eao"&gt;Navigating the World of Web Development&lt;/a&gt; relating to so many others in the dev community on this journey &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finding the Virtual Coffee community that's so supportive of where I am and encourage me to never give up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being featured by CodeNewbie for the &lt;a href="https://community.codenewbie.org/codenewbie/debra-kaye-elliott-the-go-getter-43mh"&gt;February 2021 Community Member Spotlight&lt;/a&gt;, my biggest achievement ever! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This journey is not one to be navigated alone. It has been challenging. It has been demotivating, more times than I care to admit. It has made me feel like I'm not progressing. This is why participating in the right communities is &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; important. The right people will meet you where you are and not judge you, will help you through your struggles, help you learn, encourage you to keep going and celebrate your wins with you. The saying goes "Surround yourself with positive and uplifting people," and those are the only types of people I want in my circle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My biggest goal is to be the best developer I can be, and work with great people in a supportive environment. A developer will do great work and grow in an environment where they're supported, their voice is heard, their team listens, they feel valued and are celebrated. That's where I want to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's been more than a challenging journey. Nevertheless, I coded.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dealing with discomfort. Change.</title>
      <author>Holger Blank</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Mar 2021 13:51:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/s2engineers/dealing-with-discomfort-change-3boo</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/s2engineers/dealing-with-discomfort-change-3boo</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I rarely, if ever, talk or write about my personal journey in public. Mainly because I feel uncomfortable while doing so. Time to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my time as a co-organizer of tech-community events  like &lt;a href="https://jsconf.eu"&gt;JSConf EU&lt;/a&gt; and others for the last 10+ years I had the opportunity to listen and learn a lot. But as I figured out really soon, I also had the need to learn a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It hasn't been that one single event that helped me to see the undeniable structural facts of our unequal society and workplaces around me. I learned, slowly, over years. I was able to see things clearer over time. Most of the time I felt uncomfortable with a lot of things I've seen and learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my personal journey, as a highly privileged white-male, I was lucky to have a group of people around me that helped me to reflect the situation, making me feel uncomfortable, developing my views including also co-creating small things that hopefully made a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I'm glad that the team I'm working with most of the time, is not only incredibly open for change but also drives a lot of change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raffaele (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pixari"&gt;@pixari&lt;/a&gt;) from our Munich based team wrote an incredible article about his journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest spending 11 minutes reading that one (not only) to every of my male colleagues. I also propose to spend many more minutes following all the links he has collected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next post I recommend reading is from Feli (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kotzendekrabbe"&gt;@kotzendekrabbe&lt;/a&gt;). Feli and me first met at JSConf EU 2015, since 2016 we're working together. Since then, Feli made me feel uncomfortable more than once. I'm thankful for every single time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Becoming uncomfortable is always my starting point for change. And it could become yours too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest not only to allow others to make you feel uncomfortable, but creating a culture where everybody is aware of their unearned privileges and is fostering a culture where being confronted is valued as a joint and common starting point of change.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wasn't sure if I wanted to write one of these this year. If you're on twitter you may know that last week was full of bad sexist takes that were incredibly demoralizing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, it's tradition. Once a year, I walk away from tutorials and tech posts, and I write about all the things I don't normally choose or want to write about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, I want to take about lived experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all move through the world a bit differently. Yet we all have similar experiences as humans. Those may seem like conflicting statements, but they're not. And it's more important than ever that we understand that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I move through this industry as a white woman. There is inherent challenge in that to be sure. Some of which I didn't truly experience until this year, for myriad reasons. And having that experience diminished or ignored is hurtful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I share a story of discrimination, however well-intended, a man telling me what to do differently next time is unhelpful. They're telling me what they would do, what would work for them. But they've never experienced this industry as I do. And what works for them won't work for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I'm a white woman. So that means there are just as many experiences of discrimination and harm caused by this industry that I have not experienced. And my advice does not belong in those conversations. Because I don't know how to navigate the experience of a Black woman, or a disabled woman, or so many others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My job is to believe those experiences. Full stop. To listen, to learn, to find ways to advocate with the voice and privilege I have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discrimination exists on a spectrum. I expect those who don't experience sexism to listen to my lived experiences. To believe me. To learn from me. But intersectionality is everything. And I have a lot to learn too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coding may be for machines, but this industry is full of people. And we have a long way to go until everyone has the same experiences and opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy International Women's Day!✨💖👯&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;

  My name is just Sharon, I do not have any nicknames(at least that I know of)
&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Where do you work?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-do-you-do" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What do you do?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work as an Innovation and Business Development Manager at B. Braun Group, a healthcare company that manufactures medical devices and solutions. My job entails identifying internal and external innovative ideas which we can develop into new products to protect and improve the health of people across the world. &lt;/p&gt;

  Who or what inspired you to pursue the career you have today?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My high school Physics teacher inspired me to study engineering at the University. Since then, I've had an incredibly supportive network of mentors who have influenced the changes in my career path to what I'm doing today. &lt;/p&gt;

  My advice for allies to support underrepresented folks who code is...
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, never stop learning. Stay curious and updated in your field.&lt;br&gt;
Second, it is okay to have a non-linear career path. Keep an open mind and always be on the look out for new opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read - a lot! &lt;/p&gt;

  How would you describe your job to a bunch of 5 year olds
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find new companies which can be friends with my company, and we can all play together and make cool products that help sick people feel better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-cool-thing-are-you-working-on-right-now" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What cool thing are you working on right now?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm currently supporting the roll out of our new company strategy. It's exciting to see how a company that was founded over 180 years ago is adopting new technology and preparing for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-was-your-first-job" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What was your first job?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was an ICT4D Intern at a Community Knowledge Centre. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  What are the toughest challenges you've had at work?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overcoming Imposter Syndrome and learning to negotiate and advocate for myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-upcoming-technological-innovation-will-dramatically-impact-the-industry-in-the-next-five-years" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What upcoming technological innovation will dramatically impact the industry in the next five years?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artificial Intelligence and Robotics are dramatically changing the Healthcare industry, from enabling early detection to AI-assisted surgeries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-skill-do-you-think-everyone-should-learn" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What skill do you think everyone should learn?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hard to pick one - but I'd say everyone needs to pay as much attention to their soft skills as they do to their technical skills. Emotional intelligence, great communication skills and creative problem solving skills will get you very far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#have-you-taken-a-huge-leap-of-faith-at-work-did-it-pay-off" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Have you taken a huge leap of faith at work? Did it pay off?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes I have. I quit my job to move to a new country for a 1 year fellowship program that had no guaranteed future after that. It did pay off. I experienced a lot of growth over the one year, and the work that I did during the fellowship built a foundation for a new job with the same company. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  What do you do?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am Founder/CEO of GlobalX Investments/GlobalX Innovation Labs based in Nairobi, Kenya.  GlobalX's vision is to drive a more diverse, inclusive and competitive digital economy with a focus on emerging technologies, that opens up equal opportunities for all.

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Who or what inspired you to pursue the career you have today?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love working in tech because first, I like to make positive impact in society through innovations. Secondly, I get bored easily, so I like to do stuff that keeps me engaged and allows me to try different things, discover and keep learning. Being in tech allows me to do this. I always look forward to creating or being part of teams that create solutions for humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you heard of, seen, built or learnt how to build robots? Coded using scratch? Heard of, seen or built a drone or best still flown one? My work involves helping build or giving guidance/teaching individuals or companies to build or do these type of things. My work also involves helping people who create these things start/run businesses, just like the shopkeeper where you buy bread from runs their shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am working on an initiative that aims to increase the representation of women in Artificial Intelligence. This was born out of my participation in the ITCILO AI Lab between Aug-Nov 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-was-your-first-job" class="anchor"&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  What upcoming technological innovation will dramatically impact the industry in the next five years?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artificial Intelligence (AI)-related innovations are definitely the industry game changer. It is estimated that by 2030, AI will contribute $15.7 Trillion to the global GDP, making it the biggest commercial opportunity in today’s fast changing economy. AI basically refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving. From disease mapping and prediction tools; song or TV show recommendations from Spotify and Netflix; conversational bots for customer support and marketing; to delivery of blood to remote locations that would be typically hard-to-reach, AI has definitely had a major contribution so far and continues to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-skill-do-you-think-everyone-should-learn" class="anchor"&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Have you taken a huge leap of faith at work? Did it pay off?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes I have-getting into entrepreneurship. It has paid off especially in terms of impact, growing my professional brand as well as making me learn about myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A guy named Arthur Kennedy is the who introduced me to coding and opened up my mind about technology. His patience and brilliance made me want to be more like him. I am really grateful to him for that and the amazing ladies from Rails Girls Mombasa and Nairobi who we not only gave each other hope in our coding journey but took up the challenge to teach and inspire others.&lt;/p&gt;

  How would you describe your job to a bunch of 5 year olds
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the apps you use on the internet? I build those😎.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-cool-thing-are-you-working-on-right-now" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What cool thing are you working on right now?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently worked on implementing a feature that allows you to link your your forms from ona to Tableau for visualization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-was-your-first-job" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What was your first job?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does an intern count? I am currently at my first job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-are-the-toughest-challenges-youve-had-at-work" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What are the toughest challenges you've had at work?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started out as an intern, I had to learn a new language within the three months. It was also my first time working on code that goes to production. It was the toughest yet the best experience ever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-upcoming-technological-innovation-will-dramatically-impact-the-industry-in-the-next-five-years" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What upcoming technological innovation will dramatically impact the industry in the next five years?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe machine learning and robotics is something people will  embrace even more. 2020 has made us realize we don't really need to be at the same place to get things done therefore dependence on machines will increase as we move forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-skill-do-you-think-everyone-should-learn" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What skill do you think everyone should learn?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;critical thinking. You might be a good developer but if you can't think how to implement your code, you will stay at the same place. As my mentor says, coding is easy as long as you know what you are coding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#have-you-taken-a-huge-leap-of-faith-at-work-did-it-pay-off" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Have you taken a huge leap of faith at work? Did it pay off?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think pick up features or new technologies at work is always a leap of faith for me. Sometimes I might take longer to even deliver but my end goal is not to just complete but to come out better and with knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy International Women's Day!✨💖👯&lt;/p&gt;

  My name is just Celine, I do not have any nicknames(at least that I know of)
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#where-do-you-work" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Where do you work?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am an incoming software engineer at Slack. Will be working on the front-end. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-do-you-do" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What do you do?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a software engineer. I am also a you-tuber and make tech content specifically. I also write about technology, most especially software engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#who-or-what-inspired-you-to-pursue-the-career-you-have-today" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Who or what inspired you to pursue the career you have today?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always been fascinated by tech ever since I was a kid. I particularly chose to pursue a software engineering career because I loved how it gave me the opportunity to solve problems as well as create things that are important for humanity. I also love how versatile my career is, especially because I am that person who enjoys exploring new things, hence as a software engineer, I  am able to do a lot of different things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-your-favourite-music-genre" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is your favourite music genre?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love Afro beats, I listen to bongo a lot. Lately started listening to 'Amapiano'.  We can say that I listen to a lot of African music&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  My advice for allies to support underrepresented folks who code is...
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be open to learning. Learning is something that is never ending in life and being open to it will for sure open a lot of opportunities for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-do-you-keep-yourself-up-to-date-in-your-field" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How do you keep yourself up to date in your field?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google is my best friend. I am always looking out for what is new in the field and learning it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-cool-thing-are-you-working-on-right-now" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What cool thing are you working on right now?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I am excited about finally launching  a program that I have always wanted to start. It will be a mentor-ship program for women in stem. I have always wanted to empower other women and it means a lot to me that I am finally going to be able to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-was-your-first-job" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What was your first job?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worked as a student library assistant&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-skill-do-you-think-everyone-should-learn" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What skill do you think everyone should learn?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think learning how to code is fundamental, especially with how the world is quickly become technologically oriented&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
