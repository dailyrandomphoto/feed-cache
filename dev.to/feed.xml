      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pandemic has had drastic effects on the world economy leaving many people jobless, but the IT industry has stood the storm quite well. It has been one of the few most stable fields. The thrashing effects of COVID-19 do not seem to be even touching the IT industry as it is rapidly growing and is all set to hit close to &lt;a href="https://www.idc.com/promo/global-ict-spending/forecast"&gt;$6 trillion&lt;/a&gt; by 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pace of IT market growth is quite impressive. It is presumed that the IT outsourcing market seems to be growing from a figure of $342.9 billion in 2020 to &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200714005552/en/Global-IT-Outsourcing-Industry-2020-to-2027---Market-Trajectory-Analytics---ResearchAndMarkets.com"&gt;$410.2 billion by 2027&lt;/a&gt;, which is unimaginably high in such a condition of global economic crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This begs for the need for more IT experts in the field and it seems to grow from 24 million currently to over &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/627312/worldwide-developer-population/"&gt;28.7 million IT experts&lt;/a&gt; and developers by 2024. If you’ve responded to this need and want to start a career in IT, here are some aspects of the job, and the learning curve leading up to it, you should be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#essentials-you-should-know-before-starting-a-career-in-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Essentials You Should Know Before Starting a Career in IT
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a beginner at anything can be frustrating. You might be unsure about every single step you take or lack help in choosing a career, programming language, or devising a learning plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following is an account of 10 things that might sound so simple to many IT experts but weren’t so obvious at the start of their IT career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#focus-on-practicebased-learning"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Focus on Practice-Based Learning
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beginners often place too much emphasis on theory, while programming is a kind of practical skill. So, ensure you’re focusing on the practical part, coding itself. So when you are choosing programming learning sources, keep in mind code practicing availability. Here we have the top five online programming courses and platforms where you can find such courses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#codecademy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://www.codecademy.com/"&gt;Codecademy&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Codecademy is an effective online resource with professional guidance to start off with basics. But make sure to practice the concepts yourself, as their course lacks the practical part to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#stanford-online"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://online.stanford.edu/"&gt;Stanford Online&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stanford Online has an excellent number of introductory courses with many teaching assistants that help students understand the Basics of IT thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#udacity"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://www.udacity.com/"&gt;Udacity&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Udacity has many courses launched for individuals, for businesses and even government. It offers an extensive learning archive and the assistance of the mentors. Which is quite helpful to learn programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#codegym"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://codegym.cc/"&gt;Codegym&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Codegym Java course contains 1200+ practical tasks. It starts with the basics, Java Syntax, and logically moves to the complicated learning. The best part is that 80% of the learning process is based on practical assignments, which helps you grasp programming quite well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#edx"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://www.edx.org/"&gt;EdX&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonnes of tutorials on edX help build the useful concepts that every programmer requires to start his career in IT, especially programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#communicate"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Communicate
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newbies lack experience and don’t consider seeking guidance from experts. Make sure that you aren’t one of those beginners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joining communities such as &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/"&gt;Stackoverflow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://coderanch.com/"&gt;CodeRanch&lt;/a&gt; and others don’t only have you covered for expert advice and guidance, but also provide you a sense of moral support. Create your account on &lt;a href="https://github.com/"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;, read and comment on &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/"&gt;HackerNews&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/"&gt;freeCodeCamp&lt;/a&gt;… Look for different communities!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can interact with your fellows who’re facing the same situations, being able to relate to someone else’s progress helps a lot with releasing stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The communities have thousands of IT experts with years of hands-on experience who can show you the actual picture of many situations and keep you from taking wrong turns as you head towards your goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are a few resources you can browse for advice and support:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/"&gt;Stackoverflow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Javaranch.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reddit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/"&gt;r/AskProgramming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/"&gt;r/LearnProgramming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.r-project.org/"&gt;r/Coding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CodingHelp/"&gt;r/CodingHelp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#develop-a-habit-of-good-research"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Develop a Habit of Good Research
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never try to save your time on research. Google is a whole world of information. Superficial skimming about a certain topic won’t help you at all. But do it in moderation, otherwise you risk burying yourself in a heap of informational waste. So, build a habit of diligent research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#stick-to-basics-at-the-start"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Stick to Basics at the Start
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practice is essential no doubt, but you won’t be able to practice without solid base knowledge, so go step-by-step and do not skip learning the fundamentals of programming first before moving on to the concepts of higher complexity. This way learning complicated levels would be easier. Skipping the basics is just like skipping the alphabet and directly heading towards writing a whole essay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#learn-several-programming-languages"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Learn Several Programming Languages
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many beginners stick to one programming language only and deem it sufficient, while others think that learning many of them at once is a good idea. But both of them are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking the right decision regarding what languages to learn and how to order them is important. Do not try to stuff your brain with many languages at a time, though settling for just one programming language for the rest of your career isn’t good either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take it in a sequential order, and start from Java, for example. It has a robust structure that helps you develop a very thorough understanding of how programming actually works. After that, grasping other languages won’t be that hectic for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#be-open-for-changes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Be Open for Changes
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with a “know-it-all” attitude doesn’t work well with an IT career. No matter how long you’ve been in the field or how well you have trained yourself at it, there’s always a lot to learn about programming as this field is one of the fastest-growing ones. Growth comes with several changes and innovations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the programming field is growing daily, do not try to be stubborn about your concepts, never step out of the way of learning. Keep learning new things and stay up-to-date and well informed to the maximum possible level. Because obviously, you don’t want to be somebody with old-school technical knowledge. You need to keep up the pace if you wish to stay in the race!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#organize-yourself"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Organize Yourself
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a mess can end you up with a mess! And here, mess refers to those unorganized working patterns. Being unorganized can generally be disastrous to not only your work but to your mental health as well. No doubt what you do is important but how you do it is equally important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a programmer and unorganized would only increase your pressure reducing your efficiency. Organize your projects, set reminders, make schedules for yourself accordingly and make sure to follow them. Without schedules all you do is waste your time, ending up all stressed out and frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#focus-on-fewer-things-at-a-time"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Focus on Fewer Things at a Time
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people can’t help thinking about things they are not doing and need to do while doing other things. Similarly, other people tend to commit to more than one task at a time. They wonder if this might be a good way to increase efficiency levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But unfortunately, the reality is the other way around. Trying to handle more than 1 task at a time will just end up messing up all the tasks you’re trying to accomplish. Try to focus on one of your goals, whether it’s a project or learning a programming language, everything takes a lot of individual focus and attention to be accomplished quite well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#fight-the-obstacles"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Fight the Obstacles
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most heart-breaking part is to see talented people giving up as they see obstacles coming their way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t give up no matter what, believe in yourself and your potential energy that can help you fight every single obstacle. No matter how hard things might get in your way, be ready to face it. And in no time you’ll gain confidence that will make you simply unstoppable in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#relax-and-enjoy-your-work"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Relax and Enjoy Your Work
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People say that if you love your work, you don’t work a single day in your life. You’re just having fun every day. And no professional can be good at their work unless they love it and are passionate about it. Similar is the case with IT professionals, no doubt this requires long hours of focus. But the day you fall in love with what you do, you definitely will not want to stop and programming would be your favorite piece of cake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, just relax and do not stress yourself about things that get frustrating in the beginning. Just love your work and things will start getting a lot better in just no time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These 10 recommendations have been deduced by many experts to help newbies see a bigger picture at the start to understand things better and not take steps they might regret taking later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you’re not a beginner and regret some moves, it’s never too late to make a change. So stick to these 10 tips to make sure you never end up saying that “wish I knew this in the start!” at some point in your career. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every Tuesday we round up the previous week's top posts based on traffic, engagement, and a hint of editorial curation. The typical week starts on Monday and ends on Sunday, but don't worry, we take into account posts that are published later in the week.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

  Out of the darkness and into the light
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's entirely understandable why dark mode is the preferred mode for lots of devs — but let's play devil's advocate for a moment with &lt;a class="mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/sewangco"&gt;@sewangco&lt;/a&gt;
 to explore why light mode might actually be a better choice for some (don't @ me!)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Best Programming Languages You Can Learn as a Java Developer</title>
      <author>John Selawsky</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/selawsky/best-programming-languages-you-can-learn-as-a-java-developer-1hpa</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you heard of Polyglot coders? They are those code developers who know more than one programming language, and they are really in high demand in 2021. Many job interviewers look for them because they’re the odd ones out who has more on their plate to give. New technologies arrive every year, and one language is often not enough to implement what is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new language will give you space to be further creative with your codes since all of them have different concepts and cool new features to play with. Moreover, it can open new doors in your career and become a ticket to the best projects and teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, you will find three programming languages Java developers should learn in 2021 and the reasons why. There is no surprise that all of these programming languages are JVM-based but they all have different qualities that make them unique and useful for a certain task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#start-with-proper-practice-in-java"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Start with Proper Practice in Java
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may sound obvious, but before starting learning a new language, you have to verify your Java skill. As with every prominent technology, Java lives and develops, and you could miss some recent updates. Here is a list of some online resources you can use for your practice in Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#codegym"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  CodeGym
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://codegym.cc/"&gt;CodeGym&lt;/a&gt; teaches you Java like you would play a game. So if you like playing video games, and you like being rewarded when you go up levels (who doesn’t, right?!), then this is the Java learning course you must go for. There are quests and side quests (RPG-players wink wink) and thousands of levels to learn Java. Moreover, you get to fix other people’s codes, learn the basics and the syntax, all on the way to a Junior Java Developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#codechef"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  CodeChef
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.codechef.com/"&gt;CodeChef&lt;/a&gt; is a non-profit competitive programming language learning website that gives you choice-based questions and urges you to continue coding till you get the accepted answer. The other outputs are also shown, which is helpful for you to understand where you went wrong in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#codewars"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Codewars
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.codewars.com/"&gt;Codewars&lt;/a&gt; is for developers who are somewhat advanced in their coding journey and no longer need to know the basics all that well. Codewars introduced katas or puzzle coding to the world. This makes it a new ray of sunlight in the otherwise dusty corridors of coding. However, for beginners, other sites would be recommended more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cyberdojo"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cyber-dojo
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, better for intermediate or advanced programmers, &lt;a href="https://www.cyber-dojo.org/creator/home"&gt;Cyber-dojo&lt;/a&gt; uses TDD or Test Driven Development to challenge Java developers. The tester writes a test case, and the developer has to keep writing and rewriting the code till there are zero unsuccessful test cases left. Fun? Yes. Good for new people? Not really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#top-3-programming-languages-java-developers-can-learn-in-2021"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Top 3 Programming Languages Java Developers Can Learn in 2021
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning Java can be one of the first steps to learning a new coding language. Learning how to solve Java-based problems and understanding the basics makes you able to learn other languages because many basic principles are similar. Three JVM-based languages in the list will complement your skills in Java and enrich your arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#scala"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Scala
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scala was introduced in 2004 as the language that can run on Java Virtual Machine. Scala also follows the WORA principle; it supports some features of object-oriented programming and functional programming. Actually, Scala was created to fill the gap in the that-time Java version. In the beginning, it was considered to be that language that would end up replacing Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, that did not happen, mainly when a few new and functional programming features got added to Java 8, such as the lambdas and the stream. Java regained its popularity and saved the leadership. Nonetheless, Scala is a helpful language to learn for Java coders. Apache Spark, an open-source engine for large-scale data processing, is written on Scala. White Big Data became a buzzword in digital technologies; it also opened a set of opportunities for the wise guys and language polyglots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this and other reasons, Scala has gotten an enormous fanbase over the last few years since several companies and new businesses started to use it. Uber, Amazon, Sony, Autodesk, Twitter use it, which has now turned it into popular coding languages. It is still not on the top: in 2020, it was &lt;a href="https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2020/02/28/language-rankings-1-20/"&gt;ranked 17th by GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, based on the number of projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Scala is still the language to learn for Java developers. Java is actively used for mobile development. The best Scala frameworks like Akka, Spark, and Play also help businesses take up Scala for web and Big Data solutions. If you plan to develop a career in one of these fields, Scala is a good choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is more? Scala developers are so much in demand that to learn it well would ensure &lt;a href="https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries/Scala-Developer-Salary#:~:text=As%20of%20Apr%209%2C%202021,%2Fweek%20or%20%2411%2C608%2Fmonth."&gt;120K USD as an average salary per year, which makes $10,000 per month&lt;/a&gt;. The amount can vary from country to country, and the highest Scala salary is in Norway. So, if you are a Norwegian Java developer looking for a new language, there is no reason to wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommended Book&lt;/strong&gt;: Scala for the Impatient by Cay S. Horstman is a book for all beginners. It is lucid, has proper basics and syntax training, and will help you start with a bang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#kotlin"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Kotlin
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kotlin was started in the year 2011 by the JetBrains Team Blog, who are also the creators of IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, and several more high-ranking IDEs. Kotlin is JVM-based and can compile down Java easily. It is possible to use Kotlin in a Java or Android project from the middle of work, and staff will work out okay. This makes Kotlin your go-to best friend now with relief from &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NullPointerException&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and other very cool new features to boot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Kotlin was not given much attention by most programmers till Google called it the best and official programming language for the sharpest Android Development in their 2017 Google IO. Since that time, the popularity of Kotlin has grown, and in 2019 it was ranked 4th by GitHub. Approximately 30% of developers use Kotlin, especially in mobile development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the world goes mobile, all programming languages that are used for mobile development are popular. Kotlin also can be used for IoT applications, web applications, and game development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with Google, Kotlin is used by the following bug brands: Amazon, Netflix, task management tool Trello, Uber, and many others. They appreciate reliability, easy management, and high development speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The median salary of the Kotlin developer is $&lt;a href="https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries/Kotlin-Developer-Salary#:~:text=As%20of%20Apr%209%2C%202021,%2Fweek%20or%20%2410%2C628%2Fmonth."&gt;130,000&lt;/a&gt;, which is slightly higher than for Java. The reason is that in 2017–2020 the labor market struggled from the lack of Kotlin developers. However, since that time, many developers have entered this market. The salary is different in various countries: the highest amount a Kotlin developer can get in the United States, while in Australia and India the pay is lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommended Book&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Kotlin in Action&lt;/em&gt; is a comprehensive guide to this popular programming language, and what’s better? The official website of Kotlin has all the answers to the exercises in the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#groovy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Groovy
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Groovy is a JVM-based coding language that really adds to your Java programming with the brief codes, the def to define whatever you need, and great new features like multi-strings and collection literals. Groovy also helps reduce the development time with shortened expressions and the best unit testing Spock framework ever. Two languages are entirely compatible, but Groovy is more compact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not easy to name some big companies that use Groovy: they only add it to the tech stack. Among them are the online money transfer services TransferWise and Starbucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Groovy is mostly used for the scripts above Java code. It is a perfect option for the often changing tasks. Tiobe index of language popularity ranked Groovy #19 in 2019, but this is an upward change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Groove-Software-Engineer-Salaries-E1411195_D_KO7,24.htm"&gt;Glassdoor reports&lt;/a&gt; the average Groovy developer can make $122,000 per year. However, the same service registers only 45 jobs in 2020 for this skill. It seems the employees prefer hiring so-called T-shaped specialists that are good in basic skill and can also perform effectively. In this context, T-shaped developers can combine Java and Groovy in their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommended book&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Making Java Groovy&lt;/em&gt; is the book that you can definitely check out. It is so interactive and straightforward that it will have you writing Groovy scripts in a few hours!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a real professional aim for a software developer to become a polyglot coder and learn more than one programming language. With Java solely it is possible to build a career in the IT industry. Java engineers are in high demand, and the upward trend shows the market is hungry for more of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for those who want to grow up as professionals and create the T-shaped skills profile, there are three JVM-compatible languages: Scala, Kotlin, and Groovy. Each of these languages has its unique benefits, so combining two languages can make a better result.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Queue Data Structure</title>
      <author>Aya Bouchiha</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/ayabouchiha/queue-data-structure-2hfg</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi, today, we're going to discuss queue :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#definition-of-queue"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Definition Of Queue
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Queue is a linear data structure that stores items in a &lt;strong&gt;First-In/First-Out&lt;/strong&gt; (FIFO) manner. In Queue, the element that goes in first is the element that comes out first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Uodo0b3R--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/40x3kk89j56hq9t95ix0.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Uodo0b3R--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/40x3kk89j56hq9t95ix0.jpg" alt="queue data structure"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#space-and-time-complexity"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Space and Time complexity
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the space complexity of a queue is &lt;em&gt;O(n)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;add ( enqueue )&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;remove (dequeue)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;search&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;access&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;O(1)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;O(1)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;O(n)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;O(n)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;front&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;rear&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; 
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;isFull&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;rear&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; 
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; added'&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'full'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;isEmpty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>Why you need an SSH Access Manager - Part 2</title>
      <author>Mike Barlow</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Jun 2021 18:45:50 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/serverauth/why-you-need-an-ssh-access-manager-part-2-512o</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/serverauth/why-you-need-an-ssh-access-manager-part-2-512o</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before diving into this article I recommend you take 5 minutes to have a read of part 1 of our 2 part, "&lt;a href="https://serverauth.com/posts/why-you-need-an-ssh-access-manager"&gt;Why you need an SSH Access Manager&lt;/a&gt;" blog series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part 1 of our article featured more information on the security aspects for why to use one but in this article, I want to talk more about the "managing" of SSH keys as a reason to use one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#authorized-keys"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Authorized Keys
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To define which SSH keys have access to your server, each server user has its own directory and within, a folder called &lt;code&gt;.ssh&lt;/code&gt;. This folder should have a file called &lt;code&gt;authorized_keys&lt;/code&gt; and the purpose of this file is to hold the public key for each SSH key that should have access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a very simple system that works great, as it's a simple case of adding a new public key on a new line in the file and saving it, (or deleting a line to remove access).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#flaws"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Flaws
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This however, does come with some flaws! (Doesn't everything?) In the first instance, this requires you to have access to that server yourself to add a new SSH key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, this won't cause too much of a problem but there could be times when you need access to a server but have just got a new computer. Or maybe, you reformatted and didn't back your SSH keys up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another problem with this is that these authorized keys are not shared between servers. So if you are the manager/team leader and have someone new join your team, have fun logging into every server and adding the persons public key to the authorized keys file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the last main flaws is like the last but in reverse! You have a team member leave and you now need to remember every server they had access to and you have to log in to each one and search the authorized keys file to remove their access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-pandemic"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Pandemic
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent pandemic and the work from home movement has shown a rise in the people working from home rather than the office. This means a higher number of people most likely working on new machines, which in turn means more SSH keys needing to be added to servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then if that person leaves, you also now have to find and remove, not just one, but two SSH keys across every server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, with people starting to return to the office, there will be a need to add SSH keys from your work machines to any new servers created during the pandemic, creating more unnecessary for the team leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#solutions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Solutions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where an SSH Access Manager like &lt;a href="https://serverauth.com"&gt;ServerAuth&lt;/a&gt; steps in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ServerAuth gives you a central place to manage all your SSH Access. Simply create your servers, add your users and grant access all within our platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your users with a ServerAuth account will then be able to log in and add all their SSH keys. Once added, ServerAuth will automatically sync all of the users' SSH keys to every server that you have given them access to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find yourself away from your main computer and needing server access? Or have you reformatted your machine and forgot to back up your old SSH key? Simply grab this new machines SSH key, log in to ServerAuth and add the key to your account and wait for it to sync!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#try-it-now"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Try it now!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it's not the main thing in most teams tech stacks, an SSH Access Manager is something that teams should start considering. We built ServerAuth in response to our personal experiences and know it will help others!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The 3 best features announced at Next.js Conf</title>
      <author>Thomas Ledoux</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Jun 2021 18:40:51 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/thomasledoux1/the-3-best-features-announced-at-next-js-conf-1ipa</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/thomasledoux1/the-3-best-features-announced-at-next-js-conf-1ipa</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Vercel (the company behind Next.js) announced a special edition of their Next.js Conf last month. &lt;br&gt;
This was announced as a collaboration with the Google Chrome team, so I was certainly excited!&lt;br&gt;
What could be expected on beforehand was even more speed and page loading optimisations and a better developer experience built in to the framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they delivered on that!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://nextjs.org/blog/next-11"&gt;Next.js 11&lt;/a&gt; was announced, these are my top 3 features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conformance"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conformance
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a system created on top of ESLint, with a set of predefined rules. &lt;br&gt;
These rules will help you as a developer to avoid mistakes which could negatively influence your Core Web Vitals.&lt;br&gt;
This could be something like forgetting to set a width and height on your images, not using the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Image&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; component from next/image, not using the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Link&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; component for &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; internal links..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use this feature, just install the Next.js 11 using &lt;code&gt;npm install next@latest&lt;/code&gt; in your project, and then run &lt;code&gt;npx next lint&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
This will create a &lt;code&gt;.eslintrc&lt;/code&gt; file, and you will get your errors/warnings in your terminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already upgraded my &lt;a href="https://thomasledoux.be"&gt;personal website&lt;/a&gt; to Next.js 11, and it was smooth as always. &lt;br&gt;
Once installed, I ran the &lt;code&gt;next lint&lt;/code&gt; command, and immediately found some possible optimizations!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#image-optimisations"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Image optimisations
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next.js is already doing a lot of image optimisations when you use their &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Image&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; component, and they added some more!&lt;br&gt;
In Next.js 11 the width and height of your local images are detected automatically, so you don't have to set them manually anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a possibility to add a blurred placeholder for your image while it's loading. &lt;br&gt;
Just add &lt;code&gt;placeholder="blur"&lt;/code&gt; to your local &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Image&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and it will work out of the box.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// example from the docs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Image&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;author&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;alt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Picture of the author"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;placeholder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"blur"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you want to apply this placeholder to external images (coming from a DAM for example), you can provide the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Image&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; with a &lt;code&gt;blurDataURL&lt;/code&gt; property. &lt;br&gt;
This should contain a base64-encoded image.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// example from the docs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Image&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://nextjs.org/static/images/learn.png"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;blurDataURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAIAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAb/xAAhEAACAQMDBQAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMABAUGIWEREiMxUf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMF/8QAGhEAAgIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECEgMRkf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AltJagyeH0AthI5xdrLcNM91BF5pX2HaH9bcfaSXWGaRmknyJckliyjqTzSlT54b6bk+h0R//2Q=="&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;alt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Picture of the author"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;placeholder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"blur"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A little preview of what it looks like on my website: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gw4rixzszthneoa640qv.gif"&gt;https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gw4rixzszthneoa640qv.gif&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#nextjs-live"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Next.js Live
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is Next.js' attempt to make the development process more inclusive, so you can easily collaborate with (non-technical) colleagues. &lt;br&gt;
Next.js Live puts your development environment into the browser. You get a live URL where everyone you share this URL with can see what you are working on in real time!&lt;br&gt;
You can even do live code changes in the browser which are immediately reflected on the website. &lt;br&gt;
There's also a possibility for people to draw on the website to point out potential problems, or to give feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's currently in closed beta, but you can already register &lt;a href="https://nextjs.org/live"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
If you want to already try it out with an example project, that's also possible &lt;a href="https://vercel.com/new/git/external?demo-description=An%20all-in-one%20starter%20kit%20for%20high-performance%20e-commerce%20sites.&amp;amp;demo-image=https%3A%2F%2Fbigcommerce-demo-asset-ksvtgfvnd.vercel.app%2Fbigcommerce.png&amp;amp;demo-title=Next.js%20Commerce&amp;amp;demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fdemo.vercel.store&amp;amp;project-name=commerce&amp;amp;repository-name=commerce&amp;amp;repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fcommerce%2Ftree%2Fcustom-checkout&amp;amp;live=1"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So some nice announcements, and definitely something to look forward to with Next.js live!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JavaScript-30-Day-15</title>
      <author>KUMAR HARSH</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Jun 2021 18:26:54 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/cenacr007_harsh/javascript-30-day-15-l8j</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/cenacr007_harsh/javascript-30-day-15-l8j</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#local-storage-and-event-delegation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;center&gt;Local Storage and Event Delegation &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#demo"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://cenacrharsh.github.io/JS-30-DAY-15/"&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sFj2H3sk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ohyafwii9n1zf1emtex6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sFj2H3sk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ohyafwii9n1zf1emtex6.png" alt="ss"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On day-15 we will learn how to make our state persistent by using local storage and learn how to use event delegation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a simple list by default where we can add items and also they also have checkboxes which we can check, but the data and state of checked/unchecked boxes will stay as long as we don't refresh the page, after which every thing will be reset, and we'll work to make the this change persistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the default HTML we have:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;ul&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"plates"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Loading Tapas...&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"add-items"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"text"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"item"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;placeholder=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Item Name"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;required&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"submit"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;value=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"+ Add Item"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We'll start by selecting the unordered list and the form element.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;addItems&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.add-items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;itemsList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.plates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We'll add a &lt;code&gt;submit&lt;/code&gt; eventlistener to form element&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addItems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;submit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;addItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;submit&lt;/code&gt;, this is because one can submit by using the keyboard as well hence to cover all our bases we use a &lt;code&gt;submit&lt;/code&gt; event listener.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now inside the &lt;code&gt;addItem&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;addItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;preventDefault&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;[name=item]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;populateList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;itemsList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;localStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;First of all we use &lt;code&gt;.preventDefault()&lt;/code&gt; method as by default the form is going to reload the page as soon as data is entered (generally to send data to server) and to prevent page from reloading we use the &lt;code&gt;preventDefault()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we need to take the input user gives inside the box and put it into an object using &lt;code&gt;const text = this.querySelector("[name=item]").value&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;querySelector&lt;/code&gt; gives us the input element which has a property called &lt;code&gt;.value&lt;/code&gt; which gives the text user has typed inside the input field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be thinking why this and not document for query selector. The &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; here contains the form and we are searching for the one with attribute &lt;code&gt;name=item&lt;/code&gt;. This technique is helpful when we are working with multiple forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we put the text into an object using&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;done&lt;/code&gt; is for whether the item is checked and we will make it true when we click the checkbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we will push the object into &lt;code&gt;items&lt;/code&gt; array using &lt;code&gt;items.push(item)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we call &lt;code&gt;populateList(items, itemsList)&lt;/code&gt; where we recreate the list every time user gives an input. The work of &lt;code&gt;populateList&lt;/code&gt; function is to basically generate the HTML for the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;this.reset()&lt;/code&gt; clears the input field after adding it to our list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the populateList() function:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;populateList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;plates&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;platesList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;platesList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerHTML&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;plates&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;plate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`
            &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;input type="checkbox" data-index=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; id="item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;" &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="nx"&gt;plate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;checked&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; /&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;label for="item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;plate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
            `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here we basically get the text and create a list item according to it and pass it to the list we already have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;plates = []&lt;/code&gt; prevents the code from breaking if we forget to supply the arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;id="item${i}"&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;for="item${i}"&lt;/code&gt; is same and that is how we link the label and input, when you click the label the input checks itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now after all this we can add whatever we type to our list but it is not peristent and so we use local storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local Storage&lt;/strong&gt; is simply a key-value store and we can only use strings to store data in local storage&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you try to put something other than a string into Local Storage, it will convert it and store it as string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we use &lt;code&gt;JSON.stringify&lt;/code&gt; to convert our objects/arrays into JSON string, and the method to set data in the storage is &lt;code&gt;setItem&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;localStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So we'll modify the &lt;code&gt;const items =[]&lt;/code&gt; started with to&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;const items = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("items")) || []&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here &lt;code&gt;getItem&lt;/code&gt; is used to take data our of local storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now on page load it tries to load data from local storage and if it fails then fallback value is &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we will work to make the toggling persistent, so that if we check an item it remains checked after refresh, but the problem is we can't listen for click events on list items because if we add new list items listeners won't work on them because input was created after we listened for them and hence they don't have eventListeners attached to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole idea of &lt;strong&gt;Event Delegation&lt;/strong&gt; is rather than listening for click/change on checkbox directly , what we do is we look for something which is already going to be on the page at the time of listening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at our html the &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt; or unordered list with class=plates does exist on the page.

&lt;p&gt;Hence we will listen for a click on the plates and then we wil find out &lt;strong&gt;Did they actually mean to click on one of the input inside of it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we click different items the target will be different and so we use &lt;code&gt;e.target&lt;/code&gt; and if it is not &lt;code&gt;input&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we will go to items array and find out what is the status of each items whether checked/uncheced and accordingly toggle it's value and set it into local storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the function:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;itemsList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;toggleDone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;toggleDone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;matches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//skip this unless it's an input&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;el&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;el&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dataset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;localStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;populateList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;itemsList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here we use the &lt;code&gt;data-index&lt;/code&gt; attribute we gave each element so that we know the position of each element inside our array and we use that index to manipulate the elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#so-in-short-everytime-we-make-a-change-we-mirror-that-change-to-local-storage-and-then-we-rerender-the-entire-list"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  So in short everytime we make a change, we mirror that change to local storage and then we rerender the entire list.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the complete javascript:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently launched a new theme to &lt;strong&gt;Loopple&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;Free Low Code Dashboard Builder&lt;/strong&gt; that aims to help developers to speed up their development process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new theme is built on top of &lt;strong&gt;Soft UI Dashboard by Creative Tim&lt;/strong&gt;, an Open Source &lt;strong&gt;Bootstrap 5 Dashboard&lt;/strong&gt;. Loopple currently has 2 themes and is still in Beta version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any feedback would be gratefully received!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Links:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>5 reactive UI interactions you'd better did instead of querying $elements</title>

      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is dedicated for a web developer who appreciates design freedom, yet who'd like to code less in a setup-free web-based development environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a &lt;strong&gt;5 DOM interaction you'd better did in a reactive way instead of using&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;jQuery&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;document.querySelector&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? - Because it's more maintainable and scalable. You can read more in one of my past &lt;a href="https://dev.to/chrisczopp/ready-to-move-from-jquery-to-shiny-reactivess-307o"&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The below snippets are meant to work with &lt;a href="https://www.glue.codes"&gt;GlueCodes Studio&lt;/a&gt; - the tool powering your every-day work in the ways you haven't seen elsewhere. It's for somebody who'd be pleased with loads of automation to deliver an extremely fast and scalable code i.e. build-time diffed JSX using &lt;a href="http://solidjs.com/"&gt;SolidJS&lt;/a&gt; organised around an implicit uni-directional data flow. Obviously you can use it for FREE, so let's begin!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-updating-a-css-class-on-a-button-click"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Updating a CSS class on a button click
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;button-x&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;uiSignals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;updateClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;some-class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;uiSignals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;updateClass&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Click
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/button-x&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-toggling-a-css-class-on-a-button-click"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Toggling a CSS class on a button click
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;button-x&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;uiSignals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;updateClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;some-class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;uiSignals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;updateClass&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;uiSignals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;updateClass&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Click
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/button-x&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: The snippets are made using a concept called "extended tags". Below you'll be seeing a global &lt;code&gt;uiSignals&lt;/code&gt; object being accessed in embedded &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;s. You can freerly set/get properties on/of this object. Think of it as a local UI state, something you'd see in React as hooks. What matters the most is that when a property of &lt;code&gt;uiSignals&lt;/code&gt; changes, only the DOM elements which access it get updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-switching-tabs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Switching tabs
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;span-x&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;uiSignals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;uiSignals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;activeTab&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;active&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;uiSignals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;activeTab&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Default tab (A)
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/span-x&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;span-x&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;uiSignals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;activeTab&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;active&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;fragment&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;gc-as=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"varPresenter"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"getSomeRecordsItem"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;repeated item&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/fragment&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some more directives in this snippet which you can read about &lt;a href="https://www.glue.codes/docs-templating-htmlDirectives.html#listItemPresenter"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Note that when an extended tag is placed inside a "list item presenter", you get access to a variable called: &lt;code&gt;providerName + Item&lt;/code&gt;, in our case &lt;code&gt;getSomeRecordsItem&lt;/code&gt; which is an item while looping over &lt;code&gt;getSomeRecords&lt;/code&gt; action result (an array). You could also access &lt;code&gt;getSomeRecordsIndex&lt;/code&gt; for a numeric index in the array.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-are-those-tagnamex-tags"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What are those tagName-x tags?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Static HTML has no built-in way to make it reactive. Hence, &lt;a href="https://www.glue.codes"&gt;GlueCodes Studio&lt;/a&gt; supports a concept called extended tags which is named like: &lt;code&gt;tagName + '-x'&lt;/code&gt; and has an embedded &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; included. Its code is sandboxed allowing you to access variables which are available inside other directives including &lt;a href="https://www.glue.codes/docs-templating-htmlDirectives.html#slot"&gt;slots&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.glue.codes/docs-templating-htmlDirectives.html#listItemPresenter"&gt;list item presenters&lt;/a&gt;. In the script you can assign to &lt;code&gt;props&lt;/code&gt; variable to change props/attributes of the "extended" tag. For a complete list of the directives click &lt;a href="https://www.glue.codes/docs-templating-htmlDirectives.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#whats-next"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What's next?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you shout "this is another self-promotional read", I'll say yeah, this article is indeed about a new tool. But, bear in mind it's made by two developers who want to address the problem differently. And we're not a corporation. I'm trying to share with you a new way where you can use a slightly extended old-fashion HTML to build reactive apps. So if you like the idea of managing local UI state using the extended tags and attribute directives, you may want to read more in our &lt;a href="https://www.glue.codes/docs-templating-htmlDirectives.html"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also join our Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/gluecodesstudio"&gt;forum&lt;/a&gt; for help and support. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Continuous Code Reviews Are The Way To Go</title>
      <author>Marcelo Sousa</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Jun 2021 17:54:55 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/reviewpad/continuous-code-reviews-are-the-way-to-go-190</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/reviewpad/continuous-code-reviews-are-the-way-to-go-190</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the major roadblocks for quality code reviews is how their complexity can quickly get overwhelming. The three major factors of this increasing complexity are well-known: the number of changes; the maturity of the codebase; the expertise of the reviewer. Of course, you also have time constraints that amplify this complexity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If we don’t figure out techniques and workarounds for these issues, we are hindering the full benefits of code reviews.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We have made it our mission to tackle this complexity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#it-is-all-about-the-process"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  It is all about the process
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent &lt;a href="https://lnkd.in/db7nNuA"&gt;Harvard Business Review article&lt;/a&gt;, David De Cremer and Garry Kasparov write about &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Augmented Intelligence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and how the synergy between artificial intelligence and human intelligence can lead us to new levels of productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weak human + machine + better process was superior to a strong computer alone and, more remarkably, superior to a strong human + machine + inferior process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Garry Kasparov&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key aspect for success is the &lt;strong&gt;process&lt;/strong&gt; by which humans and machines collaborate. This is our philosophy for Reviewpad. So what’s this process for us?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#continuous-code-reviews-are-the-way-to-go"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Continuous code reviews are the way to go
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are stating this &lt;strong&gt;outright&lt;/strong&gt;. We are very much continuous code review evangelists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe it is the practice that best allows us to avoid the single greatest hurdle in code reviews, which is its mounting complexity. In this article, we will explain why. We will also explain what we mean, because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#continuous-can-mean-different-things"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Continuous can mean different things
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Context switching incurs a lot of overhead. (…) In a continuous code review you don’t have this problem. Your pair is right there giving you feedback as you go. From little things like variable naming to bigger things like noticing a bug or telling you about an existing class you should use. The code is updated in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/tech-blog/continuous-code-reviews/"&gt;Allan Stuart on Continuous Code Reviews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His solution implies two developers working on the same code at the same time. One of them actually creating original code, and the other reviewing live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is possibly as close to &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; continuous as you can possibly get, but it’s not the only way to achieve this effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not every company can assign two developers to the same job at any given time. Also, not every company has a pair like &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/12/10/the-friendship-that-made-google-huge"&gt;Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat&lt;/a&gt;. And the truth is, we are still understanding how pair or mob programming is adapting to remote environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reviewpad is being designed to provide the same sort of &lt;strong&gt;collaborative and continuous mindset&lt;/strong&gt; without this multiplication of effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analyses it provides address the aspects where people are more error-prone. &lt;strong&gt;It’s a tool that augments human intelligence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe in &lt;strong&gt;breaking things up into tiny parts.&lt;/strong&gt; We also know that you don’t need pull requests to achieve that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#our-process-code-review-centric-development"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Our process: code review centric development
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a well-known practice in software development to separate work into sprints and do daily syncs. In these daily syncs, you have a &lt;em&gt;squad&lt;/em&gt;, which typically includes developers, designers, and a product owner. Someone puts up a board of issues from Jira (or some other project management tool) and the entire team goes over it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miscommunication between the description of a Jira task and the description of a pull request happens all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We propose an &lt;strong&gt;inversion of control&lt;/strong&gt;. After a written high-level specification is shared with a developer, it is up to them to specify the intent of a particular changeset for development. The product owner must then understand what fraction of the high-level task these changes amount to, and adjust if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this preferable? It significantly reduces &lt;strong&gt;specification overhead&lt;/strong&gt; by product owners who do not have (or don’t have the time to acquire) a good understanding of the codebase. It also reduces artificial pressure on development by reducing the guesswork regarding the completion of a task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#reviewing-ideas-will-save-you-ages"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Reviewing ideas will save you ages
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of it as architecture. You’re building a castle. When do you bring in someone to check your work? &lt;strong&gt;When the castle’s already built may be a tad too late&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea that code reviews should only be about fixing mistakes is misguided. Code reviews should be about creating better, more efficient, code. &lt;strong&gt;If an idea is misguided, or flawed, then it hardly matters whether the code brings it to life perfectly&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reviewers should be a part of the process from the get-go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code reviews&lt;/strong&gt; are the central piece of this approach and that’s why we call it &lt;strong&gt;code review centric&lt;/strong&gt; development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-does-it-work"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How does it work?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as a developer plans to change something in the codebase, the first step is to open a code review stating the intent of the changes and assigning reviewers. This signals to the rest of the team what this person is working on and how we can help them achieve success &lt;strong&gt;continuously&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the benefits we have experienced in the past months are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;reduced miscommunication&lt;/strong&gt;, because we are asking early technical and non-technical questions about the approach;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;faster development,&lt;/strong&gt; because we are regularly checking changes to see the progress;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;more shared knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;, because of more frequent and better feedback;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;fewer integration problems&lt;/strong&gt;, becausewe detect potential future conflicts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reviewpad was built to facilitate this type of development. Instead of forcing developers to look at a kanban of issues (which relate to the product owner, but not them), we use a dashboard of code reviews to easily communicate &lt;strong&gt;real&lt;/strong&gt; progress and potential pain points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The length of the review is as long as the developer &lt;strong&gt;wants it to be&lt;/strong&gt;, since feedback is given on a continuous basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of forcing developers to switch between contexts a dozen times to complete a code review, you can do reviews that are quicker, more focused, and kinder to your brain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#draft-pullmerge-requests-are-an-excellent-starting-point"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Draft Pull/Merge Requests are an excellent starting point
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--E9ac_6IR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/na2fc8m56u0h01fvtnx6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--E9ac_6IR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/na2fc8m56u0h01fvtnx6.png" alt="GitHub's draft pull requests"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The adoption of code review-centric development is going to take time. This is why Reviewpad seamlessly integrates with GitHub and GitLab. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An excellent starting point  to this approach is to use WIP or &lt;a href="https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/"&gt;draft pull requests&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feature allows you to create a draft of your pull request before you make any changes at all. And you can immediately assign a reviewer. &lt;strong&gt;Ideally, more than one.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do this diligently (and we recommend making at least two checkpoints in your draft PR a day), any reviewer who is available will be able to come in whenever they’re notified of changes, and provide you with more feedback. This way, you and your team can start feeling the benefits of continuous, iterative code reviews. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reviewpad’s integration of the code host draft pull/merge requests, alongside its sophisticated communications arsenal means that it’s possible and easy to start the review process earlier. In the &lt;strong&gt;brilliant idea&lt;/strong&gt; stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recommend that developers draft every pull request they do as soon as they think it up. &lt;strong&gt;Before they even touch the code&lt;/strong&gt;. Again: If you clearly signal your code changes before they are even made, a reviewer will not only know what they’re looking for, they’ll be able to comment on your intention as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#async-yet-continuous"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Async, yet continuous
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you take this iterative approach and take full advantage of the draft PRs, your reviewer doesn’t need to be working the code at the same time as you. They will be notified as soon as you have your idea, and they will be able to provide feedback on it much earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, you need to help them! They will only be able to understand changes that much &lt;strong&gt;quicker&lt;/strong&gt; if your intent is laid out clearly. If they know what they’re looking at, they will have an &lt;strong&gt;easier&lt;/strong&gt; time spotting mistakes, or code that quite simply doesn’t do what it’s supposed to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This back and forth between a developer and a reviewer is the perfect way to go about it. It’s async, yet continuous. We’re working on the right set of features to make this process easy and enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If reviews are done this way, then they will effectively keep up with development. Over time, your codebase will &lt;strong&gt;never build up unreviewed&lt;/strong&gt;, regardless of how mature it is. Conversations between developers and product owners will feel more natural and transparent. In the long-term, your team will have the right mechanisms to re-enforce trust and ownership – and when that happens, you have coding superpowers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reactjs: Building forms</title>
      <author>Jucian0</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Jun 2021 17:32:38 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/jucian0/reactjs-building-forms-236m</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/jucian0/reactjs-building-forms-236m</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you really need a form library to build forms in React?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello friends, today I will talk to you about forms in React, and tell you how my first experience building form in React was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My relationship with React when I created forms was a love-hate relationship, because React doesn't tell you how everything should work. Another reason was that Angular has a powerful solution to build forms (yeah, I've worked with Angular before), and honestly, I never found anything as good as reactive forms in React ecosystem. But everything changed when the React team introduced Hooks API, after that the process to create forms became very simple, and I started to think if it was really necessary to use a form library to implement forms in React.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I will show you an easy way to build forms without any form library, and at the end of this post you will decide if it's really necessary to use a form library, however, regardless of your opinion, I hope that you learn something in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the first example of how to implement a form without a form library. In this example, I will explore an effective way to create an advanced components form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#basic-requirements"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Basic requirements?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To perform this tutorial you will need to have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic knowledge of Javascript.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic knowledge of React.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NodeJS in your environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I will use Yarn, feel free to use NPM, I usually use Typescript, but I will write the code with Javascript since Typescript user is familiar with Javascript too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#first-steps"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  First steps
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start we need to initiate a React application with the command:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx create-react-app react-form
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;react-form
yarn
yarn start
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are creating an application, opening the application directory, installing dependencies, and starting the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Form libraries can be optional, but if you want good validation in your forms you should use a library form validation. For this tutorial I will use Yup, since that our goal is to learn how to implement good forms, I will use Bootstrap to work more easily.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn add bootstrap
yarn add yup
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The create-react-app creates some files that we will not use for this tutorial, for this reason, I will remove them, so the files structures are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qen87E5Z--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rDtSgnqF--/c_limit%252Cf_auto%252Cfl_progressive%252Cq_auto%252Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1%252AP8fTwj1DIETEFG6BlOf5iA.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qen87E5Z--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rDtSgnqF--/c_limit%252Cf_auto%252Cfl_progressive%252Cq_auto%252Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1%252AP8fTwj1DIETEFG6BlOf5iA.png" alt="files structure"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#indexcss"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  index.css
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;@import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sx"&gt;url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,700&amp;amp;display=swap")&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;@import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;"./../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#appjs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  App.js
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#indexjs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  index.js
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ReactDOM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react-dom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./index.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ReactDOM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#forms-with-controlled-input"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Forms with controlled input
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forms with controlled inputs are the most common example included in libraries. In this approach, every time that the input value is changed the component is rendered again, so we save the input value in a specific state:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setInput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"input"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;onChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setInput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I will create a folder for every component, this way the files should have the name &lt;code&gt;index.jsx&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this form I will create a component in &lt;code&gt;Components/FormControlled/Input&lt;/code&gt;, this component will be responsible to show a label, an input, and in case of error, a span with an error message. In this component we should validate whether the input was touched or not, it's helpful to show error messages.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ChangeEvent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;rest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;touched&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTouched&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;htmlFor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;rest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"form-control"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;rest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;onBlur&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTouched&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"text-danger"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;touched&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The principal component will be &lt;code&gt;Components/FormControlled&lt;/code&gt;, this is the component where we will build our form, so let's implement it:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./Input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;initialFormState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="na"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="na"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;

   &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setForm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;initialFormState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

   &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setInput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;inputName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;newValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;inputName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setForm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;({...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;newValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}))&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

   &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Form Controlled&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
               &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"form-group"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Input&lt;/span&gt;
                     &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"name"&lt;/span&gt;
                     &lt;span class="na"&gt;onChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setInput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
                     &lt;span class="na"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Name"&lt;/span&gt;
                     &lt;span class="na"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
               &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
               &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"form-group"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Input&lt;/span&gt;
                     &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"email"&lt;/span&gt;
                     &lt;span class="na"&gt;onChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setInput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
                     &lt;span class="na"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"E-mail"&lt;/span&gt;
                     &lt;span class="na"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
               &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
               &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"form-group"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Input&lt;/span&gt;
                     &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"password"&lt;/span&gt;
                     &lt;span class="na"&gt;onChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setInput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
                     &lt;span class="na"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Password"&lt;/span&gt;
                     &lt;span class="na"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
               &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

               &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"form-group"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"button"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"btn btn-primary"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Submit&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
               &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;UserForm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-happening-here"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is happening here?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm creating a state for our form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a function called &lt;code&gt;setInput&lt;/code&gt; that receives the input name and return another function that receives the input change event, you can find more information about that &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures"&gt;Closures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After that, I just return the template of component with the Input component. I just need to pass the field name in &lt;code&gt;setInput&lt;/code&gt; because this function will return a function that receives input change event as argument, and the second function know the context of the first function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to have the application working, we need to make some changes in &lt;code&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;FormControlled&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./Components/FormControlled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"container-fluid"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"row"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"col-lg-6 col-md-6"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;FormControlled&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn start
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#adding-field-validations"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Adding field validations
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, we will use Yup to create input validations, I believe that this is the best option to create validations because this package gives us a great number of resources which saves us time in having to write them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, I'm creating an object with the same structure as our form state, and adding some roles that should be applied, after that I add the message errors.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;yup&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;yup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;FormValidations&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;yup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;yup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;required&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Name is required&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;yup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;E-mail is invalid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;required&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;E-mail is required&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;yup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;min&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Minimum 8 chars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Max 20 chars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's back to the &lt;code&gt;Components/FormControlled&lt;/code&gt; and add this validation in our form.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/*...................*/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;FormValidations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;./index.validations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useValidation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;./../../hooks/useValidation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

 &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/*...................*/&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/*...................*/&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setErrors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({})&lt;/span&gt;

   &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;validate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;formValidations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;validate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;abortEarly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setErrors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({})&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;instanceof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ValidationError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;inner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
               &lt;span class="nx"&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setErrors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

   &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;validate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()},[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;

   &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Form Controlled&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
               &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"form-group"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Input&lt;/span&gt;
                     &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/*...................*/&lt;/span&gt;
                     &lt;span class="na"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
               &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

                  &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Input&lt;/span&gt;
                     &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/*...................*/&lt;/span&gt;
                     &lt;span class="na"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
               &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
               &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"form-group"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Input&lt;/span&gt;
                     &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/*...................*/&lt;/span&gt;
                     &lt;span class="na"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
               &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

               &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"form-group"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"button"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"btn btn-primary"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Submit&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
               &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;UserForm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lets-look-at-some-changes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Let's look at some changes
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added news state to save errors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a function named validate, this function should receive the form values and pass this value to object validation written in the last step. If the form state has a valid value, we set an empty object in the errors state, but if it has any error, we need to know if is an error of validation (ValidationError instance), before setting them in the errors state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To update the errors every time that form is changed, we pass form state as a dependency in the useEffect hook.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added object error with the specific property in every field. If you run the application again you will see the form working well with validation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Improving our solution.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that we can improve our code, we can split some parts of our code and create a new hook to make the code more understandable and cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-a-hook-usevalidation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating a hook useValidation
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, I will create a folder called Hooks in the root of application &lt;code&gt;Hooks/useValidation&lt;/code&gt;, inside the folder I will create a file called &lt;code&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt;. Inside this file, we just need to put part of our code, validate function, &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; hook, and the error state. Finally, we return an object with the error state.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ValidationError&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;yup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useValidation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;values&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;schema&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setErrors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({});&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;validate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;schema&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;validate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;values&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;abortEarly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setErrors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;instanceof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ValidationError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{};&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;inner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setErrors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;validate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;values&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useValidation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#improving-form-component"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Improving form component
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just need to remove the code that was added in &lt;code&gt;useValidation&lt;/code&gt; hook, and import the new hook.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./Input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;FormValidations&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./index.validations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useValidation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./../../hooks/useValidation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;initialFormState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="na"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;UserForm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useValidation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;FormValidations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"form-group"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"button"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"btn btn-primary"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            Submit
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;UserForm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#advantages"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Advantages
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's is simple code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Validation with every change give us a better experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#disadvantages"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Disadvantages
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This isn't the better approach if you want better performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The component is rendered again every time that the state is changed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at the complete code in github: &lt;a href="https://github.com/Jucian0/react-form-controlled"&gt;https://github.com/Jucian0/react-form-controlled&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next post I will show you how to improve this code to make it perform better.&lt;/p&gt;
