      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-uniswap"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Uniswap?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uniswap is a decentralized business protocol that’s used to exchange cryptocurrencies. It is also the name of the company based on the Uniswap protocol.&lt;br&gt;
Uniswap was created by Hayden Adams. Its initial version was published to the Ethereum main net on November 2, 2018. Uniswap makes multiple crypto assets, including its native UNI cryptocurrency, to afford a service similar to an old-style exchange. The difference is, Uniswap has no one central operator or manager, making it fully decentralized.&lt;br&gt;
Uniswap unlike most exchanges, which are designed to take fees, is planned to function as a public good — a tool for the community to trade tokens without middlemen. Also, different most exchanges, which match buyers and sellers to determine prices and execute trades, Uniswap uses a simple math equation, pools of tokens and Ethereum to do the same job. That’s why the companies are interested to get &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://radindev.com/uniswap-clone-script/"&gt;Uniswap clone script&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yuO_j9Xo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7x6x99muqtdx8zeqetpd.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yuO_j9Xo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7x6x99muqtdx8zeqetpd.jpeg" alt="uniswap statistics"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Since Uniswap is built on Ethereum, it cannot list tokens built on other blockchains, and so users can only swap ERC-20 tokens.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZtX0hQX9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n4u4pvyrrxz98zxnolk5.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZtX0hQX9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n4u4pvyrrxz98zxnolk5.jpeg" alt="uniswap statistics"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-does-it-work"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How does it work?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uniswap’s network is designed to facilitate the buying and selling of crypto assets in a way that mirrors a traditional exchange. &lt;br&gt;
It does this by using smart contracts, which allow users (called liquidity providers) to deposit crypto assets into pools. These smart contracts then allow other users (called traders) to buy and sell these assets. Users who trade these pool assets pay a fee that is then distributed to all the liquidity providers proportionally (based on their contribution to the pool).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#uniswap-clone-script"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Uniswap Clone Script
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uniswap clone script is a decentralized exchange (DEX) script that performs two smart contracts presented on the topmost of Ethereum (ETH) blockchain.&lt;br&gt;
Uniswap exchange clone script is developed in a way that resolves common liquidity problems faced by every exchange. It permits automatic token swapping for performing decentralized exchanges (DEX) in DeFi platforms. Uniswap Clone Script is a multi-tested, readymade decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol script built on Ethereum Blockchain used to start a decentralized platform for automated liquidity providing on Ethereum (ETH) that operates 100% similar to Uniswap. The Uniswap Clone Script supports both swapping &amp;amp; liquidity provisions of Ethereum and its tokens.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/carlosespada/html-tags-s-acd</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is used to &lt;strong&gt;indicate a text that is no longer correct, accurate or relevant&lt;/strong&gt;, and that is usually rendered with a line through it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is not suitable for indicating edits in a document&lt;/strong&gt;, that's what the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;del&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ins&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements exist for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presence of the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;s&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element is not advertised in most screen readers with the default settings. You can force your ad using the &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; property of CSS as well as the &lt;code&gt;::before&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;::after&lt;/code&gt; pseudo-elements as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;s::before,
s::after {
  clip-path: inset(100%);
  clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);
  height: 1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  position: absolute;
  white-space: nowrap;
  width: 1px;
}

s::before {
  content: " [start of stricken text] ";
}

s::after {
  content: " [end of stricken text] ";
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some screen reader users disable content ad to avoid excessive verbosity. So it is important not to abuse this technique, &lt;a href="https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/be-careful-with-strikethrough"&gt;avoiding using it whenever possible&lt;/a&gt;, except in situations where not knowing that there is a crossed-out content can adversely affect the understanding of the text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type: &lt;em&gt;inline&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-closing: &lt;em&gt;No&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Semantic value: &lt;em&gt;No&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_s.asp"&gt;Definition&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_s"&gt;Example&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-html_elements_s"&gt;Support&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yes, each one of us developer is the example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you know, being a developer is about never stop learning, with that comes a mentoring role as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what stage you are at in your development life, you should opt to mentor people wherever you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-being-a-mentor-is-important"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why being a mentor is important
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons why it's important to being a mentor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge transfer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ofcourse in its most basic form its a way to transfer knowledge to your peers. Making them gain knowledge, but also making working with them easier.&lt;br&gt;
Think about helping them understand git in the right way or how to proper evaluate PR's this will all help you as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grow yourself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mentoring people will also help you grow, in a sense of honing your management skills. But also as a people person it's a super good way to connect to people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thinking out loud&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a big reason for me is that it is a way to think out loud, this process can help you even deeper understand solutions to problems.&lt;br&gt;
You might already know that the answer is {x}, but do you really know how you even got to that?&lt;br&gt;
Explaining it to someone can really help you grasp the concept even better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-do-we-set-the-example"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How do we set the example?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to setting the example, I'm a firm believer of treating people the way you like to be treated.&lt;br&gt;
If you want people to handle PR's in a certain way, give that example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want someone to explain code in a certain way, set that example by doing it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to set the example is by communicating on how you see certain things.&lt;br&gt;
Especially when you work in a team it's important you all think the same about certain aspect of the software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn't mean one way of doing it is wrong of right, but it helps if you talk about these standards at least come to terms within the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#benefits-of-setting-examples"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Benefits of setting examples
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of benefits of setting examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better workplace relationships&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By being and setting the example, you will create a super open and growing workplace. Your colleagues will be more part of the team and this is always a win for team building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More productivity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By learning from each others as developers we create more productivity, this might not just be because we grasp the concepts better. But also think about more fun doing the job, or learn about tooling to help us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clear goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sets clear goals for yourself, but also for your growth as a developer and the rest of your team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you see these all work up growth, personal growth as well as team and company goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you are already being the best example you can be, if not this surely inspired you to be the best example.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-open-source"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Open Source?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open source is a commonly used term for the code which is publically accessible and people can see, edit, and share the data. In open-source projects, developers from all around the world can contribute to the project and make it better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#benefits-of-open-source"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Benefits of Open Source
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower cost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher quality software and code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secure as code is public&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Faster development &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cons-of-open-source"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cons of Open Source
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Needs maintenance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hidden costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User friendly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#getting-started"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Getting Started
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#getting-started-with-open-source-as-a-maintainer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Getting started with open source as a maintainer
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get started with open source as a maintainer, you need to do the following steps&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add it as a public repo to GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add some docs on what it is and how to contribute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a license to your repo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add some issues in the issues section (if you have any)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let everyone know about it (if no one knows about it then no one will be able to contribute :P)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#getting-started-as-a-contributor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Getting started as a contributor
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a repo you want to contribute to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the features or bug fixes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a pull request&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wait for your code to be merged&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main trouble for every beginner while starting to contribute is finding repositories.&lt;br&gt;
So here are some useful articles-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.greenroots.info/8-resources-to-start-with-opensource-immediately"&gt;8 resources to start with opensource immediately&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://catalins.tech/find-open-source-projects-to-contribute-as-a-beginner"&gt;Find Open Source Projects To Contribute As A Beginner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://vinitshahdeo.dev/beginner-friendly-issues-for-hacktoberfest-2021"&gt;A curated list of beginner-friendly issues for Hacktoberfest 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were ever thinking of contributing to open source, now is the perfect time to start 😉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Useful links&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://opensource.org/"&gt;Open Source Initiative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Random Joke Fetching in React</title>
      <author>SnowBit</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 05:45:22 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/snowbit/random-joke-fetching-in-react-1ean</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#hello-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Hello 👋,
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, you will learn to &lt;strong&gt;fetch random joke from a node module in React JS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's get started,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-react-app"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Create React App
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx create-react-app joke-boi&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#install-this-node-module"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Install this node module
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm i one-liner-joke&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#now-create-appjs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Now create &lt;strong&gt;App.js&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Joke&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;./Joke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Joke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#now-well-create-a-component-called-joke-in-jokejs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Now we'll create a component called Joke in &lt;strong&gt;Joke.js&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;./Joke.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;react-bootstrap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;oneLinerJoke&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;one-liner-joke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Joke&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;componentDidMount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleGet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

     &lt;span class="nx"&gt;componentWillUnmount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; 
       &lt;span class="nb"&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;removeEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleGet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
     &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleGet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getRandomJoke&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;oneLinerJoke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getRandomJoke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;joke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerText&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getRandomJoke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* &amp;lt;input type="text" className="form-control" id="joke" disabled/&amp;gt;                 */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

                    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;joke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;refreshing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;you&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;can&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;t find the joke. Note: It is not a joke&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;hr /&amp;gt;
                       &amp;lt;button className="btn btn-info nextBtn" onClick={this.handleGet}&amp;gt;Don&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;click&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;here&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;joke&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;😑&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;                    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Card.Body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;                &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;            &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Joke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#and-all-set-now-you-can-run-in-console"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  And all set! now you can run in console
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm start&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#check-out-github-repository-and-fork"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/dev_shubham/array-map-method-in-javascript-2fi</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, guys today we are covering one of the most important topic.&lt;br&gt;
 Today we are learning map() method, so let's start today's article. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉 Article Content&lt;br&gt;
• What is Array.map() method ?&lt;br&gt;
• Syntax of Array.map() method ?&lt;br&gt;
• Use of Array.map() method ? &lt;br&gt;
• Example of Array.map() method ?&lt;br&gt;
• Explanation of example&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉 What is Array.map() method ? &lt;br&gt;
=&amp;gt; The map() method is used for array transformation. It takes another custom function as an argument and on each array item applies that function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉 Syntax of Array.map() method ? &lt;br&gt;
=&amp;gt; &lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qeYHpXSk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6q2xsuvzs1krsfhscqko.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qeYHpXSk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6q2xsuvzs1krsfhscqko.jpg" alt="syntax "&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉 Use of Array.map() method ?&lt;br&gt;
=&amp;gt; Map() method used to iterate over an all array item one by one and apply function on each array items. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉 Example of Array.map() method &lt;br&gt;
=&amp;gt; See following image &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BcYqvgBS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kaafkhqh861uc06l309t.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BcYqvgBS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kaafkhqh861uc06l309t.jpg" alt="Example"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉 Explanation &lt;br&gt;
=&amp;gt; As shown above image we need an array with some values. That's why I am created an array and it's name is 'arr' and stored [1,2,3,4,5] this values. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I am using map() method to increase every array item by one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used map() method and pass a function and this function takes one argument and this argument hold all the array items. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When this method call all array items iterate one by one and apply function. When array item '1' is pass through a map() method it's simply increment by 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉 Map() method take a function which will be arrows function or normal Js function. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉 This method works like a loop and it's similar to for and forEach. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🙏 Thank you for reading.... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Let's go!🚀
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-when-you-are-ready-for-a-hackathon"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. When you are ready for a hackathon?
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are always ready for a hackathon until and unless you want to learn new skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-how-can-you-win-a-hackathon"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. How can you win a hackathon?🥉
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've experienced multiple hackathons for different organizations. I can answer that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;first and foremost,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Idea - you must have something unique and creative with your project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implementation - If your project has some real-life use or if it can be implemented in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;UI/UX - yes, the UI should be as good as the Idea of your project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tech stack - sometimes the tech stack you are using in your project can impress the judges. 😉&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-what-else-you-should-know-apart-from-coding"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. What else you should know apart from coding?🤔
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must have good writing skills, your words should be on 'point' (doesn't mean lengthy words). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll need good writing skills to make PPT &amp;amp; Readme of your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-benefits-of-hackathon"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Benefits of Hackathon?✨
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course SWAGS! , you'll get amazing prizes, swags, and certificates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You'll work in a team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most importantly, You'll earn some good friends and grow in the community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tips"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tips:
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Showcase your project to a Mentor before submission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Happy hacking!👩‍💻&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Which CSS framework should you use?</title>
      <author>Abhiraj Bhowmick</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 05:00:56 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/abhirajb/which-css-framework-should-you-use-2ea7</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/abhirajb/which-css-framework-should-you-use-2ea7</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Responsive CSS frameworks take a lot of work and persistence to build and create when building CSS on HTML responsiveness, accessibility, and structure. This is why CSS frameworks were created, to take the stress off of you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A CSS framework is a software framework created to allow for easier, more standards-compliant web design using HTML/CSS. Many popular CSS frameworks are design-oriented and contain elements that can be re-used in the creation of any website or app, as well as a grid system designed to provide a responsive CSS layout to webpages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the frameworks listed in this article are free and open source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-bootstrap"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. &lt;a href="https://getbootstrap.com/"&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a doubt, Bootstrap is the most widely used free and open source CSS framework. Created in 2011 by developers Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton, Bootstrap is now used by millions of websites.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Tyt7O8qB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5poa6t34yby6duk3j6jq.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Tyt7O8qB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5poa6t34yby6duk3j6jq.png" alt="bootstrap"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Bootstrap features Sass variables and mixins, a responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components for building layouts, and powerful plugins built on jQuery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-tailwind"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. &lt;a href="https://tailwindcss.com/"&gt;Tailwind&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tailwind is a relatively new CSS framework, designed to be different from its competitors. Instead of predesigned components, Tailwind provides low-level utility classes that let you build your own designs. I personally have used Tailwind in my projects and loved it so far. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--b3f4nWZP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nt3hkvn4r9kxdpzlvd0b.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--b3f4nWZP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nt3hkvn4r9kxdpzlvd0b.png" alt="tailwind"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Let’s have a quick look to some HTML used with Tailwind:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"bg-blue hover:bg-blue-dark text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  Button
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the example is using many utility classes on a button element. Those classes allow you to finely style any element: We can easily spot classes named text-white, font-bold and rounded, defining the visual aspect of the button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-bulma"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. &lt;a href="https://bulma.io/"&gt;Bulma&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 21kB minified and gzipped, Bulma isn’t the most lightweight of this list, but this open source CSS framework is so interesting that it totally deserves a mention. Bulma is built with a mobile-first approach, which makes every element optimized for vertical reading, and its grid system is fully built with Flexbox.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ew8UExze--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5d8q63wyepr0ovnofnmg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ew8UExze--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5d8q63wyepr0ovnofnmg.png" alt="bulma"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Achieving flexible layout with same-size columns is as simple as adding a .column class to any of your HTML elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bulma is also built with Sass, which allows you to only use the features you really need in your web development tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-ui-kit"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. &lt;a href="https://getuikit.com/"&gt;UI Kit&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UIkit is a lightweight and responsive CSS framework for developing fast and powerful web interfaces.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BjTUxwIw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/iz9rjfg2iswrcp9gywbd.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BjTUxwIw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/iz9rjfg2iswrcp9gywbd.png" alt="uikit"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Consisting of compiled CSS and JavaScript, UIKit is easy to use and provides all the needed tools for modern web design: Grid, custom icons, components, animations, and a lot more. UIKit is compatible with Less and Sass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-semantic-ui"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. &lt;a href="https://semantic-ui.com/"&gt;Semantic UI&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This framework stands out in many ways. It has become popular over a short period of time because of its simplicity.  Semantic UI is well customized and IT doesn’t take much to comprehend. It is also easy to learn. This framework is lightweight and beginner-friendly&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lightweight (~10KB gzipped) starting point for your projects, Spectre provides elegantly designed elements, as well as a flexbox-based, responsive and mobile-friendly layout.&lt;br&gt;

Much smaller in size and features than fully-featured frameworks like Bootstrap, Spectre is a great choice for single-page websites and small web applications&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Starter Project - Smart Scss</title>
      <author>psuresh21</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/psuresh21/starter-project-smart-scss-2d0d</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hK9rwonb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/iccugtjn2ym4w1ly6mx4.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hK9rwonb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/iccugtjn2ym4w1ly6mx4.PNG" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-smart-scss-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Smart Scss ?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Smart scss is the best time-saver tool and code written by sass. It's helpful to build quickly - like typography, grid system, colors, etc. It's got unique mixins and functions too. Once you are adapt to smart scss, you will see a good improvement in your web design. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-you-need-smart-scss"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why you need Smart Scss?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#for-example"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  For Example:
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you try to set typography for desktop and mobile, you need to search in a particular site for getting type scale values. It makes your mind very frustrated to identify suitable fonts for particular layouts and look like a back and forth process you feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#that-is-what-smart-scss-comes-in"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  that is what smart scss comes in,
&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;p {
  @include type scale(paragraph,16,5,4);
}

p {
  font-size: 16px;
}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Some of New ES12(ES2021) JavaScript Features.</title>
      <author>EswaraPrakash Vaithiyanathan</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 03:21:15 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/eswaraprakash/some-of-new-es12-es2021-javascript-features-3pmo</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/eswaraprakash/some-of-new-es12-es2021-javascript-features-3pmo</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changes released in ES2021&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The changes released in ES2021 are as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;String.prototype.replaceAll()&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perform string replacement for all applicable parts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Existing replace()methods are valid only for the first part to be replaced, so if you wanted to replace everything you had to use a regular expression&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this method, you can prevent replacement omissions due to regular expression mistakes, and it is easy to understand what you want to do at a glance.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;let str = "I like programming. I like my job."
str.replaceAll ( "like" , "love" ) 
// Output result: "I love programming. I love my job." 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It is not yet supported by TypeScript by default, but you can  use it by changing the setting in tsconfig.json as follows. (Other changes to ES2021 will also be available)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{ "compilerOptions" : { "lib" : [ "ES2021" ],    }, }

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promise.any()&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When any one of the promises running at the same time is processed resolved, that promise will be returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If all promises are reject, then AggregateError(the type when one operation needs to return multiple errors) is returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to know that the process was successful but you don't need to know which one, using any seems to be useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is also not yet supported by default in TypeScript. tsconfig.json It can be used by changing the settings as described above .&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Promise .any ([ new Promise ( ( resolve, reject ) =&amp;gt; 
setTimeout (reject, 100 , '1st' )), 
new Promise (( resolve, reject ) =&amp;gt; setTimeout (resolve, 200, '2nd')) ]) 
.then ( value =&amp;gt; console .log ( `first completed process: $ {value} `)) 
.catch (err =&amp;gt; console .log (err))
// Output result 
// First completed process: 2nd 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WeakRefs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Makes the following feasible:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating a "weak reference" to an object&lt;br&gt;
User-defined finalizer execution after objects are garbage collected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A "weak reference" is a reference to an object that does not interfere with the execution of garbage collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally, when an object is created, it is kept in memory (a "strong reference"), but a "weak reference" is subject to garbage collection collection when memory needs to be freed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you use these two well, you can prevent memory leaks of data that is no longer referenced, such as deleted objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the functionality of garbage collection is complex (when and how garbage collection occurs depends on the implementation of the JavaScript engine you are using ) and should be carefully considered for proper use. Officially, there is a note that it is better to avoid using it if possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't mentioned in the official TypeScript documentation, but according to this issue , it's available in version 4.1 and later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tried to execute the following code in PlayGround, but it was certainly able to compile with 4.1 or later version.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const obj = new  Map (); 
const cache = new WeakRef (obj); 
// Output result 
// v4.0.5 
// Cannot find name'WeakRef'. 
// v4.1.5 
// None
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logical Assignment Operators&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You will be able to write as follows&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No extra branching is required when entering the initial value, and the implementation is refreshing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Available from version 4.0 on TypeScript&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;// a || (a = b);
 a || = b;

// a &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (a = b);
 a &amp;amp;&amp;amp; = b;

// a ?? (a = b);
 a ?? = b;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Numeric separators&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;_Can be inserted between the numbers. (Even if you enter it, it will be recognized as a numerical value)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is possible with all numeric literals, not just decimal numbers. This makes the numbers easier to read&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Available from version 2.7 in TypeScript.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;1_000_000_000            // 1.0101_475_938.38 // 
1.01           million, decimal point can also be used
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
