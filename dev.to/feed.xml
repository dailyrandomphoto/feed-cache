      <title>Faster! Optimizing React app to the bone</title>
      <author>Štěpán Granát</author>

      <link>https://dev.to/tolgee_i18n/faster-optimizing-react-app-to-the-bone-21kc</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/tolgee_i18n/faster-optimizing-react-app-to-the-bone-21kc</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Tolgee platform, we manage translations. So our most important view is a list of translations, every row contains key and related translations in different languages. As this view serves multiple purposes, we have quite a lot of requirements and fulfilling all of them required quite a bit of optimizations, which I'd like to share with you today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-are-we-dealing-with"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What are we dealing with
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mainly, a whole view is using infinite scrolling, where we automatically fetch additional data when user scrolls down. Every row needs to have some buttons, so he can edit, select or modify state of translations. We have search and filters, which should work swiftly when applied. Then we have resible columns, which allow user to change whole layout by mouse dragging. We also need to detect overflowing text vertically, which can't be done simply through css, but we need to "test render" it first and then see if it fits. And last but not least (as new features will surely come in the future), everything need to work with focus, so user can controll it through keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-identify-problems-generally"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to identify problems generally
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically always when your React application is slow it's due to too many components re-rendering or too often. React have very useful Developer Tools, where you can profile your App and then find out which components are taking most of the time to render.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I identified slow components, I needed to understand why exactly is rendering so slow.&lt;br&gt;
One might think that if we keep our components small, the amount of rendering should be managable, but as it turned out this was not the case. Main problem is that components often depend on one another (like parent and child or using same data) and when small change in your state causes a big chunk of your app to re-render, you might have to apply additional optimizations, which React doesn't make automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make sure that my optimizations are actually working I've brought my super old laptop to work, which I've considered the most reliable benchmark of improvement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#one-problem-at-a-time"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  One problem at a time
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will now try to ilustrate different situations on the example of our app and offer a way which we choosed as a solution. It is important to understand what exactly is happening, because optimizations are often tradeoffs - you exchange comfort (elegance/convenience/generality) for speed. So if you do incorrect optimizations, you might improve nothing and only ruin your code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#optimizing-state-management"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Optimizing state management
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we simply use Context API for our main state, we end up re-rendering almost entire view on every change. This issue is mostly visible when we use search field, as typing will become unbearably slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--09glPmyq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/051445jqbg09ql6g0n0j.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--09glPmyq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/051445jqbg09ql6g0n0j.gif" alt="Slow typing" width="640" height="302"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can solve this by using some state management tool (e.g. Redux, MobX, ...), or you can use context in a clever way, so you minimize re-rendering (check my previous &lt;a href="https://dev.to/tolgee_i18n/react-doesnt-need-state-management-tool-i-said-31l4"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#large-number-of-children-rerender"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Large number of children re-render
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clever state management still won't protect us completely against unnecessary re-renders. In some cases the fact the Component update causes all children re-render can be too expensive. You can avoid this by wrapping each child with &lt;code&gt;React.memo&lt;/code&gt; - React will then render child only when props change. However, make sure that you fully understand how it works in the &lt;a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactmemo"&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt;, and then check that it really helped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our case we wrap each row in the list with &lt;code&gt;React.memo&lt;/code&gt;. Because the row is relying mostly on fetched data, we can save quite a lot of unnecessary re-rendering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#infinite-scolling"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Infinite scolling
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our main problem now is that our page can have bascially infinite number of components. A way to solve this is to only render elements, that are currently visible to the user. It's better to use some third party solution for this, because it's quite complicated to do right. After some trial and error we ended up with library &lt;code&gt;react-list&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Libraries like these usually require you to specify size of the components upfront (as they need to calculate a full length of the scrollable area without actually rendering the content), which can be quite problematic - in our case row sizes are variable and so we can't really tell how big it will be untill we render it. &lt;code&gt;react-list&lt;/code&gt; is able to solve this by only asking you to estimate the size of rows and then when it actually renders the element, it updates the size automatically. This can lead to your scrollbar jumping (as a height of the container is changing while you are scrolling in it), but if your estimation is somehow decent, it is pretty minor issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice! So now we decreased an overall number of components displayed from infinity to "it depends on your screen size". However we have another problem ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SjsdeIou--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fu1p2sib6j2uuk58wjui.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SjsdeIou--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fu1p2sib6j2uuk58wjui.gif" alt="Slow scrolling" width="640" height="302"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#reducing-rows-complexity"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Reducing rows complexity
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our infinite scrolling optimization wasn't without tradeoff. It takes siginificant time to render each row and because user can scroll quite fast, it can lead to content not keeping up with scrolling. Problem that is related to this is our resizeble layout which is also very slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xc3BkLIF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8nbcf6qhxs0xqxub2kx8.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xc3BkLIF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8nbcf6qhxs0xqxub2kx8.gif" alt="Slow resizing" width="640" height="302"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is quite difficult problem, because only thing that you can do here is to reduce complexity of individual rows. In our case we've mostly solved it by clever usage of css &lt;code&gt;grid&lt;/code&gt;, which allowed us create complex layouts using only few html elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing was to prevent displaying unnecessary stuff on first render. All our buttons are hidden by default and only appear when you hover the given row. We were doing this only by css, which doesn't help React at all. So my solution was to hide the buttons for real (not render them) and show them only &lt;code&gt;onmouseover&lt;/code&gt;, which improved situation quite significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This solution brought a new problem, that you were not able to use focus with &lt;code&gt;tab&lt;/code&gt;, as buttons were not actually present. I've solved this by always rendering first and last button (but hiding them with css) and other buttons would render when focus is within the row itself or when mouseover - this way user won't recognize the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was quite scared when I realized that our Application is becoming very slow and at the end I've spend one full week with these optimizations, but after some trial and error I've understood weak points and was able to target them. Considering the complexity it works fine even on my super old university laptop and I've learned a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm now happy developer and I spend quite a lot of my working time just scrolling around in our App.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SItArf_B--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/y2f23t3aws9kliso4hda.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SItArf_B--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/y2f23t3aws9kliso4hda.gif" alt="Fast scrolling" width="640" height="326"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>🚀 A powerful drag and drop implementation in just 16 lines of JavaScript</title>
      <author>Siddharth</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Nov 2021 06:44:02 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/siddharthshyniben/a-powerful-drag-and-drop-implementation-in-just-16-lines-of-javascript-d5d</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/siddharthshyniben/a-powerful-drag-and-drop-implementation-in-just-16-lines-of-javascript-d5d</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Drag and drop is a very useful tool in applications as it can simplify a large part of the process for users. It's also a common task we delegate to other libraries which may bloat your app when you just need &lt;em&gt;a very simple implementation&lt;/em&gt; when you can use the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API"&gt;Drag and Drop Web API&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Today, I'll show you how you can do just that!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-we-are-making"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What we are making
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the basic implementation we are aiming to build:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/SiddharthShyniben/embed/OJjePGv?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was made in just 16 lines of JavaScript!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with a few more lines we can add a lot more bonus features! Here's a demo with some more features!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/SiddharthShyniben/embed/xxLNJxj?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Play around with it, you will see that we can&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drop elements only in certain places&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Style the element in which we are dropping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Style the original copy of the dragged element&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(With a little trickery) even style the dragged element!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this with just 30 lines of code!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It works on almost all desktop browsers with partial support all the way back to IE 6(!) which should be enough for this to work, but it doesn't work on some mobile browsers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the up-to-date CanIUse data here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--h5Rn_oW2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://caniuse.bitsofco.de/image/dragndrop.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--h5Rn_oW2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://caniuse.bitsofco.de/image/dragndrop.jpg" alt="Data on support for the drag and drop feature across the major browsers from caniuse.com" width="800" height="366"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dealing with libraries for this very basic functionality has been a pain for me, and to save you the trouble I thought I'd document the process here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#html-structure"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  HTML structure
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#places-to-drag-into"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Places to drag into
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need some drop targets to be able to drag something into them right? We can add these using regular divs:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'drop'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'drop'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'drop'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'drop'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I'll be referring to the places we can drop into as drop targets in this post&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can add as many of them wherever you like, as long as an element has the &lt;code&gt;drop&lt;/code&gt; class we &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; be able to drop into them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also add some basic styles for them to look nice.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;box-sizing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;border-box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;sans-serif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.drop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;220px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;45px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#2563EB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin-bottom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;3px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-element-to-drag"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The element to drag
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an element to be draggable, we need, well, an element! We can place the element in one of the drop targets we made before. This is how it should look like&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'drop'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'drag'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;draggable=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'true'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;ondragstart=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'event.dataTransfer.setData('&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;plain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;',&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;)'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        Drag me!
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'drop'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'drop'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'drop'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notice how we also set the &lt;code&gt;draggable&lt;/code&gt; attribute to true. Every draggable element needs to have the &lt;code&gt;draggable&lt;/code&gt; attribute set for it to be draggable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, not every element can be dragged even if the &lt;code&gt;draggable&lt;/code&gt; attribute is set. We need to explicitly say that the element is draggable by listening to the &lt;code&gt;dragstart&lt;/code&gt; event in the HTML. There we are setting &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; as we don't have any data to share and we are setting the data type &lt;code&gt;text/plain&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can (again) also add some basic styles for them to look nice.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;#drag&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;200px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;25px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;3px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;black&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;white&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;grid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;align-items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;justify-content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Note that as long as an element has the &lt;code&gt;draggable&lt;/code&gt; attribute set to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; and the drop targets have the &lt;code&gt;drop&lt;/code&gt; class, the below code should work everywhere&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-minimal-implementation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The minimal implementation
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our drag and drop to be functional, we just need 3 different event listeners. Everything else is a bonus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we need to store the element we are dragging. We can do this by listening to the &lt;code&gt;dragstart&lt;/code&gt; event.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dragged&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;dragstart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dragged&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whenever an element is dragged, this will store the dragged element in a variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we can listen to drop events so we can drop elements.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;drop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Prevent default behaviour (sometimes opening a link)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;preventDefault&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;drop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dragged&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;parentNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;removeChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dragged&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dragged&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whenever we drop an element, if the element is a drop target (has the &lt;code&gt;drop&lt;/code&gt; class) we will append the dragged element to the drop target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're almost done, but we need to do one more thing to make this work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default, dragging elements does nothing, so to prevent the default behavior we need to call &lt;code&gt;event.preventDefault&lt;/code&gt; whenever we drag over the drop target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is easy to achieve with a oneliner:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;dragover&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;preventDefault&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That's it! In 16 lines we have functional drag and drop!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/SiddharthShyniben/embed/OJjePGv?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a video of it in action:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xp-mspR8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1637759563871/Jbnu70TS1.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xp-mspR8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1637759563871/Jbnu70TS1.gif" alt="Minimal drag and drop" width="663" height="632"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#adding-more-features"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Adding more features
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if this drag and drop &lt;em&gt;works&lt;/em&gt;, it's not very nice. It doesn't seem very "natural". Luckily, in a few lines of code, we can make this drag and drop even better!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#styling-the-original-dragged-element"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Styling the original dragged element
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever we drag an element, the original copy of the element doesn't change its style. It would look better if we could add a different style to these dragged elements, like making them transparent to show that it is being dragged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is very easy to do. Just add the styles in the &lt;code&gt;dragstart&lt;/code&gt; event listener.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;dragstart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;opacity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// add more styles as you like...&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But we also need to reset the style once we finish dragging. We can do that by listening to &lt;code&gt;dragend&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addeventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;dragend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;opacity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#styling-the-drop-targets"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Styling the drop targets
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also style the drop target by listening to the &lt;code&gt;dragenter&lt;/code&gt; event:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;dragenter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;drop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;#2c41cc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once again, we need to reset the styles once we leave the element. We can do that by listening to &lt;code&gt;dragleave&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;dragleave&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;drop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We also need to reset the styles once we drop the event. We can edit the &lt;code&gt;drop&lt;/code&gt; event to achieve this.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;drop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;drop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#styling-the-dragged-copy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Styling the dragged copy
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a bit of trickery, we can style the dragged copy too! Maybe we can rotate the element a bit to make it a bit more natural.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can do this by styling the original copy and immediately undoing those styles in the &lt;code&gt;dragstart&lt;/code&gt; event so that the users don't see it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;dragstart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;rotate(-2deg)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now the dragged copy will appear to be rotated when we are dragging it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You now have a fully functioning drag and drop implementation!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/SiddharthShyniben/embed/xxLNJxj?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a video of it in action:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xqrFnCrf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1637760011123/xOQLondbk.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xqrFnCrf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1637760011123/xOQLondbk.gif" alt="Complete drag and drop.gif" width="663" height="632"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/SiddharthShyniben/cd35cf13929e93b4210ffae72b57f986"&gt;Here's a Gist with all the source code for reference&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took a task for which we very commonly delegate to libraries and implemented it ourselves, with surprisingly little code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this opens your eyes to how much you can do with just vanilla JS. You don't need libraries every time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever tried implementing drag and drop on your own? Share in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Top 10 platforms to get free good quality datasets </title>
      <author>Rajat Thakur</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Nov 2021 06:32:10 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/digitallyrajat/top-10-platforms-to-get-free-good-quality-datasets-2og2</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/digitallyrajat/top-10-platforms-to-get-free-good-quality-datasets-2og2</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If “the data is the new oil” then there is a lot of free oil just waiting to be used. And you can do some pretty interesting things with that data, like finding the answer to the question: Is Buffalo, New York really that cold in the winter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is plenty of free data out there, ready to be used for school projects, market research, or just for fun. Before you go crazy, however, you should be aware of the quality of the data you find. Here are some great sources of free data and some ways to determine their quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these dataset sources have strengths, weaknesses, and specialties. All in all, these are great pieces of equipment and you can spend a lot of your time digging rabbit holes.&lt;br&gt;
But if you want to stay focused and find what you need, it’s important to understand the nuances of each source and use their strengths to your advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Dataset Search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the name suggests, Google Dataset Search is “a dataset search engine,” whose primary audience includes journalists and data researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Dataset Search has the most datasets of any options listed here, with 25 million datasets available when it exited beta in January 2020. As it comes to a Google product, the search function is powerful, but if you have to be really specific, it has plenty of filters to narrow down the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to finding free public datasets, you can’t do much better than Google Dataset Search right now. Keep in mind that the Google Graveyard, which is a phenomenon where Google cancels a service or product on short notice, is a pervasive danger to Google products large and small. It is good to know the other options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kaggle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kaggle is a popular data science competition website that provides free public datasets that you can use to learn more about artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizations use Kaggle to display a prompt and # 40, as cassava leaf disease classification and # 41; and teams from around the world will compete against each other to solve it using algorithms (and win a cash prize).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kaggle is quite prominent in the data science community because it provides a way to test and demonstrate your skills — your performance in the Kaggle competition sometimes shows up in job interviews for AI / ML positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After these competitions, the datasets are made available for use. At the time of writing, Kaggle has a collection of over 68,000 datasets, which he organizes using a system of tagging, usability scores, as well as positive reviews and negative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kaggle has a strong community on their site, with discussion boards within each dataset and within each competition. There are also active communities outside of Kaggle, such as r / kaggle, which share tips and tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is to say that Kaggle is more than just a free dataset distributor; it’s also a way to test your skills as a data scientist. Free datasets are a side benefit that anyone can take advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GitHub is the global standard for collaborative and open-source online code repositories, and many of the projects it hosts have datasets you can use. There is a specific project for public datasets aptly called Awesome Public Datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Kaggle, the datasets available on GitHub are a side benefit of the site’s real purpose. In the case of GitHub, this is primarily a code repository service. This is not a data repository optimized for discovering datasets, so you might need to get a little creative to find what you’re looking for, and it won’t have the same variety as Google or Kaggle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Government Sources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many government agencies make their data freely available online, allowing anyone to download and use public datasets. You can find a wide variety of government data from municipal, state, federal, and international sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These datasets are great for students and those focusing on the environment, the economy, healthcare (a lot of these types of data due to COVID19), or demographics. Keep in mind that these aren’t the most stylish sites of all time — they are mostly focused on function rather than style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FiveThirtyEight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FiveThirtyEight is a data journalism website that occasionally makes its datasets available. Their original focus was sport but has since spread to pop culture, science and (most famous) politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The datasets made available by FiveThirtyEight are highly organized and specific to their journalistic production. Unlike the other options on this list, you’ll likely end up browsing inventory rather than searching. And you might come across some fun and interesting data sets, like 50 years of a World Cup doppelganger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data.world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data.world is a data catalog service that simplifies collaboration on data projects. Most of these projects make their datasets available free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone can use data.world to create a workspace or a project that hosts a dataset. A wide variety of data is available, but it is not easy to navigate. You will need to know what you are looking for to see results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data.world requires login to access their free community plan, which allows you to create your own projects / datasets and provides access to others’ projects / datasets. You will need to pay to access multiple projects, datasets, and repositories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Newsdata.io news datasets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newsdata.io is a news API and they collect worldwide news data on a daily basis and they offer that news data with their news API. They also provide free news datasets and the best is that you can also make a news dataset according to your requirement with the help of Newsdata.io news API in python, which may take longer when you are fetching large sums of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AWS Public Data sets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon makes large datasets available on its Amazon Web Services platform. You can download the data and use it on your computer, or analyze the data in the cloud using EC2 and Hadoop via EMR. You can read more about how the program works here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon has a page that lists all the datasets to browse. You will need an AWS account, although Amazon does provide you with a free level of access for new accounts that will allow you to explore data at no cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia is a free, online, community-edited encyclopedia. Wikipedia contains an astonishing expanse of knowledge, with pages on everything from the Ottoman Wars of the Habsburgs to Leonard Nimoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of Wikipedia’s commitment to the advancement of knowledge, they offer all of their content free of charge and regularly generate dumps of all articles on the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, Wikipedia offers a history of changes and activities, which allows you to follow the evolution of a page on a topic over time and to know who contributes to it. You can find different ways to download the data on the Wikipedia site. You will also find scripts to reformat the data in various ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UCI Machine Learning Repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UCI Machine Learning Repository is one of the oldest sources of datasets on the web. While the datasets are user-supplied and therefore have varying levels of documentation and cleanliness, the vast majority are clean and ready to apply. UCI is a great first stop when looking for interesting datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data can be downloaded directly from the UCI Machine Learning repository, without registration. These datasets tend to be quite small and don’t have a lot of nuance, but they are useful for machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quality data gives you quality work&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free data is great, High-quality free data is better. If you want to do a great job with the data you find, you need to do your due diligence to make sure it’s good quality data by asking a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I trust the data source?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, consider the overall reputation of your data source. Ultimately, datasets are created by humans, and those humans may have specific agendas or biases that can translate into your work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the data sources we have listed here are reliable, but there are several data sources that are not as reliable. The only downside to our listing here is that community-provided collections, such as data.world or GitHub, may vary in quality. If you have doubts about the reputation of your data source, compare it with similar sources on the same topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could the data be Incorrect?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, examine your data set for any inaccuracies. Again, humans create these datasets and humans are not perfect. There may be errors in the data which, using a few quick tips, you can quickly identify and correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First tip: calculate estimates for the minimum and maximum for any of your columns. Check if the values in your dataset are outside of this using the filtering and sorting options, shown here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you have a small data set on used car prices. You would expect the price data to be somewhere between $ 7,000 and $ 20,000 or so. When you filter the price column from low to high, the low price probably shouldn’t be very far from $ 7,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But humans can make mistakes and enter data incorrectly: Instead of $ 11,000.00, someone can type $ 1,100.00 or $ 11.00.00. Another common example is that sometimes people don’t want to provide actual data for things like phone numbers. You can get a lot of 9999999999 or 0000000000 in these columns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, pay attention to the column headings. A field can be titled “% occupied” and the entries can have 0.80 or 80. Both could mean 80% but would show up differently in the final data set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then check for errors. If these are simple and obvious mistakes, correct them. If they are clearly incorrect, remove the entry from the dataset so that they do not collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could the Data Be Unfinished?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very common for a dataset to run out of data. Before you start working with the dataset, it is a good idea to check for null or missing values. If there are a lot of NULL values, the dataset is incomplete and may not be good to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Excel, you can do this by using the COUNTBLANK function, for example, COUNTBLANK (B1: B3) in the following image gives a number of 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too many zero values probably mean an incomplete data set. some null values, but not too many, you can pass and replace null values with 0 using SQL, or you can do it manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to know if the data is skewed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding how your data set is asymmetric will help you choose the right data to analyze. It’s helpful to use visualizations to see how skewed your dataset is, as it’s not always obvious by just looking at the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For numeric columns, use a histogram to see the type of distribution of each column (normal, left, right, uniform, bimodal, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strict recommendations of what to do next based on the dataset, but overall the way it is biased will give a general idea of the quality of the data and suggest which columns to use in the analysis. You can then use this general idea to avoid misrepresenting the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For non-numeric columns, use a frequency table to see how many times a value is displayed. In particular, you might want to check if there is mainly a value present. If so, your analysis may be limited due to the low diversity of values. Again, this is just to give you a general idea of the quality of the data and indicate which relevant columns to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can create these visuals and frequency tables in Excel or Google Sheets using CSV, but you might want to turn to a Business Intelligence (BI) tool for complex data sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use free datasets&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have your data and are confident in its quality, it’s time to put it to work. You can go a long way with tools like Excel, Google Sheets, and Google Data Studio, but if you really want best practices for your career data, you need to be familiar with the real deal: a BI platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A BI platform will provide powerful data visualization capabilities for any data set, from small CSVs to large data sets hosted in data warehouses, such as Google BigQuery or Amazon Redshift. You can play around with your data to create dashboards and even collaborate with others.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Top 10 VSCode Extensions for React</title>
      <author>Rohidul Islam</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Nov 2021 06:05:45 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/rohidhub/top-10-vscode-extensions-for-react-57g6</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/rohidhub/top-10-vscode-extensions-for-react-57g6</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-will-be-covered-here"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What will be covered here?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be covering 10 essential visual studio code extensions for React developers. These extensions will help you code faster, cleaner and easier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#top-10-vs-code-extensions-for-react"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Top 10 VS Code Extensions for React
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prettier – Code formatted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bracket Pair Colorizer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Auto Rename Tag&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VSCode React Refactor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ESLint&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;npm Intellisense&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TabOut&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;change-case&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EditorConfig for VS Code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#es7-reactreduxgraphqlreactnative-snippets-extension"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets&lt;/strong&gt; Extension
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript and React/Redux snippets in ES7+ with Babel plugin features for &lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"&gt;VS Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets"&gt;Install It&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prettier-code%C2%A0formatted"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Prettier – Code formatted&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://prettier.io/"&gt;Prettier&lt;/a&gt; is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Ens2WoU2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/images/prettier/projectB.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Ens2WoU2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/images/prettier/projectB.gif" alt="**Prettier – Code formatted**" width="880" height="276"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prettier – Code formatted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode"&gt;Install It&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#highlight-matching-tag"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Highlight Matching Tag&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This extension highlights matching opening and/or closing tags. Optionally it also shows the path to tag in the status bar. Even though VSCode has some basic tag matching, it's just that - basic. This extension will try to match tags anywhere: from tag attributes, inside of strings, any files, while also providing extensive styling options to customize how tags are highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VsUN0Z0w--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://images2.imgbox.com/71/2a/zIA1XCzK_o.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VsUN0Z0w--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://images2.imgbox.com/71/2a/zIA1XCzK_o.gif" alt="**Highlight Matching Tag**" width="529" height="306"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlight Matching Tag&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vincaslt.highlight-matching-tag"&gt;Install It&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#auto-rename-tag"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Auto Rename Tag
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automatically rename paired HTML/XML tag, same as Visual Studio IDE does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--btV6ZCG6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://github.com/formulahendry/vscode-auto-rename-tag/raw/HEAD/images/usage.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--btV6ZCG6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://github.com/formulahendry/vscode-auto-rename-tag/raw/HEAD/images/usage.gif" alt="Auto Rename Tag" width="880" height="573"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Auto Rename Tag&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag"&gt;Install It&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#vscode-react-refactor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;VSCode React Refactor&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This simple extension provides JSX refactor code actions for React developers.&lt;/p&gt;

No additional or vscode-specific files are required. As with any EditorConfig plugin, if &lt;code&gt;root=true&lt;/code&gt; is not specified, EditorConfig &lt;a href="https://editorconfig.org/#file-location"&gt;will continue to look&lt;/a&gt; for an &lt;code&gt;.editorconfig&lt;/code&gt; file outside of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Class Inheritance In Python</title>
      <author>Alvison Hunter Arnuero | Front-End Web Developer</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/allwissendjager/class-inheritance-in-python-4koa</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Howdie, folks!&lt;/strong&gt; Today we are going to learn a bit about the vast world of &lt;em&gt;**inheritance&lt;/em&gt;* from the realms of the OOP, or Object Oriented Programming: Are you guys ready for this amazing adventure? If so, let's go, pals!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-inheritance"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is inheritance?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you are now thinking in that old grumpy auntie of yours that always pulled your cheeks when you were little and that recently passed away and left a fortune for some of her relatives. If that was your case, then let me tell you that we are going to talk about a different type of inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the programming world, inheritance allows us to define a class that could possibly and positively inherit all of the methods and properties from another class, usually called the parent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parent class&lt;/strong&gt; is the class being inherited from, also known as base class. We usually call it &lt;strong&gt;Padre&lt;/strong&gt; in Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Child class&lt;/strong&gt; this one inherits properties and methods from another class, also known as derived class. This is &lt;strong&gt;Hija&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#parent-class-creation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Parent Class Creation
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will start building the parent class first. Any class can be a parent, hence, we will proceed to write the code using the regular classes syntax and structure, as any other class.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Represents any school member.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;SchoolMember&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Initialized SchoolMember for: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Tell my details.
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Name: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; Age: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You see? it was not that hard, pal! Now we have this blueprint of a school member that we could use as much as we want. But what happens if I just want to create another class and keep the parent structure plus some other features I might want to have in it? Well, that is where the Child class takes place to save the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#child-class-creation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Child Class Creation
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we would like to integrate the functionality and characteristics from another class in our own class, we need to pass the &lt;strong&gt;Parent class or Clase Padre&lt;/strong&gt; as a parameter when creating this class that we will call the Child class, or better yet, &lt;strong&gt;La Clase Hija&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the example below, we will create two new classes called Teacher and Student, both with the existing Parent properties from the initial &lt;strong&gt;SchoolMember Class&lt;/strong&gt;, but also creating some additional features of their own.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Represents a teacher.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Teacher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SchoolMember&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;salary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;SchoolMember&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;salary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;salary&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Initialized Teacher: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;SchoolMember&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Salary: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;salary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Represents a student.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Student&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SchoolMember&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;marks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;SchoolMember&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;marks&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;marks&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Initialized Student: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;SchoolMember&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Marks: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;marks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At this stage of the article, You might be wondering how to do when we already had a class and we would've liked to add additional properties and methods from another one, without losing its own independence as a class. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, this can be done by overriding the inheritance from a parent class using for this the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;init&lt;/strong&gt;() function&lt;/strong&gt;. This function is automatically invoked every time the class is being used to create a new object. Let's take a look at this in the following example.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Counselor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SchoolMember&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;SchoolMember&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now we have successfully added the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;init&lt;/strong&gt;() function&lt;/strong&gt;, keeping the inheritance of the parent class, we are now ready to add functionality inside this function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-super-function"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Super Function
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time has come for us to use some of the magic of the Object Oriented Programming and unleash one of its secret powers: There is a fantastic function called &lt;strong&gt;super()&lt;/strong&gt; that allows the child class to inherit all the methods and properties from its parent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it happens in real life with our kids with the parent characteristics and abilities, why not in programming with OOP classes as well, right folks?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that when using this function, you do not have to use the name of the parent element, it will automatically inherit the methods and properties from its parent.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Principal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SchoolMember&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#additional-properties-and-methods"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Additional Properties and Methods
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wait a minute:&lt;/strong&gt; All of this sounded great and stuff but, how do we go about adding our own methods and properties after this step? Do we still have a chance to do that or not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, pals, we actually can! let's learn about it in the following example where we will add the phone property to it:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Nurse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SchoolMember&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;phone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;SchoolMember&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;phone&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;phone&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you might've noticed, the phone property cannot be fixed, and passed into the Nurse class when creating SchoolMembers objects. So, the question arises: how do we pass the non-fixed value to it? Well, we simply add another argument in the &lt;strong&gt;init&lt;/strong&gt;() function as the example shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever feasible, We can definitively add methods to this class. Let's take a look at the updated example below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Nurse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SchoolMember&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;phone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;SchoolMember&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;phone&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;phone&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Hello, "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s"&gt;".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;Your Age is "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s"&gt;" years old and your Phone is: "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;phone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ok, enough technicality already: let's test this bad boys out by creating several instances of these classes and adding their respective parameters as needed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Let us put these babies in action by creating instances, shall we?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SchoolMember&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Bill Gates"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;56&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Teacher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Guido Van Rossum"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;64&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;95000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Student&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Alvison Hunter"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;41&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;900&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Counselor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Mark Zuckerberg"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;34&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Principal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Evan You"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Nurse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Sarah Drasner"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;99887766&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, we need to create a list with all these instances to iterate over each of them afterwards, just as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Declare an list containing all these instances
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;members&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;member&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;members&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Let's print each of their details
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;member&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;member&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;member&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Final Source Code:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All right, folks, we have come to the end of this article. Your adventure started with a quick look at single inheritance and then we learned how to call superclass methods and properties easily with super() function. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is only the beginning of a very deep topic, full of more interesting features, however, we have tried to put together enough information to at least cover the basic starting point of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please find below the final source code for you guys to test it out and play with it. Please leave your comments with some other approaches or better solutions, to update the post if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last&lt;/strong&gt; but not least, If you are a &lt;strong&gt;Python enthusiast&lt;/strong&gt;, I kindly invite you to take a look at my &lt;a href="https://bit.ly/3p9hpqj"&gt;Python and JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; YouTube Channel tutorials and subscribe whenever possible to help our community grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd like to give a special shout-out to my sister &lt;strong&gt;Kathya&lt;/strong&gt; for bringing Python to my head today. This event got me inspired to write this article after I spoke to hear about the beauty of this fantastic programming language.&lt;/p&gt;






&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Represents any school member.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;SchoolMember&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Initialized SchoolMember for: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Tell my details.
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Name: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; Age: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Represents a teacher.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Teacher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SchoolMember&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;salary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;SchoolMember&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;salary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;salary&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Initialized Teacher: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;SchoolMember&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Salary: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;salary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Represents a student.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Student&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SchoolMember&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;marks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;SchoolMember&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

      <title>VS Code extension improve your project version management</title>
      <author>Joe</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Nov 2021 04:03:58 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/joejo/how-to-developing-in-a-multi-version-tob-web-project-21l0</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/joejo/how-to-developing-in-a-multi-version-tob-web-project-21l0</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#background"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Background
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team mainly maintains Tob web projects, and each project has multiple versions that are maintained concurrently. For example, after project A is deloyed to different customers for use, subsequent iterations are upgraded in the form of versions for customers to pay for, and customers can also purchase different versions , After a long time, V1.0, V2.0, V3.0 will appear... This kind of situation where multiple versions are used by different customer groups, in the normal development process, a certain feature or bugfix is in V1.0 After the above development is completed, if you want to apply to other versions such as 2.0, 3.0..., you have to submit one by one and then check out to switch between different versions for development and maintenance. The code with similar versions is okay. Cherry-pick can directly apply this commit, and When the version span is large and the business code gap is large, this action of switching the checkout branch is indispensable. Even if you clone multiple codes by creating a new folder, you need to open a lot of vscodes to switch back and forth. What's more troublesome is that if you want to run a project self-test or development preview, you also face tedious and time-consuming operations such as frequent modules-reinstallation of dependencies, which wilfully consumes our development time cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to improve this situation through technical means? Or if there is a tool or plug-in that can list all versions of files, so that files between different versions can be easily modified or run services back and forth in the current editor panel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on this idea, i decided to develop a vscode plug-in to implement a tool for checking out multiple versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#solution"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Solution
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development tool used in our team is vscode, so we can solve the above problems by developing a plug-in. The main functions of the plug-in should have:&lt;br&gt;
     · List all branches (ie versions) for checkout;&lt;br&gt;
     · The checked out branch and the current project are listed side by side in the same editor panel, which is convenient for real-time development;&lt;br&gt;
     · Add terminal opening support;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#implementation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Implementation
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use git for project version or branch management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#implementation-analysis"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Implementation analysis:
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​     · List branches: All major versions can be easily identified with incremental branch names, for example: v1.0.0, v2.0.0&lt;br&gt;
​     · Version check out: use git worktree&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#list-branches"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  List branches
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the third-party library simple-git to call the git command to find out all branches:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hvqsvRC7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uuzjk5144yxeg9a969kf.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hvqsvRC7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uuzjk5144yxeg9a969kf.png" alt="Image description" width="740" height="144"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#version-checkout"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Version checkout
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using git-worktree: Git worktree is a multi-repository and multi-work area management model launched by git in 15 years: a git repository can support multiple work trees, corresponding to different branches. We create a (main) working area (tree) (main working tree) in git through "git init" or "git clone".&lt;br&gt;
Specific information: &lt;a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree"&gt;https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MZBgIaSB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zw4ho5wgy3uaa06jicqi.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MZBgIaSB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zw4ho5wgy3uaa06jicqi.png" alt="Image description" width="737" height="153"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#plugin"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Plug-in
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the above implementation scheme, the implemented vscode plugin has been released (based on vscode 1.62+): version shuttle &lt;br&gt;
Plug-in Link:&lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=liquidityVision.version-shuttle"&gt;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=liquidityVision.version-shuttle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#instructions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Instructions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lists all branches (ie versions):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3Cm2NFK4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://p9-juejin.byteimg.com/tos-cn-i-k3u1fbpfcp/0989e4ba3c6649a3af3db7a03c52e893%257Etplv-k3u1fbpfcp-watermark.image" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3Cm2NFK4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://p9-juejin.byteimg.com/tos-cn-i-k3u1fbpfcp/0989e4ba3c6649a3af3db7a03c52e893%257Etplv-k3u1fbpfcp-watermark.image" alt="Image description" width="678" height="616"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Checkout branch (ie version):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--D7qezDzn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://p6-juejin.byteimg.com/tos-cn-i-k3u1fbpfcp/45721313966b436a8c932a9d892182d6%257Etplv-k3u1fbpfcp-watermark.image" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--D7qezDzn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://p6-juejin.byteimg.com/tos-cn-i-k3u1fbpfcp/45721313966b436a8c932a9d892182d6%257Etplv-k3u1fbpfcp-watermark.image" alt="Image description" width="678" height="616"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#table-of-contents"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Table of contents
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Introduction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persisting database information with a mounted volume&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dumping and restoring database information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever lose database information using a PostgreSQL docker container? We all know that we should never use a docker container to hold database data because when deleted, the data is gone with it, right? right???&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OMG YOU DID.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so did I. There was one time when I started learning how to use Docker containers. Docker containers are very handy and they are operating system independent. The world is covered with sunshine and rainbows. Shit happens when it comes to a database container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, I forgot to think about where the container holds its information. I was once use a postgresql container as a database instance for my application. Before deploying for production, I thought I should restart this once to refresh it. (Idk why but yea…) I typed &lt;code&gt;docker-compose down&lt;/code&gt; followed with &lt;code&gt;docker-compose up&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a good 1 minute of thinking that everything was ready for production and Imma leave and watch Netflix. And then, a panic comes in. I opened my application and found out that all my tables, all my configurations were gone into oblivion. The result was I had to reconfigure everything. Took me quite some time to get it working again. Good thing is at least it didn’t happen during production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, I will show you how to persist data of a postgresql docker container and how to restore them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#persisting-postgresql-database-information-with-a-mounted-volume"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Persisting PostgreSQL database information with a mounted volume
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll first create our database using docker-compose. Please copy the following script into a docker-compose file then run &lt;code&gt;docker-compose up&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;3.1'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;postgres&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;restart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;always&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;POSTGRES_USER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;myuser&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;POSTGRES_PASSWORD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;mypassword&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;POSTGRES_DB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;mydb&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;volumes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;./data:/var/lib/postgresql/data&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Please notice on the volumes block. You can see that we mounted a volume &lt;code&gt;data/&lt;/code&gt; in the host machine to &lt;code&gt;/var/lib/postgresql/data&lt;/code&gt; directory of the postgresql container. This is a necessary step to do in order to persist data on the host machine. Because when the container is deleted, this directory will continue to exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you start the container, you’ll see a &lt;code&gt;data/&lt;/code&gt; directory showed up in your host machine. This directory is where all postgresql information is.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;ll
total 16
drwxr-xr-x  3 siraphob-wsl-ubuntu siraphob-wsl-ubuntu 4096 Nov 21 16:29 ./
drwxr-xr-x  4 siraphob-wsl-ubuntu siraphob-wsl-ubuntu 4096 Nov 21 16:26 ../
drwx------ 19                 999 root                4096 Nov 21 16:29 data/                &amp;lt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt; HERE
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;-rw-r--r--&lt;/span&gt;  1 siraphob-wsl-ubuntu siraphob-wsl-ubuntu  232 Nov 21 16:28 docker-compose.yml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s test that our theory is correct. Shell into the database container by running the following command.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;docker &lt;span class="nb"&gt;exec&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-it&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt;your-postgres-container-id&amp;gt; bash
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once you’re inside the container, run the following command to connect to the postgresql console.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;psql &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-d&lt;/span&gt; mydb &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-U&lt;/span&gt; myuser
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s create a table and insert some data.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sql"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;CREATE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;TABLE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;IF&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;EXISTS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;accounts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;serial&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;PRIMARY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;VARCHAR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;UNIQUE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;INSERT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;INTO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;accounts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;VALUES&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'rick'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'morty'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;RETURNING&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you select rows from the table accounts, you’ll see the following result.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sql"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mydb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=#&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;accounts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rick&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;morty&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After that, exit from the the container. And run docker-compose down to stop the container and remove it. Technically, everything should be gone. But as you can see that the data/ directory still persists.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# stop and remove container&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;docker-compose down
Stopping pg-persist-ex_db_1 ... &lt;span class="k"&gt;done
&lt;/span&gt;Removing pg-persist-ex_db_1 ... &lt;span class="k"&gt;done
&lt;/span&gt;Removing network pg-persist-ex_default
&lt;span class="c"&gt;# container is gone&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
&lt;span class="c"&gt;# data directory still persists&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;ls
&lt;/span&gt;data  docker-compose.yml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, run docker-compose up again to start the database container. If you shell into the container and log in into the postgresql console. You can see that your table data isn’t lost.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sql"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mydb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=#&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="n"&gt;List&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;relations&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="k"&gt;Schema&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="n"&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;Type&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;Owner&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;--------+----------+-------+--------&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;accounts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;table&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;myuser&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;mydb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=#&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;accounts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;----+----------&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rick&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;morty&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;rows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And that’s how you persist database information of a docker-container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dumping and restoring PostgreSQL database information&lt;br&gt;
Another way to backup database information is to dump it out. Database dump is an export utility that helps you export database meta-data and data rows into a file. The dump file could later be imported into a new database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dumping allows you to export only meta-data (schemas, tables, relationships) or both meta-data and data rows. In this case, I’m going to show you how to export all information from a database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To backup your postgres database from a docker container, please run the following command.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;docker &lt;span class="nb"&gt;exec&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-t&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt;your-postgres-container-id&amp;gt; pg_dumpall &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-U&lt;/span&gt; postgres &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; dump_&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;date&lt;/span&gt; +%d-%m-%Y&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"_"&lt;/span&gt;%H_%M_%S&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;.sql
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you open the dump file, scroll down and you’ll see that it has our database information.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sql"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;file&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;opened&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;vim&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;179&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;CREATE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;TABLE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;accounts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;180&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;integer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;181&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="n"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;character&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;varying&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;182&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;183&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;184&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;185&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;ALTER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;TABLE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;accounts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;OWNER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;TO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;myuser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;216&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;217&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;-- Data for Name: accounts; Type: TABLE DATA; Schema: public; Owner: myuser&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;218&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;219&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;220&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;COPY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;accounts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;stdin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;221&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="n"&gt;rick&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;222&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="n"&gt;morty&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;223&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you want to restore database information from a dump file, please run the following command.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cat &lt;/span&gt;your_dump.sql | docker &lt;span class="nb"&gt;exec&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-i&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt;your-postgres-container-id&amp;gt; psql &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-U&lt;/span&gt; myuser
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You could try this on your own on a fresh postgres container to see the effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s it for today. Now you’ll never lose your database information again. Happy coding!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dynamic Pipeline Orchestration using CodePipeline, CodeBuild and Step Functions</title>
      <author>omuthu</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Nov 2021 01:31:38 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/aws-builders/dynamic-build-orchestration-using-codepipeline-codebuild-and-step-functions-2kpa</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/aws-builders/dynamic-build-orchestration-using-codepipeline-codebuild-and-step-functions-2kpa</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS CodePipeline helps in orchestrating CI/CD pipeline all the way from building and testing to deploying applications, from development to production environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, one of the limitations of AWS CodePipeline is its inability to dynamically execute or skip any pipeline action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post demonstrates how to setup a CI/CD pipeline to dynamically orchestrate and execute actions based on inputs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aws-services"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AWS Services
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This solution uses the following AWS services:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AWS CodeCommit – Source Control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AWS CodeBuild – Build System&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AWS CodePipeline – Continuous Delivery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AWS Step Functions - Workflow automation using state machines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#solution-overview"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Solution Overview
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A change or commit to the code in the CodeCommit application repository triggers CodePipeline with the help of a CloudWatch event.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pipeline downloads the code from the CodeCommit repository, initiates the first build using CodeBuild and securely saves the built artifact to an S3 bucket.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once build succeeds, pipeline triggers a Step Function Workflow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step Function workflow uses artifact from previous build as input and iterates for each item in the input&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For each input, it triggers respective CodeBuild or Pass state using Choice state &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step Functions will succeed once all invoked builds suceed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#architecure"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Created a repo and have a file "sample_source.json" with below content &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;{"services":["service_A", "service_B"]}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#first-codebuild"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  First CodeBuild
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It copies &lt;a href="https://github.com/omuthu-personal/codepipeline-stepfunction-integrations/blob/master/source/sample_source.json"&gt;source file&lt;/a&gt; and generates ABC.json which is passed as output artifact and consumed by next Step Function&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is optional when codebuild can generate a similar json file with list of services to be passed as input to step functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/omuthu-personal/codepipeline-stepfunction-integrations/blob/master/codebuild/first-codebuild-buildspec.yaml"&gt;BuildSpec&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These are the actual builds invoked by step functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/omuthu-personal/codepipeline-stepfunction-integrations/blob/master/codebuild/serviceA-buildspec.yaml"&gt;ServiceA BuildSpec&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/omuthu-personal/codepipeline-stepfunction-integrations/blob/master/codebuild/serviceB-buildspec.yaml"&gt;ServiceB BuildSpec&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-functions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step Functions
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---Y96_I7J--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ccdl114nf8ae4paydohx.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---Y96_I7J--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ccdl114nf8ae4paydohx.png" alt="State Machine" width="491" height="299"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/omuthu-personal/codepipeline-stepfunction-integrations/blob/master/stepfunctions/state-machine.json"&gt;State Machine json&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The artifact passed as json file will be received as json input by step functions state machine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It receives the input using a "Map" state which supprts iteration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within iterator, "Choice" state is used to validate the values and invoke respective "Task" or "Pass" state &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The "Task" state in our scenario will invoke a CodeBuild task using "Optimized Integrations"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CodeBuild task supports only sync invocation which means the next state following CodeBuild execution has to wait until it finishes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, since the iterator uses a "Choice" state, each iteration is independent and happens in parallel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this example, for "ServiceA" and "ServiceB", CodeBuild is executed and "ServiceC" is set as a "pass" state&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#note-ensure-enough-permissions-are-granted-for-stepfunctions-iam-role-to-make-relevant-service-invocations"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Note: Ensure enough permissions are granted for StepFunctions IAM role to make relevant service invocations
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/codebuild-iam.html"&gt;StepFunction IAM permissions for CodeBuild&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#codepipeline"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  CodePipeline
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--m8s9boDv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r44f3ly3b1wjzn4uz687.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--m8s9boDv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r44f3ly3b1wjzn4uz687.png" alt="CodePipeline Definition" width="880" height="826"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/omuthu-personal/codepipeline-stepfunction-integrations/blob/master/codepipeline/codepipeline-definition.json"&gt;CodePipeline Definition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once all the above steps are done, all we need to do is to create pipeline in CodePipeline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create Source stage using any SCM, I used CodeCommit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a Build stage using existing "First Codebuild" build project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create next "Step Sunctions" stage with following params

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Action Provider: Step Functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Input artifacts: Output Artifact from previous "First CodeBuild"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;State machine ARN: Choose the recently created stateMachine ARN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Input type: File Path&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Input: ABC.json (use whatever file is sent in output artifact from previous build)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#execution"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Execution
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Release a change to test the pipeline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this example, if services list changes in "sample_source.json", step functions will execute only those states&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This solution demonstrated the invocation of Step Functions from CodePipeline and Step Functions execution executing builds in CodeBuild dynamically based upon the received input&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>A quick guide for package.json dependencies management</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you've just studied html, css and basic javascript and are starting with some framework that uses node, like react, you may have some doubts about managing dependencies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let's take a look at some useful commands and get rid of the fear of play with package.json!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lets-start"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  let's start
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let's create the package.json file using the following command in the terminal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm init -y&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this command, we generate a standard package.json file like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  "name": "project-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" &amp;amp;&amp;amp; exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When working with node, some dependencies are used for development purposes and others will remain until the end. So we will have two fields:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;"dependencies": {},
"devDependencies: {}"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's start by installing a normal dependency and then we'll pass it on to the development dependencies and understand how to manipulate their versions. Let's use express as example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install express&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;"dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1"
  }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's understand what this symbol and numbers represent:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;"dependencies": {
    //          prefix
    "express": "^    4.     17.    1",
    //               major  minor  patch
  }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Patch: normally, when a bug is fixed, the patch value is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minor: when new features are added but compatibility is not broken, the minor value is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major: when new features are added and there is a break in compatibility with previous features, the major value is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prefix: some symbols used by the node to update dependencies using the &lt;code&gt;npm update&lt;/code&gt; command, such as ^ or ~. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can use them to install a dependency like: &lt;code&gt;npm install express@~2.0.0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we use the "^", we are saying that we only want to keep the "patch" and "minor" up to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we use the "~", we are saying that we only want to keep the "minor" up to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without the prefix we are looking for an exact version. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we use "-E" like &lt;code&gt;npm install express -E&lt;/code&gt;, there will be no prefix and the dependency will never be updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, what if we want to move express into the &lt;code&gt;"devDependencies: {}"&lt;/code&gt;? For that we use the following command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install express --save-dev&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with that our express will be inside &lt;code&gt;"devDependencies: {}"&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;"devDependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1"
  }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To get our express back to production dependencies, we use the following command: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install express --save-prod&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we can use &lt;code&gt;npm install express@latest&lt;/code&gt; to get the latest version (may not be stable) and &lt;code&gt;npm uninstall express&lt;/code&gt; to uninstall the dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To list all our dependencies, we can use &lt;code&gt;npm ls&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But sometimes our projects have a lot of dependencies, so if we just want to see the main ones we've installed, we can use a depth control like: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm ls --depth=0&lt;/code&gt; and keep increasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To check if any dependencies are out of date we can use &lt;code&gt;npm outdated&lt;/code&gt; and we will be informed of updates according to the prefixes used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#i-hope-you-have-enjoyed"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  I hope you have enjoyed!
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you have any other command tips, leave it in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
