      <title>Host React/Angular/Vue Site on Netlify</title>
      <author>yashvant vala</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/yashvant/host-reactangularvue-site-on-netlify-20gb</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hosting your own site is really easy, In this article we gonna see how can we host our front end in netlify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also hosting concept will be the same whether it is netlify or vercel or heroku. If you learn any of them then you will be able to host your static site anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let's start&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 1:- Create sample website(maybe in react/angular/nextjs) and push it in GitHub&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 2:- Sign up to Netlify&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have singed up you will see the following screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--G5XIF01x--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3ldbl66fvo6cfaf9wkda.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--G5XIF01x--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3ldbl66fvo6cfaf9wkda.jpg" alt="Main screen" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now click on the &lt;strong&gt;new site from git&lt;/strong&gt; button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After click on it, you will see the following screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6no1U-bT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/owkpcl5vh7377n3jt3x3.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6no1U-bT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/owkpcl5vh7377n3jt3x3.jpg" alt="Netlify home screen" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 3 :- Select the platform where you have pushed your code (in our case it will be github)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you select the platform you need to authorize the platform to access the repo of your site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will see the following screen once you click on github or any button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--61WVDDvm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wy62qd9qdpm9pu9mbrtn.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--61WVDDvm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wy62qd9qdpm9pu9mbrtn.jpg" alt="Netlify site selection screen" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can search/select any private/public repo of your GitHub etc. and can select it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you select repo/project to deploy, you will see below screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JJZrsbKi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ujlrqr7yi27u1nis4dek.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JJZrsbKi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ujlrqr7yi27u1nis4dek.jpg" alt="Netlify deployment screen" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can select relevent branch of your project and you need to set command to build your project and you have to provide the path of your site build. If you have react project the it will be npm run build and for angular it will be ng build, you also can find build command in package.json or just google it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will see below screen after you clicked on &lt;strong&gt;deploy site&lt;/strong&gt; button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gv6jXrrD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8jvhh8mjiuw0yujxit9p.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gv6jXrrD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8jvhh8mjiuw0yujxit9p.jpg" alt="project setting" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here my site name will be &lt;strong&gt;thirsty-hoover-727570.netlify.app&lt;/strong&gt;,  you can also change the domain name or you can provide custom domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can change domain name in domain setting which will be similar to below image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sSWi8jDk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wi7olax5fdwqde6u94vg.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sSWi8jDk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wi7olax5fdwqde6u94vg.jpg" alt="domain change" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that's it, how easy it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note - If you want to make update in your website you need to push latest code to your repo and you need to redeploy it, you will find the option for redeployment in your project on netlify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading, let me know in comment section if there is anything which is difficult to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Beginner To Pro - Python Learning Path</title>
      <author>EniRox</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/enirox/beginner-to-pro-python-learning-path-18k7</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-learn-python"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why Learn Python
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python is one of the best programming languages of the 21st century. It's not going anywhere anytime soon. Why? Well, because it's easy to learn, a clean and structured programming language with powerful capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So having seen how important a programming language Python is, How exactly should a beginner start to learn it. One of the most frustrating things about learning a programming language is how generic the learning resources are, which makes newbie programmers quit learning particular programming because of how intimidating learning may seem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what exact path should a beginner take to learn Python programming language. Where should I start? What projects should I do? What frameworks should I use?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the learning path I would take to learning Python as a newbie programmer. This is just my research of what works for me and what I believe could work for you. So without further ado let's get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python Basics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data Structures and Algorithms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web Development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web Scraping and Automation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#python-basics"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Python Basics
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the most important step of learning python as it simply cannot be skipped, You have to learn the very basic syntax of the programming language, this will serve as a foundation for you to go into any deeper learning. You however should not waste too much time on this as it's not very motivating. You can check out books to learn to program, pick one of the numerous courses on Udemy. You can even learn it for free on python's official website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#data-structures-and-algorithms"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Data Structures and Algorithms
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DSA is the next path to take as a newbie developer. learning Data Structures and Algorithms can be daunting and difficult, &lt;em&gt;it was for me&lt;/em&gt;.but one should not that it is one of the most important skills to have, not just as a Python Programmer, but as an overall programmer. This is because programmers that are proficient in Data Structures and Algorithms can easily perform any task about Calculations, Data Processing, Automated Reasoning, etc.DSA shows your problem-solving skills and abilities among prospective employers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#web-development"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Web Development
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One area Python shines is in the area of web development. With a variety of frameworks to choose from including Flask, Django, Web2Py, Bottle.py, CherryPy. Being proficient in web development with python will enable you to create almost any web application of your choice. Web Development is also a very lucrative field, hence knowing web development will provide you with higher job opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#web-scraping-and-automation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Web Scraping and Automation
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python is mostly known as one of the best web scraping languages. This enables you to handle web crawling/scraping processes smoothly. BeautifulSoup is one of the most python frameworks that make web scraping an easy task to do. And Python also enables one to create scripts that automate repetitive tasks in a very efficient way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area where Python shines is in the area of AI and ML as it has been pegged as the est Programming language for AI. It offers great libraries and frameworks as it offers scientific computations, statistical calculations, computational capabilities, and much more. So if you fancy creating the next &lt;em&gt;JARVIS&lt;/em&gt;, you can't go wrong with Python&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#projects"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Projects
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one although not on the list is one of the things you should not outlook, as much as you will be learning the programming language, you must build projects. This does not only solidify your learning and skills, it's going to provide you with an arsenal of projects you can show to prospective employers. So even as you learn... Build&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-do-you-want-to-do"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What Do You Want to Do
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that this is from a personal point of view. Learning paths should be done based on what you want to do with the language of your choosing, The learning path for a data scientist or mobile developer might be completely different from the ones I've stated above. This is a more generalized way of learning the programming language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I will be writing a more detailed article on the resources to use to learn soon. Follow and Subscribe so that you don't miss out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Changelog #0005 — 📚 Library</title>
      <author>Cláudia Delgado</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 12 Dec 2021 11:56:35 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/claudiatd/changelog-0005-library-264j</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/claudiatd/changelog-0005-library-264j</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another week, another update on our mission to provide the best experience to anyone working with APIs. &lt;a href="https://httpie.io/blog/changelog-0004"&gt;Last week&lt;/a&gt; we launched the desktop app, making HTTPie the first API testing platform with fully-fledged clients for the Web, Desktop, and Terminal. This week we kept working down the list of the most anticipated features. Check out what's new 👇&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#httpie-for-web-amp-desktop"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  HTTPie for Web &amp;amp; Desktop
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#collections"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  📁 Collections
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collections arrived in HTTPie! Collections are folders where you can store requests. Their duty might seem humble for now, but they'll grow to have superpowers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UjgEnuSB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://httpie.io/Blog/changelog-0005/collection-VOTNHC5O.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UjgEnuSB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://httpie.io/Blog/changelog-0005/collection-VOTNHC5O.png" alt="HTTPie collections" width="880" height="591"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To save* and organize requests, go to your library, create a new collection, and start adding requests to it. Then create as many more as you need, with as many requests as you need as well. Any changes will be auto-saved. An organized and tidy space will speed up your flow through APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*The library is a feature preview with local storage. In an upcoming release, we’ll sync your data across devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#drafts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ⏳ Drafts
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even your ad-hoc requests are now auto-saved in the built-in Drafts collection. Drafts are fully functional requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mTmCXtVW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://httpie.io/Blog/changelog-0005/drafts-RCL36LII.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mTmCXtVW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://httpie.io/Blog/changelog-0005/drafts-RCL36LII.png" alt="HTTPie drafts" width="880" height="591"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you start editing a new request, it will be saved as a draft in your library. You can go back to it anytime, no need to keep its tab open. To keep a request around permanently, move it to a collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't need a draft anymore, you're free to delete it. Or clean all drafts at once, if you need a fresh start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#named-requests"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🏷️ Named requests
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can now organize requests in the library, it makes sense to name them. It's part of keeping a workspace organized; it helps to recall and differentiate them. And you'll no longer have tabs that look all the same, as a user has pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HoSnPtWo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://httpie.io/Blog/changelog-0005/named_request-CEGQCTLW.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HoSnPtWo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://httpie.io/Blog/changelog-0005/named_request-CEGQCTLW.png" alt="HTTPie named requests" width="880" height="591"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can rename a request either through the tab context menu or in the library. Easy! But then comes the complicated part: picking a good name. Here's a tip, an emoji can be worth a thousand words 😜&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#improvements"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ✨ Improvements
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keyboard shortcuts fan? So are we! We’re working on a robust keyboard shortcut system. For now, we added at least &lt;code&gt;Cmd + Enter&lt;/code&gt; (macOS) or &lt;code&gt;Ctrl + Enter&lt;/code&gt; (elsewhere) to send the request you're working on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Desktop app is now optimized for your shiny new M1 Mac. It's Apple Silicon-ready! If you’ve previously installed the Intel version, HTTPie will automatically upgrade to the Apple Silicon one when installing the update.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#fixes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🪲 Fixes
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed the auto-update of the Desktop app, so you're always working on its latest version.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From time to time, the app logged you out. It shouldn't now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The tabs had some little edges to be polished. Now, they're smooth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#httpie-for-terminal"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  HTTPie for Terminal
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are improvements on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/httpie/httpie"&gt;development version&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://httpie.io/cli"&gt;HTTPie for Terminal&lt;/a&gt; and in the docs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#runnable-terminal-examples"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  📟 Runnable terminal examples
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Show, don’t tell! It’s been possible to &lt;a href="https://httpie.io/cli/run"&gt;try online&lt;/a&gt; even the Terminal version of HTTPie for a while now. But starting today, you can also run all examples while reading the docs or the blog straight in the browser. There’s no better way to learn than through direct experience. &lt;a href="https://httpie.io/docs#usage"&gt;Try it out&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#improvements"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ✨ Improvements
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who would say no to more speed? Nobody!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For large files, download performance is now 3.5x faster. (&lt;a href="https://github.com/httpie/httpie/pull/1236"&gt;#1236&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Startup performance is about 30% faster if the environment has pyOpenSSL (this is on top of the gains &lt;a href="https://httpie.io/blog/changelog-0004"&gt;announced last week&lt;/a&gt;). (&lt;a href="https://github.com/httpie/httpie/pull/1233"&gt;#1233&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#fixes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🪲 Fixes
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Broken plugins would crash the whole application, yikes! They no longer do. (&lt;a href="https://github.com/httpie/httpie/pull/1228"&gt;#1228&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#happy-testing-and-see-you-next-week"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Happy testing, and see you next week!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

      <title>How to Build Type Safe API with Typegoose and Express.js</title>
      <author>Francisco Mendes</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 12 Dec 2021 11:54:33 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/franciscomendes10866/how-to-build-type-safe-api-with-typegoose-and-expressjs-20oa</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/franciscomendes10866/how-to-build-type-safe-api-with-typegoose-and-expressjs-20oa</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#overview"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Overview
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most popular libraries for interacting with a MongoDB database is without a doubt mongoose. But we have a problem, if you want to create a totally Type Safe API, you will always have a small loss with mongoose models. I mean, there are ways to get around this, but it would be amazing if you could do this in a totally natural way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where &lt;a href="https://typegoose.github.io/typegoose/"&gt;Typegoose&lt;/a&gt; comes in, which is basically a wrapper to create TypeScript templates in an easy way. I bet that at some point you've already tried TypeORM and most likely liked working with classes and decorators to define the fields of your entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Typegoose has a very similar approach and it turns out to be immensely intuitive and after we define our model we end up with two things, the entity itself and the data types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#todays-example"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Today's example
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In today's example I will share with you a simple way to configure a Node.js project with TypeScript and then we will CRUD an entity that we will have in the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#project-setup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Project setup
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a first step, create a project directory and navigate into it:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;mkdir &lt;/span&gt;ts-typegoose
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;ts-typegoose
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, initialize a TypeScript project and add the necessary dependencies:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm init &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-y&lt;/span&gt;
npm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;typescript ts-node-dev @types/node &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--save-dev&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, create a tsconfig.json file and add the following configuration to it:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;compilerOptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;sourceMap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;outDir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;dist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;strict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;lib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;esnext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;esModuleInterop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;experimentalDecorators&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;emitDecoratorMetadata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;esnext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;moduleResolution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now let's add the following script to our package.json file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;scripts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;ts-node-dev main.ts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now proceed with the installation of the Express and Typegoose dependencies (as well as their development dependencies):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; @typegoose/typegoose express mongoose &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--save&lt;/span&gt;
npm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; @types/express &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--save-dev&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lets-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Let's code
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now let's create a simple API:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// @/main.ts&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Typegoose Example 🤟&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Server started on port 3000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the API to be initialized on port &lt;code&gt;3000&lt;/code&gt; just run the following command:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm start
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now we can import mongoose into our &lt;code&gt;main.ts&lt;/code&gt; and we will connect to the database.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// @/main.ts&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mongoose&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;mongoose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mongoose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;mongodb://root:root@localhost:27017/typegoose?authSource=admin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Server started on port 3000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now with the connection made, we can start working on our database entities. In this example we will have a model called &lt;em&gt;Dog&lt;/em&gt;, which will contain some properties such as name, breed, age and whether our four legged friend has been a good boy or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To define our model we will use Typegoose as you might have expected, then we will create a class called Dog that will be public (will be exported). Finally, we will use Typegoose's &lt;code&gt;getModelForClass()&lt;/code&gt; function which will be responsible for creating the model through the class.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// @/models.ts&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;prop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getModelForClass&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@typegoose/typegoose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;prop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;required&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kr"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;prop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;required&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kr"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;breed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;prop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;required&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kr"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;prop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;required&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kr"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;isGoodBoy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;DogModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getModelForClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now we go back to our &lt;code&gt;main.ts&lt;/code&gt; and we will import the class and our model, the class will be used as data type in our application and the model will be used to interact with the collection in our database.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// @/main.ts&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mongoose&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;mongoose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;DogModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now that we have everything we need to create our routes, we can start by fetching all the documents we have in our collection.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/dogs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;allDogs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;DogModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;allDogs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now that we can fetch all documents, now let's fetch only one document from the collection via id.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/dogs/:id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;DogModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;findById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now we can fetch all documents and only one remains to insert documents into the database. For that, we will create a new document according to the data coming from the request body.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/dogs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;DogModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;201&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now it's necessary to implement the update of a specific document. Similar to what we did before, we will look for a document in the collection through the id and then we will update the model fields according to the properties coming from the request body.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;put&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/dogs/:id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;DogModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;updateOne&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;updatedDog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;DogModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;findById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;updatedDog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, it remains to delete a document from the collection. Again, we will look for this element in the collection through the id and then this same document will be removed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;delete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/dogs/:id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;deletedDog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;DogModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;findOneAndDelete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;deletedDog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you may have noticed at the endpoints for updating and removing documents from the collection, the data of the updated/deleted element is returned in the response body just so that they have some kind of feedback on the action taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final code of our &lt;code&gt;main.ts&lt;/code&gt; is as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// @/main.ts&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mongoose&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;mongoose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;DogModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/dogs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;allDogs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;DogModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/dogs/:id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

      <title> what is dogecoin?</title>
      <author>arz today</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 12 Dec 2021 11:19:17 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/arzdigiman/what-is-dogecoin-2i9b</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/arzdigiman/what-is-dogecoin-2i9b</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The cryptocurrency dogecoin went on a rocket ride to the moon and back over the weekend after Elon Musk poked fun at it on Saturday Night Live before announcing on Monday that his company would accept it as legitimate payment for a mission to the moon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that sentence makes little sense to you, you're not alone. But read on for a primer about what exactly is going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing's first — what is dogecoin?&lt;br&gt;
Dogecoin was created in 2013 by a pair of software developers who worked at Adobe and IBM, respectively, as a parody of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies are a type of digital money that can be used to pay for things in the online world. Most of them, including dogecoin and bitcoin, are backed by an encrypted digital ledger of transactions, known as a blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are cryptocurrencies like bitcoin? Here's everything you need to know&lt;br&gt;
Named after a Shiba Inu dog that was the subject of an internet meme at the time, cryptocurrency enthusiasts and online jokesters began trading dogecoins for fractions of a penny. The first dogecoin that ever changed hands in early 2014 was worth $0.001540753 US. Today that same dogecoin is worth 50 cents US, an increase of more than 32,000 per cent.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While technically dogecoin exists as an offshoot of the original blockchain that bitcoin is on, it is not as secure as bitcoin, nor is there a cap on the number of dogecoins that can exist, as is the case with bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Unlike many other cryptocurrency projects, dogecoin does not seek, or even pretend, to be anything more than the world's most fun currency," is how Alex Thorn, head of research at TSX-listed investment management investment firm Galaxy Digital, described it in a research report last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it have to do with Elon Musk?&lt;br&gt;
Strictly speaking, nothing. But Musk, who recently became the richest man in human history, is a big fan of the cryptocurrency. Musk jumped aboard the doge train last year, mostly as a joke, but over the course of several months, comments he made about dogecoin on social media lent it more and more credence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His earliest mention of dogecoin came on Twitter in April 2019, when he called it "my fav cryptocurrency."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His fondness has only grown since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His electric car company, Tesla, became a major influence in cryptocurrencies in general, after it announced earlier this year that it would accept bitcoin as payment, and would hold bitcoin on its books as an asset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last quarter, the company revealed it has already stockpiled more than $1 billion US worth of bitcoin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happened this weekend?&lt;br&gt;
Musk hosted NBC's comedy show Saturday Night Live this past weekend, which led to speculation that he was likely to talk about the currency during his appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after, the price of dogecoin rose to a high of about 73 cents US on Thursday, according to cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WATCH | Elon Musk pokes fun at dogecoin on SNL's Weekend Update segment: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one SNL sketch, Musk, appearing as a fictional cryptocurrency expert, was asked to explain what exactly dogecoin is, and after some jovial back and forth, Musk's character admits the whole thing is a "hustle."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Musk's character saying elsewhere in the same sketch that dogecoin is "the future of currency" and "an unstoppable financial vehicle that's going to take over the world," the currency sold off after the sketch aired going as low as about 40 cents US per doge in the early hours of Sunday morning&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edward Moya, a market analyst with foreign exchange company Oanda, said large blocks of doge started selling fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Twitter quickly focused on the many whale alerts that showed a steady abandoning of massive dogecoin bets during [the show]," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why is dogecoin 'going to the moon' again? &lt;br&gt;
The dogecoin in-joke got a little more serious on Monday when Musk tweeted about his space exploration company's  next mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"SpaceX launching satellite Doge-1 to the moon next year," Musk tweeted without elaborating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More details came in a media release from Canadian manufacturing and logistics company Geometric Energy Corporation. The company said it will launch a 40-kilogram satellite into orbit on one of SpaceX's rocket. The release said the company would pay for the mission in dogecoin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This mission will demonstrate the application of cryptocurrency beyond Earth orbit and set the foundation for interplanetary commerce," SpaceX's vice-president Tom Ochinero. "We're excited to launch Doge-1 to the moon!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CBC News asked Geometric exactly how much dogecoin they are paying in exchange for their space on the rocket. That inquiry was not immediately returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following news of the deal, the cryptocurrency's price increased on Monday, topping 50 cents US at one point. Late in the day however, doge were going for around 46 cents, well below where they were before the show aired.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What are the Benefits of Building Web Apps as an ASP.NET?&lt;br&gt;
Microsoft enabled the ASP support to let developers use Microsoft tools, ecosystem, and C++ and C# for web development as well as for desktop. As a result, they achieved the goal of delivering a 100% cross-platform development environment. The main advantages of using .NET-based development tools as web development tools are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The possibility to write backend with C#: front-end, as usual, is written with JavaScript and its frameworks. However, for backend, developers can choose among multiple tech stacks, and Microsoft’s goal was to make C-based backend development easier. Developers can use JET packages and work in Visual Studio. &lt;br&gt;
A single development environment for JS, HTML, CSS, and C# development: developers can build syntax for dynamic web applications and immediately preview the app’s outputs sent to a user. &lt;br&gt;
.NET framework allows seamless integration of C# with JavaScript and provides libraries, templates, ready-to-use plugins for progressive web application, and single page application development. &lt;br&gt;
Another question here might be what’s the reason for using a framework for C#-based backend development? What are the advantages that specifically .NET delivers? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.NET just does what all good development frameworks are supposed to do. It provides developers with a ready-to-use application architecture, libraries with patterns and page templates, ready web app functionality (like authentication, access control, page display, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.NET framework&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, developers work in code editors that automatically complete code fragments, highlight code, sort through different sections efficiently, and support real-time editing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do ASP.NET Core vs ASP.NET Relate?&lt;br&gt;
You already understand the distinction between .NET and ASP.NET. Just to recap:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NET is a C#, C++, F# framework that makes desktop development easier and faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ASP.NET is a framework that has the same functionality as .NET, only it’s adapted to writing backend for web pages and web apps. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers can use the same tools, libraries, and infrastructure to build web and desktop projects. This way, a desktop development team can easily learn backend development, development takes less time, and cross-platform development becomes more effortless. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it’s not the only distinction in the .NET ecosystem. ASP.NET is only one of the versions of the framework. Another one is called ASP.NET Core. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core the Same?&lt;br&gt;
ASP.NET was the first version of the web-adapted .NET framework. ASK.NET Core is an improved version with richer functionality, a more comfortable interface, new libraries, and other distinctions. We’ll talk about their side-by-side comparison just in a minute, but here are the key points for now: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ASP.NET Core is the continuation of ASP.NET, an improved one;&lt;br&gt;
ASP.NET Core is available as an open-source tool;&lt;br&gt;
ASP.NET Core is cross-platform and runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows, unlike ASP.NET that works only on Windows;&lt;br&gt;
Just like ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core is based on the Model-View-Controller framework, like most web development frameworks;&lt;br&gt;
ASP.NET Core has robust Cloud support, and it supports modular architecture better than ASP.NET does. &lt;br&gt;
So, ASP.NET Core is a newer, more comfortable version of ASP.NET. Microsoft’s team understood what things could be improved in regards to user experience and improved the functionality. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Creating A Reusable Speedometer Component.</title>
      <author>Emmanuel Yusuf</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/emmanueloluwafemi/creating-a-reusable-speedometer-component-5emm</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Working on a project recently, I noticed that a speedometer is one of the functional components that are rare to find outside and a lot of developers are finding it so hard to come up with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speedometers can be used as a chart to display constantly updating data, to showcase real-time changes in something, and it gives the user a more friendly appeal they can relate to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we will be creating a speedometer component, making it reusable and also looking into how to get data dynamically to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outline&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding components structure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding trigonometry and how to apply it to UI design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating project structure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updating data dynamically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conclusion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand this tutorial, you will need to have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic Understanding of react JS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Node JS installed on your PC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Text Editor (Preferably VS Code)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terminal (CMD or any other terminals)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yd3FsswR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_7E6EF904F5206B75DD00F4DA14A64A7CF9DE15D916ED60EEBCB36E2BA3764F0C_1638838252256_speedometer.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yd3FsswR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_7E6EF904F5206B75DD00F4DA14A64A7CF9DE15D916ED60EEBCB36E2BA3764F0C_1638838252256_speedometer.jpg" alt="speedometer divided" width="633" height="357"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speedometer part is divided into 3 parts which are the display, the speed loader and the indicator bar, The display serves as the main screen where info (numbers) is shown to the users, The Speed Loader serves as a moving progress bar to show the user the level they are and last, the indicator bar is the pinpoint that rotates around the speedometer as the data changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding Trigonometry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trigonometry is one of the basic mathematics topics introduced in school, though they don’t mention the use case or how it can be applied, it is one of the mathematical solutions that is been applied when it comes to solving motion problems. We will be able to work with degrees and see how we can go around a circle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IN_-Jz2z--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_7E6EF904F5206B75DD00F4DA14A64A7CF9DE15D916ED60EEBCB36E2BA3764F0C_1638839288858_speedometer%2B1.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IN_-Jz2z--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_7E6EF904F5206B75DD00F4DA14A64A7CF9DE15D916ED60EEBCB36E2BA3764F0C_1638839288858_speedometer%2B1.jpg" alt="speedomter part" width="633" height="357"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the Project structure, we can carve it into a semi-circle which is divided into two parts that help to get the centre of the action, which is where the circles revolve around. This means that all the rotations we will be doing will revolve around the centre of the action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without much talk, let’s set up the project structure and move into coding the components themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project setup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we will be using react for the project, we need to first create a blank react project. Then we will install the necessary packages, firstly open your terminal and enter this command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx create-react-app Speedometer 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have successfully created the project, you should see something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--V2f7nqpb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_7E6EF904F5206B75DD00F4DA14A64A7CF9DE15D916ED60EEBCB36E2BA3764F0C_1638840000536_speedometer1.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--V2f7nqpb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_7E6EF904F5206B75DD00F4DA14A64A7CF9DE15D916ED60EEBCB36E2BA3764F0C_1638840000536_speedometer1.JPG" alt="speedometer divide" width="880" height="493"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have successfully created the project, you should see something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then open the code in a text editor and, let’s clean up the file structure by removing what we will not need there. Go to the src folder and delete logo.svg, reportWebVitals.js, setupTests.js, App.test.js and App.css.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open index.js and replace the code inside with this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
ReactDOM.render(
  &amp;lt;React.StrictMode&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;App /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/React.StrictMode&amp;gt;,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open app.js and replace the code inside with this also;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;function App() {
  return (
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
     Hello World
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
  );
}
export default App;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create two folders with the name: components and styles and open the components folder and create a file with the name speedometer.js inside, then open the styles folder and create a file with the name SpeedometerStyle.style.js and also a file name Wrapper.style.js.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be using styled-components for the styling, so we have to install styled-components to the project, go back to your terminal and install the package using this command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn add styled-components
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now open the Wrapper.style.js file and add the following code inside:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import styled from 'styled-components';
export const Wrapper = styled.div`
    width: 100%;
    max-width: 100vw;
    height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    background: #fff;
`
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the code above, we are importing the styled-components package we installed then we are using it to create a style we can be used everywhere on the project as a reusable component, the style set the width and height to 100vw and 100vh respectively, just for it to fill the user's screen and then centralize using flex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to set up the style for the Speedometer itself, open the SpeedometerStyle.style.js file and add this code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import styled from 'styled-components';

export const StyledSpeedometer = styled.div`
    width: 100%;
    max-width: 450px;
    margin-top: 3rem;
    .guage_body {
        width: 100%;
        height: 0;
        padding-bottom: 50%;
        background: #000;
        border-top-left-radius: 100% 200%;
        border-top-right-radius: 100% 200%;
        position: relative;
        overflow: hidden;
    }
`
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the style above, we are creating a rectangle with a width of 450px to get a semi-circle, making the guage_body width 100% and a 50% padding to the bottom, which will give us access to just 50% of the space we have. Then we use a border radius to the top left and top right of the rectangle, in other to perfectly curve it.&lt;br&gt;
Lastly, we make the position relative so that the 'body' children position can be set independently without issues and overflow as hidden in the other to hide anything going out of the guage_body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to Speedometer.js and add the following code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import React from 'react'
import { StyledSpeedometer } from '../styles/SpeedometerStyle.style'
import { Wrapper } from '../styles/Wrapper.style'
const Speedometer = () =&amp;gt; {
    return (
        &amp;lt;Wrapper&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;StyledSpeedometer&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;div className="guage_body"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/StyledSpeedometer&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/Wrapper&amp;gt;
    )
}
export default Speedometer
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the code above, we imported the styled-component we created for Wrapper and StyledSpeedometer, which is what we are using to construct the layout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the setup, let’s go to the App.js file and replace the code with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import Speedometer from "./components/Speedometer";
function App() {
  return (
    &amp;lt;Speedometer /&amp;gt;
  );
}
export default App;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just using the speedometer component we have created to display the content, If it is successfully implemented, we should have something like this when we run the code with "yarn start" from the terminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--C-AsL1na--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_7E6EF904F5206B75DD00F4DA14A64A7CF9DE15D916ED60EEBCB36E2BA3764F0C_1638862775243_Screenshot%2B48.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--C-AsL1na--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_7E6EF904F5206B75DD00F4DA14A64A7CF9DE15D916ED60EEBCB36E2BA3764F0C_1638862775243_Screenshot%2B48.png" alt="speedometer screenshot" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s continue, add the following line of code inside your Speedometer.js file inside the guage_body div tag&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div className="guage_body_cover"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;div className="guage_indicator_slider" /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;div className="guage_indicator" /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And open the SpeedometerStyle.style.js and update the style by adding this style inside the .guage_body section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;.guage_body_fill {
    position: absolute;
    top: 100%;
    left: 0;
    width: inherit;
    height: 100%;
    background: #000;
    transform-origin: center top;
    transform: rotate(0turn);
    transition: transform 0.2s ease-in-out;
}

.guage_indicator {
    position: absolute;
    width: 225px;
    height: 225px;
    top: 125%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    transform-origin: center top;
    transform: rotate(0.3turn);
    border-radius: 50%;
    background: #000;
    z-index: 7;
    &amp;amp;::before {
    }
}

.guage_indicator_slider {
    width: 4px;
    height: 22rem;
    background-color: #000;
    transform-origin: center;
    transform: rotate(0.3turn);
    margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

.guage_body_cover {
    width: 97%;
    height: 200%;
    border-radius: 50%;
    background: #fff;
    position: absolute;
    top: 3%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translateX(-50%);
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The output should be something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jX8nxg0r--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_7E6EF904F5206B75DD00F4DA14A64A7CF9DE15D916ED60EEBCB36E2BA3764F0C_1638890136693_speedometer2.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jX8nxg0r--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_7E6EF904F5206B75DD00F4DA14A64A7CF9DE15D916ED60EEBCB36E2BA3764F0C_1638890136693_speedometer2.JPG" alt="speedomter second step" width="880" height="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s move forward by adding the text board to the speedometer to get the numbers as it's changing, open your Speedometer.js file and update by adding this code to the below guage_indicator div.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div className="text_content"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;100&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Mbps&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And open the SpeedometerStyle.style.js and update the style by adding this style immediately after the guage_body class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;.text_content {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    background-color: #000;
    top: 80%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    z-index: 55;

    h3 {
        font-size: 2.25rem;
        font-weight: 400;
        color: #fff;
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
        text-align: center;
    }

    p {
        font-size: 1rem;
        font-weight: 300;
        color: #fff;
        text-align: center;
        padding: 0;
        margin: 0;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This style is to add style to the h1 tag and the paragraph tag, then position the text_content class to fit where we want it to be. We should have something like this once we are done&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HLDH7SSX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_7E6EF904F5206B75DD00F4DA14A64A7CF9DE15D916ED60EEBCB36E2BA3764F0C_1639013429895_screenshot3.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HLDH7SSX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_7E6EF904F5206B75DD00F4DA14A64A7CF9DE15D916ED60EEBCB36E2BA3764F0C_1639013429895_screenshot3.JPG" alt="speedometer third step" width="880" height="367"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our UI is ready. The next thing is to make it dynamic so that we can get data from external sources or backend and make it work perfectly without issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updating Data Dynamically.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to get dummy data to use, we will be using random data with the JavaScript Math API, so let’s create a snippet that generates a number in every second so still inside the Speedometer.js file, update it by adding a useEffect and add this code inside, it should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;// create a state to store the speed
const [speed, setSpeed] = useState(0)

// generates a random number between 0 and 35 every second
useEffect(() =&amp;gt; {
    setInterval(function(){   
      setSpeed(Math.floor((Math.random()*35)+1)); 
    }, 1000);
}, [])
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the code above, a speed state to store the speed, then a "useEffect" is used to run the interval immediately once the page loads, which updates every 1 second and using the Math.random function we create a random number from 0 to 35 and store it on the speed state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to update the speedometer so that we can update it once the speed state change, To achieve this, we need to create a ref for some of our div tags and also use another useEffect to update it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, let’s create our ref by creating a ref which will be hooked with some div tags, updating the code with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const turnRef = React.useRef(null)
const sliderRef = React.useRef(null)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then update the div tags with this to link the div with the ref&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div className="guage_body_fill" ref={turnRef} /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;div className="guage_body_cover"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div className="guage_indicator_slider" ref={sliderRef} /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, let’s create another useEffect and add this code inside&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;useEffect(() =&amp;gt; {
    const turn = speed &amp;gt;= 37.5 ? ((12.5 + 37.5) / 100) : ((12.5 + speed) / 100)
    turnRef.current.style.transform = `rotate(${turn}turn)`
    sliderRef.current.style.transform = `rotate(${turn + 0.25}turn)`
}, [speed])
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the code above, we are using a useEffect that uses the speed as a dependency so that it will update once the speed value changes. Then we set a turn value which checks if the speed is greater and equal to 37.5. If yes, then it uses a fixed value which is (12.5 / 37.5) / 100. If no, then we will use (12.5 + speed) / 100.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why we are using 12.5 is that the circle is not complete and to start from the circle cutout we are adding the value to the speed value. Once the speed is more than 37.5 we stop it from going through the cut-out by restricting it with a fixed value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it should look like this after the update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bkjRHb5G--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_7E6EF904F5206B75DD00F4DA14A64A7CF9DE15D916ED60EEBCB36E2BA3764F0C_1639188512622_Screenshot%2B51.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bkjRHb5G--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_7E6EF904F5206B75DD00F4DA14A64A7CF9DE15D916ED60EEBCB36E2BA3764F0C_1639188512622_Screenshot%2B51.png" alt="code preview" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If everything is done correctly as it is in this tutorial, you should get something like this once you run the server again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1Hff3_4e--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_7E6EF904F5206B75DD00F4DA14A64A7CF9DE15D916ED60EEBCB36E2BA3764F0C_1639189634632_ezgif.com-gif-maker.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1Hff3_4e--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_7E6EF904F5206B75DD00F4DA14A64A7CF9DE15D916ED60EEBCB36E2BA3764F0C_1639189634632_ezgif.com-gif-maker.gif" alt="final product" width="600" height="338"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating this speedometer component actually helps in learning some aspects in react which include a look into trigonometry, updating CSS values and dynamically passing data to update CSS value, This component can be used in many use cases to suit different purposes, including getting the data from a backend and updating the style to suit your need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get this code, check it up on GitHub, by using this link&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>If-Else or Switch or Match - Laravel</title>
      <author>Morcos Gad</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 12 Dec 2021 11:03:51 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/morcosgad/if-else-or-switch-or-match-laravel-3h45</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/morcosgad/if-else-or-switch-or-match-laravel-3h45</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have an example of entering data of different type and here we use if&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'users'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$users&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nf"&gt;dd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$users&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'projects'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$projects&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nf"&gt;dd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$projects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But we want to make the code easier and less, so here I want to use switch&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;switch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'users'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$model&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'App\\Models\\User'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'projects'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$model&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'App\\Models\\Project'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$records&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nf"&gt;dd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$records&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But I want to covet more powerful code using php8 so I will use match&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$model&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'users'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'App\\Models\\User'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'projects'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'App\\Models\\Project'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$records&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nf"&gt;dd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$records&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Seven URL Shortener</title>
      <author>Rithvik Vukka</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 12 Dec 2021 10:56:53 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/rithvik78/seven-url-shortener-13n4</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/rithvik78/seven-url-shortener-13n4</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/"&gt;Flask&lt;/a&gt; is a framework for building web applications utilizing Python and &lt;a href="https://sqlite.org/index.html"&gt;SQLite&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org"&gt;sqlalchemy&lt;/a&gt; is a database engine that can be used to store application data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, We wil be buliding a URL shortener, a service that takes any URL and generates a short URL, similar to &lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/"&gt;tinyurl&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://bitly.com"&gt;bit.ly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to generate random strings for the alias using python [library](random(&lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html"&gt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be using Flask, SQLite to build your URL shortener. Our application will allow users to enter a URL and generate a shorter version, in addition to a statistics page where users can view the number of times a URL has been clicked. We will be using the &lt;a href="https://bulma.io"&gt;Bulma&lt;/a&gt; toolkit to style our application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;## Setting Up Dependencies&lt;br&gt;
 We need to activate environment and install Flask using the pip package installer. Then you’ll create the database you will use to store URLs.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;source env&lt;/span&gt;/bin/activate
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once you have activated your programming environment, install Flask and the sqlalchemy library using the following command:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;Flask
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;Flask-SQLAlchemy
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;python-dotenv
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-flaskenv-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;.flaskenv&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be adding a file &lt;code&gt;.flaskenv&lt;/code&gt;  to mention the directory of our app&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;FLASK_APP=url_shortener
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-env-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will add another file &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; to set admin username, password and database url as environment variables.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=password
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-app-files"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating APP files
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, We will create a new directory to store all our flask files&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;mkdir &lt;/span&gt;url_shortener
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First we will be creating Dunder init file  to write &lt;code&gt;create_app()&lt;/code&gt; function and have the settings file. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-urlshortenerinitpy-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;url_shortener/__init__.py&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;flask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Flask&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;.extensions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;.routes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;short&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;create_app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;config_file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'settings.py'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Flask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from_pyfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;config_file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;init_app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;register_blueprint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;short&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;settings file will be holding the settings for the app and will be related to &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
we will be adding SQLAlchemy URI, ADMIN_USERNAME and ADMIN_PASSWORD to the file in order to make it ease to edit in future. We will turn off track modification for SQLAlchemy.      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-urlshortenersettingspy-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;url_shortener/settings.py&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;environ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'DATABASE_URL'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;ADMIN_USERNAME&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;environ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'ADMIN_USERNAME'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;ADMIN_PASSWORD&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;environ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'ADMIN_PASSWORD'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To import db objects we will create &lt;code&gt;extensions.py&lt;/code&gt; file. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-urlshortenerextensionspy-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;url_shortener/extensions.py&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;flask_sqlalchemy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SQLAlchemy&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SQLAlchemy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We will init database in Dunder init file too.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To shorten links we will be making a &lt;code&gt;model.py&lt;/code&gt; file.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-urlshortenerextensionspy-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;url_shortener/extensions.py&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;choices&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;.extensions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Column&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;primary_key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;original_url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Column&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;512&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;short_url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Column&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;unique&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;visits&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Column&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;date_created&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Column&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;DateTime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;short_url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;generate_short_link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;generate_short_link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;characters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;digits&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ascii_letters&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;short_url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;choices&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;characters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filter_by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;short_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;short_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;generate_short_link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;short_url&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We have created a table &lt;code&gt;Link&lt;/code&gt; in which we will have the following columns:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  id - Integer, primary key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  original_url - String&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  short_url - String, unique&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  visits - Integer, default=0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  date_created - DateTime, default=datetime.now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have extended Dunder init to call the methods with keyword arguments. Then, we will call &lt;code&gt;generate_short_link&lt;/code&gt; where we will get a random 7 letters string from Upper case, Lower case or  Numbers. For this we have used &lt;code&gt;choices()&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;random&lt;/code&gt; library. We will check if the generated string exists in our database and if it exits we will run again to get unique string. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we are done with our model. So, we need to redirect our generated string to the original url. We will create &lt;code&gt;routes.py&lt;/code&gt; file.  Main motto of this app is for personal use. So, we will be using basic authentication. We will be having &lt;code&gt;check_auth()&lt;/code&gt; function which will be comparing the username and password with the ones given as environment variables. &lt;code&gt;authenticate()&lt;/code&gt; will be saying that authorization is required. In &lt;code&gt;requires_auth()&lt;/code&gt; it will ask for authorization if its not authorized else it will check for authorisation with &lt;code&gt;check_auth()&lt;/code&gt; then it will return the function keyword arguments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-urlshortenerauthpy-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://flask-httpauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;url_shortener/auth.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;functools&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;wraps&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;flask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;current_app&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;check_auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;#This function is called to check if a username password combination is valid.
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;current_app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'ADMIN_USERNAME'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; \
        &lt;span class="ow"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;current_app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'ADMIN_PASSWORD'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;authenticate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;#Sends a 401 response that enables basic auth
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;'Could not verify your access level for that URL.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;'You have to login with proper credentials'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;401&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'WWW-Authenticate'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'Basic realm="Login Required"'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;requires_auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;wraps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;decorated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;authorization&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;check_auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;authenticate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;decorated&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We will be adding the authorisation as decorator in &lt;code&gt;routes.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we will create a &lt;code&gt;Blueprint&lt;/code&gt; - &lt;code&gt;short&lt;/code&gt; . Now we need to create some endpoints. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;code&gt;/short_url&lt;/code&gt; will be used to redirect the url. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; will be used for index. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;/add_link&lt;/code&gt; will be used to add the url and will be using &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; method. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;/stats&lt;/code&gt; will be used to display the statistics. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;errorhandler(404)&lt;/code&gt; will be shown when the user goes out with a random link. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to work with routes we need to create &lt;code&gt;html&lt;/code&gt; files, which we will be trying to keep simple - have used &lt;a href="http://bulma.io/"&gt;Bulma&lt;/a&gt; to do it so. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will create a directory for these files.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;mkdir &lt;/span&gt;templates
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-urlshortenertemplatesindexhtml-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;url_shortener/templates/index.html&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;charset=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"utf-8"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"viewport"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;URL Shortener&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;rel=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"stylesheet"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bulma/0.7.5/css/bulma.min.css"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Tangerine'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;rel=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'stylesheet'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;defer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.3.1/js/all.js"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.center&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;30px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;3px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nl"&gt;text-align&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ctrlKey&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shiftKey&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;keyCode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;73&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;This function has been disabled to prevent you from stealing my code!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ctrlKey&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;keyCode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;85&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;This function has been disabled to prevent you from stealing my code!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;This function has been disabled to prevent you from stealing my code!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;preventDefault&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;attachEvent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;oncontextmenu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;This function has been disabled to prevent you from stealing my code!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;returnValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We will be calling function in &lt;code&gt;add_link()&lt;/code&gt; method to get the short url. Then, we will call render template that link is added and we will display the generated url by passing the generated short url and original url. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;short_url()&lt;/code&gt; we will be using &lt;code&gt;redirect()&lt;/code&gt; function from flask to redirect short url to original url and get the counts of visits by using a counter which increments whenever the short url is called to redirect the original url.  If the short url is not found in the database it will be redirected to 404 error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then from &lt;code&gt;stats&lt;/code&gt; we will redirect the visit counts along with original and short url to the rendered template. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-urlshortenerroutespy-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;url_shortener/routes.py&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;flask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Blueprint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;render_template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;redirect&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;redirect_to_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;short_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filter_by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;short_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;short_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;first_or_404&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;visits&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;visits&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;render_template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'index.html'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;short&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'/add_link'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;methods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'POST'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;commit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;render_template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'link_added.html'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;new_link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;short_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;original_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;original_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;short&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'/stats'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;requires_auth&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;stats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;links&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;render_template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'stats.html'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;links&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;links&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;short&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;errorhandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;404&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;page_not_found&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;render_template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'404.html'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;404&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We will then add &lt;code&gt;register_blueprint()&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;__init__.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-the-database"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating the database
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to create the database now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance in order to setup, We need to make some changes to &lt;code&gt;url_shortener/settings.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'sqlite:///db.sqlite3'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;#os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL')
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;ADMIN_USERNAME&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;environ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'ADMIN_USERNAME'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;ADMIN_PASSWORD&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;environ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'ADMIN_PASSWORD'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;python3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;shortener&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;create_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;shortener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;extensions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;shortener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;create_all&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;create_app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After noticing &lt;code&gt;db.sqlite3&lt;/code&gt; we can change the &lt;code&gt;SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI&lt;/code&gt; back as before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can cross check the table if its created.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;sqlite3 db.sqlite3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sql"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sqlite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tables&lt;/span&gt;                                                                                                                                             
&lt;span class="n"&gt;link&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;sqlite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#source"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://github.com/rithvik78/URL-shortener"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full Source Code: &lt;a href="https://github.com/rithvik78/URL-shortener"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://rithvik7.pythonanywhere.com"&gt;Deployment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#deploy-locally"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Deploy Locally
&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;flask run
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We can find the app locally deployed at &lt;a href="http://127.0.0.1:5000/"&gt;http://127.0.0.1:5000/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;username: admin
password: password
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>What is Semantic HTML and Why Should We Care?</title>
      <author>Dylan Oh</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 12 Dec 2021 10:26:37 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/ohdylan/what-is-semantic-html-and-why-should-we-care-4h59</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/ohdylan/what-is-semantic-html-and-why-should-we-care-4h59</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;HTML tags tell the browser how to structure, and display the content for the web pages. Semantic HTML is a feature which we can write HTML codes in a more descriptive way. It makes people understanding the role of this line or chunk of codes, instead of how they should structure or look like. Before semantic HTML, we often see a bunch of div tags, p tags, span tags, which tells nothing about their content and we normally use an "id" to tell what they are for (or commenting). However, we can do this in a more self-explanatory way without putting id, or classes just to describe what their roles are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are codes before semantic HTML:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"header"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"nav-bar"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"index.html"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Home&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"about.html"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;About Us&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"main"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     This is the section where main content goes.
     &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"content"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;This is for section 1 content.&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"content"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;This is for section 2 content.&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"content"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;This is for section 3 content.&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"footer"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;This is for footer.&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is with the utilization of semantic HTML.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;header&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;nav&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"index.html"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Home&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"about.html"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;About Us&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/nav&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/header&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;main&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     This is the section where main content goes.
     &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Section 1&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;This is for section 1 content.&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Section 2&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;This is for section 2 content.&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;article&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;figure&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                     &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/whatever.png"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                     &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;figcaption&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                          This is the image caption.
                     &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/figcaption&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Article content goes here.&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/article&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Section 3&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;This is for section 3 content.&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/main&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;footer&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;This is for footer.&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/footer&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These are some examples of semantic HTML introduced in HTML5 that you can use in your codes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;header&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Containing introductory items for the webpage and navigation menu. It is similar but different from &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;, as &amp;lt;header&amp;gt; is used to represent the section, and &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt; is used to put the title for that section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;footer&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Containing the footer information for example copyrights, privacy policy, contacts, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;nav&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Containing navigation links&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;main&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Represents the main content area, this should only be used once in the page
&lt;a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-main-element"&gt;A document must not have more than one main element that does not have the hidden attribute specified.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;section&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Represents a standalone generic section, each section should ideally have a header for that section itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;figure&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;figcaption&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This self-contained element can be used to group image with its caption&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element"&gt;And there are around 100 of them...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#here-are-some-of-the-benefits-of-using-semantic-html"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Here are some of the benefits of using semantic HTML:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Readability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;header&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;footer&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;nav&amp;gt;... they act mostly like a &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;, however this will give a clearer understanding of what are the contents inside these blocks. From the two code blocks above, (I feel that) the second block is easier to read and understand. As a developer, we often need to look at other people's codes. Therefore, semantic HTML would definitely improve the reading experience of your codes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Improve SEO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
These keywords will improve the search ranking of your content because it provides richer information instead of &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; which tells nothing to the search engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Accessibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Semantic HTML will improve the accesbility of your web page, which gives clear context to audiences who access these pages through a &lt;a href="https://axesslab.com/what-is-a-screen-reader/"&gt;screen reader&lt;/a&gt;, or relying on keyboard-only navigation (using tab key to jump from section to section). For example, you might want to use &amp;lt;button&amp;gt; instead of just solely the &amp;lt;a&amp;gt; tag for a button. For additional information, you may also assign "role" attribute to &amp;lt;a&amp;gt; with the value of button. This will also be recognized by screen reader.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I hope this gives you an insight of what semantic HTML is and how this could improve our code quality. Cheers.&lt;br&gt;
