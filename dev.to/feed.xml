&lt;p&gt;Coinbase is one of the first cryptocurrencies in the world to be owned by the United States. Coinbase was founded in 2012 in San Francisco, California by Brian Armstrong and Fred Arsham.&lt;br&gt;
That same year, Armstrong received $ 150,000 in funding from Coinbase investors. In less than a year, sales reached one million a month.&lt;br&gt;
He also worked with companies such as Dell and Dish Network.&lt;br&gt;
The Coinbase exchange started with a small business that initially only worked with bitcoin, but eventually supported other coins as well, increasing the number of its employees.&lt;br&gt;
This exchange has been constantly growing and improving its features since the beginning of its 7-year life.&lt;br&gt;
It is worth $ 8 billion today. The exchange operates under two brands, Coinbase and Coinbase pro. Coinbase is more focused on customers and investors who want to buy bitcoins with Fiat currency, while Coinbase pro is a more advanced platform for cryptocurrency exchanges that supports other currencies and larger traders. Coinbase Pro was originally known as GDAX.&lt;br&gt;
The Coinbase exchange is still thriving, and even the outbreak of Covid19 has not stopped it, most Coinbase employees work remotely. The CEO claims that telecommuting has been very successful for the company and has been able to attract top talent from other US states, and not only has it not been harmless, but in addition to high profits, it has led to an increase in staff and better services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-does-coinbase-work"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How does Coinbase work?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users must first register on the cryptocurrency exchange platform. By entering user information such as name, email and then setting a password and verifying the email address you can then create a complete account and log informally.&lt;br&gt;
To start using Coinbase, there are two ways to buy cryptocurrency, these two methods are different, and you can choose one of them based on their features, which are described below.&lt;br&gt;
Using your bank accounts or credit card are two ways you should link to an exchange platform account. The two methods of buying cryptocurrency are different in terms of transaction speed and restrictions. &lt;br&gt;
Users who choose to link to their bank accounts are limited to transactions worth $ 2,500 per week. The downside is that it takes 2-4 business days for the purchased and sold coins to be displayed in the Coinbase account. While users who link their credit cards will immediately show the currencies they have purchased and exchanged in their Coinbase accounts. The downside is that this option has a higher trading limit of $ 250 per week.&lt;br&gt;
If the user chooses to buy a coin using a bank account, he/she will be asked to perform one or two trial transactions. If linking a credit card, users must send a screenshot of the card they want to link to Coinbase.&lt;br&gt;
Once the account is set up, users can exchange cryptocurrencies. Before each transaction, the cost of services and the number of coins purchased are displayed to the user. Once the user has sufficient funds, he can start his business. This platform provides details of the trade cost and purchase amount for verification. Once secured, encrypted currencies are stored in your wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;

      <title>Dynamic components, a Vue.js superpower</title>
      <author>Reynold Osei Adade</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 10:13:03 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/reynoldadade/dynamic-components-a-vuejs-superpower-2olk</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/reynoldadade/dynamic-components-a-vuejs-superpower-2olk</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you have ever encountered tabs in your code, then its likely there is one of 3 things that have been implemented&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;v-if and v-else&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nested routes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dynamic components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are ever in the situation where you have to implement anything that requires you to conditionally show one component at a time, if you are thinking of using &lt;code&gt;v-if and v-else&lt;/code&gt; then please consider using dynamic components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dynamic components if used well require less code in your template and finer control over the components being displayed, all in all keeping the conditions out of your html and into your JavaScript where it is easier to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concepts are best explained in code, so lets start with the code below which is basically a project that illustrates one of the use cases for dynamic components, the code consists of 4 component&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;index.vue&lt;/strong&gt;  which is just the wrapper for the other components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Personal.vue&lt;/strong&gt; which contains a form for collecting personal details&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Work.vue&lt;/strong&gt; which contains a form for collecting work details&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;ViewSubmit.vue&lt;/strong&gt; for displaying the gathered data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main point of focus should be &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;component /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;keep-alive&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/keep-alive&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;component /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; requires a single prop, &lt;code&gt;is&lt;/code&gt; which is just the name of the component you want to display as a string, other than that is behaves just like any other custom component that you build, it takes custom props like any other component&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be able to keep the component in the dom with all its states you can wrap it with &lt;code&gt;keep-alive&lt;/code&gt; this ensures that if the component is switched all its data is kept just as it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you have ever wondered how to split forms into multiple sections but still keep your data, this is one way to do it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//index.vue&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;w-full p-10 flex flex-col justify-center items-center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;p-2 w-1/2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;button in buttons&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;button.name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;flex-1 p-2 border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As an extra bonus for using dynamic components you get to have the all your props available to all components all the time, this in a way saves you a lot of repetitions. But if you are like me and you want to fine tune which props are available to which components, especially in the scenario where you want the same prop names to contain different data you can use this nifty little trick I picked up&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//index.vue optional&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;w-full p-10 flex flex-col justify-center items-center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;p-2 w-1/2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;button in buttons&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;button.name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;flex-1 p-2 border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;{

&lt;p&gt;What the code below does is to return props based on the current component being shown. You can use this method to gain finer control over your props&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//computed value&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nx"&gt;changePropsByComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;switch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Personal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;savePersonalDetails&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;savePersonalDetails&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Work&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;saveWorkDetails&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;saveWorkDetails&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;setCurrentComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCurrentComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;ViewSubmit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="na"&gt;work&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;work&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="na"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;personal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;a href="#what-is-vanillaextract"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🧑🏽‍🍳 What is vanilla-extract?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post we look at how to get started using vanilla-extract with SvelteKit.  Before we get going though, we should spend a moment looking at what vanilla-extract is and why you might want to use in a project or at least try it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;vanilla-extract is a modern &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS"&gt;Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)&lt;/a&gt; preprocessor, which generates plain CSS stylesheets.  It is TypeScript friendly and leans on TypeScript to add some extra useful features.  You can create your style in TypeScript files which sit alongside your Svelte code and import the styles, adding them as classes to your components.  The way you use them is similar to CSS modules usage pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll get a proper introduction shortly, but here's a sneak peak as a teaser.  Here we define some style in our &lt;code&gt;index.css.ts&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;heading&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;fontSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fontSize5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;then consume it it a Svelte file:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;lang=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"ts"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;heading&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;./index.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;heading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Example&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Heading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CSS is generated at compile time, meaning there is no overhead at runtime (when the user opens up the page).  Having TypeScript support allows you create &lt;strong&gt;styling policies&lt;/strong&gt; and ensure they are enforced by your team (or even by you when you return to the code in six months' time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will look at an example of theming our site.  In doing so, we will create a &lt;strong&gt;theme contract&lt;/strong&gt; (this is quite straightforward) and just means if we decide to add a Christmas theme in a month we can be fairly comfortable it won't break the site as long as we define the colours etc, required by the theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-is-vanillaextract-different-to-vanilla-css-sass-tailwind-etc"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  😕 How is vanilla-extract different to vanilla CSS, Sass, Tailwind etc.?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first heard about vanilla-extract on the JS Party podcast.  They had a &lt;a href="https://changelog.com/jsparty/190"&gt;show on the process Shopify used for replacing Sass&lt;/a&gt;.  I won't tell you what they opted for, in case you want to listen to the show!  Anyway &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rxrRTlbNWiLVu-Q5IK7xh5O1FmWcjyAS2XN7jiPrhYM/edit#gid=0"&gt;Shopify generated a grid of the pros and cons for each solution&lt;/a&gt;, comparing Sass, CSS, Tailwind and other frameworks.  If you are looking at switching CSS tooling, definitely consider adapting that grid to your own use case to help inform your decision process.  On top there is a &lt;a href="https://github.com/Shopify/foundational-design-system-proto/discussions/44"&gt;top notch GitHub discussion on replacing Sass too&lt;/a&gt;.  Although titled “Replacing Sass”, the process was open and keeping Sass was a possible solution.  Hopefully those resources answer any questions you have on the relative merits of the different solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-use-vanillaextract-for-styling"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🌟 Why use vanilla-extract for styling?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like vanilla-extract for a few things, probably the most important ones to me are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is modern with wide support — although we focus on SvelteKit here, &lt;a href="https://github.com/seek-oss/vanilla-extract/#setup"&gt;vanilla-extract works with ESBuild, Vite and Snowpack as well as Next.js and other React site generators&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you create efficient CSS files with zero runtime overhead,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contracts offer a built-in way of enforcing styles, and preventing issues like colour drift over time.  This is where, for example, you might hardcode a colour in CSS while debugging or checking contrast ratio and forget to swap it out for a variable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-were-building"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🧱 What we're Building
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll knock up a minimal Single Page App advertising a couple of courses for a fictitious event.  We will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;see how to configure vanilla-extract for SvelteKit,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create a couple of themes,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add a contract for new themes so they need to have all our colour variables defined.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MQP3GGCt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/34fy072xdwnzeghxaygi.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MQP3GGCt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/34fy072xdwnzeghxaygi.png" alt="Using vanilla-extract with SvelteKit: What we're Building: Summer Theme: Screenshot shows a summary of a course with the title and a picture of the speaker.  Above is a button labelled Summer theme.  The sites shows bright colours invoking a summer feel." width="870" height="1482"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qqCtLLmp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ebpsrbqkrb5q26wnyt9q.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qqCtLLmp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ebpsrbqkrb5q26wnyt9q.png" alt="Using vanilla-extract with SvelteKit: What we're Building: Winter Theme: Screenshot shows a summary of a course with the title and a picture of the speaker.  Above is a button labelled Summer theme.  The sites shows muted colours invoking a winter feel." width="870" height="1276"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as seeing the vanilla-extract features in action we will see how to store the chosen theme in the browser local storage and a little bit of animations in SvelteKit.  If there's anything there you can get excited about then let's get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#using-vanillaextract-with-sveltekit-getting-started"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ⚙️ Using vanilla-extract with SvelteKit: Getting Started
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a new SvelteKit skeleton TypeScript project:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pnpm init svelte@next sveltekit-vanilla-extract &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$_&lt;/span&gt;
pnpm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From the options, choose &lt;strong&gt;Skeleton project&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Use TypeScript:? Yes&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Add ESLint...? Yes&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Add Prettier...? Yes&lt;/strong&gt;.  Next we install the vanilla-extract plugins and some other packages we will use later, then start up the dev server:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pnpm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-D&lt;/span&gt; @vanilla-extract/css @vanilla-extract/css-utils @vanilla-extract/vite-plugin
pnpm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-D&lt;/span&gt; @fontsource/source-sans-pro @fontsource/source-serif-pro sharp vanilla-lazyload vite-imagetools @sveltejs/adapter-static@next
pnpm run dev
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We will use TypeScript in this tutorial to get the most out of vanilla-extract.  We only use minimal and basic TypeScript so, hopefully you can follow along, even if you are more comfortable with JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we will add vanilla-extract configuration to &lt;code&gt;svelte.config.js&lt;/code&gt;.  Thanks to Ben Jervis from the vanilla-extract maintainer team for helping to get this config working.  vanilla-extract is not yet (at time of writing) a 100%  ESM compatible package.  Without the &lt;code&gt;vite/ssr&lt;/code&gt; config (below) you can currently run a site in dev mode though to build, you will need the extra parameters.  Update &lt;code&gt;svelte.config.js&lt;/code&gt; to get started:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;adapter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@sveltejs/adapter-static&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;preprocess&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;svelte-preprocess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;vanillaExtractPlugin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@vanilla-extract/vite-plugin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;imagetools&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;vite-imagetools&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Consult https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-preprocess&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// for more information about preprocessors&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;preprocess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;preprocess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="na"&gt;kit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;adapter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;adapter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// hydrate the &amp;lt;div id="svelte"&amp;gt; element in src/app.html&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;#svelte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;vite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;define&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;process.env.VITE_BUILD_TIME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toISOString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()),&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;plugins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;vanillaExtractPlugin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;imagetools&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;force&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})],&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;ssr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;NODE_ENV&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;development&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="na"&gt;noExternal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@vanilla-extract/css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@vanilla-extract/css/fileScope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In line &lt;code&gt;20&lt;/code&gt; we are added the &lt;code&gt;imagetools&lt;/code&gt; plugin as well as &lt;code&gt;vanillaExtractPlugin()&lt;/code&gt;.  The former is not strictly needed for running vanilla-extract though we will use it on this site to help with processing images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extra &lt;code&gt;vite/ssr&lt;/code&gt; parameters (lines &lt;code&gt;21&lt;/code&gt;–&lt;code&gt;26&lt;/code&gt;) needed for building the site seem to break the dev site so we have a switch to change the config based on whether we have run &lt;code&gt;pnpm run dev&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;pnpm run build&lt;/code&gt;.  If you are quite new to SvelteKit, I should explain, &lt;code&gt;pnpm run dev&lt;/code&gt; lets you develop the site, with fast, hot reloading so when you change something it is updated straight away in your browser. Each time you integrate a new feature, it is a good idea to run &lt;code&gt;pnpm run build&lt;/code&gt; to generate a production-ready site and then &lt;code&gt;pnpm run preview&lt;/code&gt; to view that production-ready version of your site.  Hopefully that makes the first part of the paragraph clearer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#extra-setup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Extra setup
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For type consistency add the Lazyload type to the browser document (this is the &lt;code&gt;src/global.t.ds&lt;/code&gt; in your project):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;/// &amp;lt;reference types="@sveltejs/kit" /&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ILazyLoadInstance&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;vanilla-lazyload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;declare&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;global&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a last bit of setup, download a couple of images (&lt;a href="https://github.com/rodneylab/sveltekit-vanilla-extract/raw/main/src/lib/assets/blake.jpg"&gt;blake.jpg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/rodneylab/sveltekit-vanilla-extract/raw/main/src/lib/assets/river.jpg"&gt;river.jpg&lt;/a&gt;) which we will use on the site.  Place these in a new &lt;code&gt;src/lib/assets&lt;/code&gt; folder.  Finally, create a JSON file containing event details as &lt;code&gt;src/lib/data&lt;/code&gt; below.  Next, we will add our global vanilla-extract styles and variables.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

  💄  Vanilla Extract Styles
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's create a styles folder and add some vanilla-extract to our project.  Create a new directory at &lt;code&gt;src/lib.styles&lt;/code&gt;.  In there create &lt;code&gt;vars.css.ts&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;styles.css.ts&lt;/code&gt; and paste in the following content:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createVar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@vanilla-extract/css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;desktopBreakpoint&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createVar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fontFamilyHeading&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createVar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fontSize2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createVar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@media&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;(prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;transition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;250ms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;transition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;2000ms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first file you see how you can declare variables in vanilla-extract.  Using variables is handy when working with a design system and lets you easily change styles across the project quickly.  Later we will use these variables when styling our Svelte components.  The second file contains our global styles.  In there we define the variables (give them values) and also set some other global CSS like font families, much like you would in CSS or Sass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#using-vanillaextract-with-sveltekit-theming"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Using vanilla-extract with SvelteKit: Theming
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're only going to scratch the surface on what vanilla-extract can do with theming here.  We will create a theme template which will act as our &lt;strong&gt;theme contract&lt;/strong&gt;.  We then use that template to create a summer and winter colour theme.  Create a &lt;code&gt;src/lib/styles/themes&lt;/code&gt; folder and in there create &lt;code&gt;theme.css.ts&lt;/code&gt; and paste the content below.  This will be our template.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createTheme&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@vanilla-extract/css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;themeVars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createTheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;primary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;#f00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;secondary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;#f00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;alternative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;#f00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;light&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;#f00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;#f00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are only varying colours by theme, but in a fully-fleshed out project, you might add fonts, accessible styling and a whole host of other elements.  We will see in a moment when we create a actual themes, we will get a TypeScript error if we forget to define one of the theme colours.  This can be great when working in teams or on long-term projects making it harder to break the site by adding new themes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's create the summer and winter themes in the same folder:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createTheme&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@vanilla-extract/css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;themeVars&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;./theme.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;summerTheme&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createTheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;themeVars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;primary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;#d11c5b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// rubine red&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;secondary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;#fac600&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// mikado yellow&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;alternative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;#ea4b1d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// flame&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createTheme&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@vanilla-extract/css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Try commenting out one of lines where you define a colour in the &lt;code&gt;winterTheme.css.ts&lt;/code&gt; file.  You should get a warning in your code editor that a colour is missing.  This is one of the advantages TypeScript brings to the party.  Next we will create some components and use these themes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#home-page-styles"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🏠 Home Page Styles
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With vanilla-extract, we can define styles in a TypeScript file which sits alongside the page or component they will be used in. Then we import them into the Svelte file.  Let's create &lt;code&gt;src/routes/index.css.ts&lt;/code&gt; which will contain the styles needed for the home page:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;themeVars&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;$lib/styles/themes/theme.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fontFamilyHeading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fontSize2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fontSize4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fontSize5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fontWeightBold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;lineHeightRelaxed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;spacing0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;spacing2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;spacing4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;spacing6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;$lib/styles/vars.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@vanilla-extract/css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;calc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@vanilla-extract/css-utils&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;themeVars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;primary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;themeVars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;heading&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="na"&gt;minHeight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;calc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;lineHeightRelaxed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;multiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fontSize4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;multiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;marginBottom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;spacing0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;abstractText&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="na"&gt;marginBottom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;spacing6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;spacing2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;spacing4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;backgroundColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;themeVars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;themeVars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;secondary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dateText&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="na"&gt;fontSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fontSize4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;themeVars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;borderColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;themeVars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;light&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;themeVars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;secondary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;:focus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;themeVars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;light&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;:hover&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;themeVars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;light&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We see in line &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; that we import the template theme we just created.  Then throughout the file, we reference this.  In our svelte component, we will add the class for the current theme. vanilla-extract will generate the all the CSS we need for handling themes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will notice we are importing and using variables defined in our &lt;code&gt;styles&lt;/code&gt; folder. In line &lt;code&gt;41&lt;/code&gt; you can see an example of using our existing CSS variables to calculate the &lt;code&gt;minHeight&lt;/code&gt; for a text element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#store"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Store
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will use the browser local storage to keep track of which theme the user prefers.  Svelte stores will provide an interface between our components and local storage.  Make a store by creating &lt;code&gt;src/lib/shared/stores/theme.ts&lt;/code&gt; and adding the following content:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;browser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;$app/env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;writable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;svelte/store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;writable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;browser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;localStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;summer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;summer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;subscribe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;browser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;localStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In line &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt; we set the default value for the store, which is used when the page first loads.  It checks if there is a value already stored in the local storage for theme and defaults to summer. The code in line &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt; runs when our components update the store and sets the theme to the value passed in.&lt;/p&gt;

  🧩 Using vanilla-extract with SvelteKit: Components
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we add the markup for the home page, we will add some components which get used in the home page.  Naturally, these components will also use vanilla-extract so we will continue learning on the way. Create a components folder at &lt;code&gt;src/lib/components&lt;/code&gt; and add &lt;code&gt;Card.css.ts&lt;/code&gt; file with the following content:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;themeVars&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;$lib/styles/themes/theme.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;spacing3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;spacing4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;spacing6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;spacing8&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;$lib/styles/vars.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@vanilla-extract/css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;container&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="na"&gt;flexDirection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;column&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;alignItems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;60%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;borderRadius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;spacing3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;spacing6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;spacing4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;spacing8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@media&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;(max-width: 768px )&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;themeVars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;secondary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;borderStyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;solid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;borderColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;themeVars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;light&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now we can create &lt;code&gt;Card.svelte&lt;/code&gt; which will import these styles:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;lang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;$lib/shared/stores/theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;summerTheme&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;$lib/styles/themes/summerTheme.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;winterTheme&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;$lib/styles/themes/winterTheme.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;./Card.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;themeIsSummer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;$theme&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;summer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;contentStyle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;themeIsSummer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;summerTheme&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;winterTheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;section&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;contentStyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;slot&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This lets us see a few things. In line &lt;code&gt;7&lt;/code&gt; we can access the store with &lt;code&gt;$theme&lt;/code&gt; (we imported the file in line &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;).  All we do here is check what the theme is.  We use the store as a central source of truth, accessible in components. This means we don't have to pass the theme as a prop between components.  We imported styles from the &lt;code&gt;Card&lt;/code&gt; style file in line &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt;.  As an example, in line &lt;code&gt;11&lt;/code&gt;, you add the &lt;code&gt;container&lt;/code&gt; class variable to the &lt;code&gt;section&lt;/code&gt; element.  vanilla-extract does the magic to convert this to a class with a unique name and also generate the CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last interesting line here is line &lt;code&gt;8&lt;/code&gt; where we add the right class variable depending on the current theme.  We imported the themes in lines &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Speaker Picture Component
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's pick up the pace now and paste in a couple of files for pictures we use.  We add the responsive image boiler plate in full here, though for a larger project, it is probably &lt;a href="https://rodneylab.com/sveltekit-image-plugin/#component"&gt;worth using an image component to help&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;themeVars&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;$lib/styles/themes/theme.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;spacing1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;$lib/styles/vars.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@vanilla-extract/css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;borderRadius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;borderStyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;solid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;borderWidth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;spacing1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;borderColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;themeVars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;alternative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!--&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;svelte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ignore&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;lowercase&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;--&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;buttonStyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Book&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In terms of vanilla-extract we're not introducing new concepts here, which we haven't seen in other components.  You might notice we have added some animation.  Let me know if you would like a separate post focussing on animation with SvelteKit.  Svelte does make it easy to add a little polish with not too much effort.  We will just gloss over some details here so this post doesn't get too long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In line &lt;code&gt;63&lt;/code&gt; we use the &lt;code&gt;key&lt;/code&gt; keyword to let SvelteKit know which variable change will trigger the animation.  Here, this is &lt;code&gt;currentIndex&lt;/code&gt; which changes between zero and one.  The dynamic parts are within the &lt;code&gt;Card&lt;/code&gt;, but we can set animation parameters in a parent element.  We do that in line &lt;code&gt;65&lt;/code&gt; on the main element. There are a lot of different easing functions you can use.  Josh Nussbaum has put together a &lt;a href="https://svelte.dev/repl/d412618c0d7b48229a7a5956b95087a9?version=3.44.0"&gt;nice little playground to experiment with&lt;/a&gt;.  You can also &lt;a href="https://svelte.dev/tutorial/in-and-out"&gt;learn more about Svelte Transitions in the official tutorial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="#layout"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🏁  Layout
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final piece of the puzzle before testing is the layout.  In our layout component, we will add a switch for changing theme and also the related code for updating the store.  First add the styles to a new file: &lt;code&gt;src/routes/layout.css.ts&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;themeVars&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;$lib/styles/themes/theme.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;spacing12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;spacing2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;spacing4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;spacing8&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;$lib/styles/vars.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@vanilla-extract/css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;container&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="na"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;themeVars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;secondary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;containerMain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then let's paste in the Svelte (&lt;code&gt;src/routes/__layout.svelte&lt;/code&gt;) and take a quick look.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;lang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;browser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;$app/env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;$lib/shared/stores/theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;$lib/styles/styles.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;summerTheme&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;$lib/styles/themes/summerTheme.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;winterTheme&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;$lib/styles/themes/winterTheme.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;lazyload&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;vanilla-lazyload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;containerMain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;themeButton&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;./layout.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;browser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;lazyloadInstance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;lazyloadInstance&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;lazyload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;themeIsSummer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;$theme&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;summer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;buttonText&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;themeIsSummer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Summer theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Winter theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;buttonStyle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;themeButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentTheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;containerMain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentTheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;aria&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;buttonAriaLabel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;buttonStyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;$theme&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;summer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;winter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;summer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;buttonText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/butto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;n
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;slot&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most interesting part here is line &lt;code&gt;27&lt;/code&gt;.  When the user clicks the button, we change the theme in the store by calling &lt;code&gt;theme.set()&lt;/code&gt;.  This changes the theme for all components.  On top it triggers the code in our store file which sets the theme in local storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was a lot to get through! Thanks for following through to the end.  Go get a drink then and some fresh air so you can fully appreciate testing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything should be working now so you can go to &lt;a href="http://localhost:3000/"&gt;localhost:3000&lt;/a&gt; to take the site for spin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspect one of the site's elements and see what class you find.  You should see something like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"layout__12shizy0 layout__12shizy3 summerTheme__1660gci0"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    ...
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

vanilla-extract has generated a unique class name, giving us scoped styling without the need for BEM or a similar system.  Next, in your browser developer tools, open up Local Storage.  You should see something like:

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

}&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;


Try toggling theme to make sure this changes. Finally run `pnpm run build` then in your code editor find `build/_app/assets/winterTheme.css. ... .css`.  This is an example of the CSS files created by vanilla-extract.

If that's all worked give yourself a star!

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nicholas Salzano, a marketer from New Jersey, describes the importance of storytelling in digital marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storytelling, in advertising, is the demonstration of sharing a story that embodies interesting difficulties to depict an encounter your crowd will interface with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a once in a lifetime chance where your image can radiate through an alternate focal point. It's one of the essential components to consolidate into your content marketing strategy to guarantee your content resounds with the right group. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though it may appear to be a procedure selective for some organizations, the fact of the matter is that Storytelling works, paying little heed to the kind of business or brand. Each item and administration has a story to tell. Each brand and company possesses a unique story to impart to its clients. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nicholas Salzano is discussing How you present your image can have the effect between a faltering character and a moving one. Narrating empowers your organization to gain a more significant picture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can accomplish a passionate association with your clients by recounting a story identified with your image or organization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days, the item is taking a back stage, while the story is getting increasingly more significant. The accomplishment of Digital Storytelling lies in its attention to what individuals need to hear and share. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gone are the times of exhausting corporate informing; today, you need to make a compelling enthusiastic association with your objective through powerful stories. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of Storytelling is to foster compassion with your clients by utilizing tales about them. If you can cause them to feel like you're guessing their thoughts, you have made it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nicholas Salzano describes that this Content Marketing method is acquiring significance continuously because of the emotional advancement of Marketing Digital Content. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizations that comprehend the market's rise and the progressions around the client's media utilization propensities are beginning to zero in addition to digital narrating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, it's insufficient to fiddle with one Digital Storytelling mission and afterwards, return to the outdated ways. The endeavours should stay aware of digital time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, single organization storytelling has advanced into a transmedia experience, offering a more significant and comprehensive message. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As our social orders continue to raise more portable driven ages, there is an enormous chance region for advertisers in Digital Content and Storytelling efforts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The execution of this strategy includes the utilization of straightforward messages, illustrations, pictures, pictures and recordings that draw in with a specific public and give the brand's message. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For what reason Do We Tell Stories, by Nicholas Salzano?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone, from the most prepared leader to the freshest understudy, can recount a story. Yet, where does this adoration for accounts begin? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 100 motivations to recount stories: from engaging, to selling, to instructing. They're our method of sharing data. In light of a legitimate concern for saving time, we'd prefer to feature the accompanying three: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interfacing with your audience: Consumers typically think about brands as distant substances which direct the "common folk". Therefore, organizations ordinarily put on a show of being unfamiliar and unrelatable, ruining the advertiser's endeavours to cause them to seem genuine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stories tap into individuals' sentiments, motivating them to draw in with the brand and making a passionate connection between them. Prevail upon purchasers by creating an account around your image! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working on complex messages: How would you be able to catch a client's consideration in no time flat? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the quick moving climate they move in, you have an extremely restricted open door to communicate your thoughts! Stories give a way of avoiding this obstruction, bringing the idea sensible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uniting individuals: Throughout the planet, individuals from all societies comprehend the idea of a legend, a journey and triumph. Stories are a widespread language that fabricates a feeling of local area among a wide range of individuals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take Gillette, for instance: by focusing on fathers who are welcoming newborns into their homes, the brand has made a development that supported their deals by solidifying a local area that sees that the brand cares. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incredible Brand Storytelling Tips, by &lt;a href="https://nicholas-salzano.com/"&gt;Nicholas Salzano&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How frequently have you been attracted to a post's title, snared by the initial section and afterwards felt your eyes space out because you found a dull, mechanical illustration of not well-masked self-advancement? Try not to worry - it's happened to potentially anyone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realizing your crowd might seem like the last objective for some promoting experts, who wrap up their mission persuaded that their quality on the locales their objective gatherings most often visit is sufficient to have purchasers heading out toward the distant horizon with their image. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there's something else to add to that formula: in particular, discovering how to put forth your narrating attempts alluring for the client. Since, in such a case that they're not receiving anything in return, then, at that point, what's the utilization? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When to Use A/B Testing and Storytelling- Nicholas Salzano&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marketing experts are progressively going to A/B testing and AI while creating stories for brands' interest groups. AI is sufficiently brilliant to decide the necessities of each section, and A/B tests step in to track down the best option for every single one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The utilization of this apparatus can go from enormous scope alterations on an entire internet-based stage to the littlest subtleties on a solitary page. Take, for instance, the CTAs on the site or in the email's headlines: Which ones would it be advisable for you to utilize? Which phrasing, text style, size? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did clients with the significant adaptation of the title open a more substantial number of messages than those with the subsequent one? Which adaptation of the CTA got additional snaps from your customers? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerning A/B testing applied to narrating for advanced promoting, the standards continue as before: its endeavours should consistently be aligned with your organization's objectives. Have a good time and examination! Which plans and messages lead to more deals? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every one of the information your venture might gather, there will consistently be the everlasting matter of utilizing it well – regardless of whether you know your ideal interest group inside and out, patterns shift, clients develop, and each section may respond distinctively; to each message than another gathering! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Streamline your advanced encounters with A/B testing – offer your clients only excellent, and watch it pay off over the long haul.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Beginner's Guide to JavaScript Operators - Part Two</title>
      <author>Sumudu Siriwardana</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 09:52:24 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/sumusiriwardana/beginners-guide-to-javascript-operators-part-two-6m9</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the second part of the Beginner's Guide to JavaScript Operator! 😊&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To refresh your memory, In the  &lt;a href="https://dev.to/sumusiriwardana/beginners-guide-to-javascript-operators-part-one-eld"&gt;first article&lt;/a&gt;, we have gone through the arithmetic and assignment operators, and operator precedence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let's see what we will be going over in this article. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#table-of-contents"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Table of Contents
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#comparison-operators"&gt;Comparison Operators&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#logical-operators"&gt;Logical Operators&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#ternary-precedence"&gt;Ternary Operators&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#typeof-operator"&gt;&lt;code&gt;typeof&lt;/code&gt; Operator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--q4k4wJag--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634698304176/CHu6ZeOmp.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--q4k4wJag--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634698304176/CHu6ZeOmp.gif" alt="lets-get-going.gif" width="480" height="480"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#comparison-operators"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Comparison Operators
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use comparison operators to compare two values or variables. It is a binary operator which compares the operands and returns whether it's &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; depending on the comparison. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if you want to check whether &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt; is greater than &lt;code&gt;8&lt;/code&gt;, we use the greater than operator &lt;code&gt;(&amp;gt;)&lt;/code&gt; and write it as, &lt;code&gt;10 &amp;gt; 8&lt;/code&gt;, then it returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; because &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt; is greater than &lt;code&gt;8&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here's a list of comparison operators in JavaScript:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Operator Name&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Symbol&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Example&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;let x = 5&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Equal&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; if the operands are equal&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;code&gt;x == '5'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;(returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Not equal&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;!=&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; if the operands are not equal&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;code&gt;x != '6'&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt;(returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Strict equal&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; if the operands are equal and of the same type&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;code&gt;x === 5&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt;(returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Strict not equal&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;!==&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; if the operands are the same type but are not equal or are different types&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;code&gt;x !== '5'&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt;(returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Greater than&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; if the left operand is greater than the right operand&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;code&gt;x &amp;gt; 4&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt;(returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Greater than or equal&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Retruns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; if left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;code&gt;x &amp;gt; 5&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt;(returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Less than&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; if the left operand is less than the right operand&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;code&gt;x &amp;lt; 8&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt;(returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Less than or equal&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;code&gt;x &amp;lt;= 8&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt;(returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For equal comparison, we use the &lt;strong&gt;equal operator&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;(==)&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;strict equal operator&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;(===)&lt;/code&gt;. Why do we need two different operators for equal comparison? Let's find out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are different data types in JavaScript. When comparing two values of different types, JavaScript tries to convert these different data types into one data type. We call this &lt;strong&gt;type coercion&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, let's say you have to compare a string with a number; JavaScript will try to convert the string into a number or the number into a string so that the values can be compared. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can try the below code and see for yourself.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Addition&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// '111'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Subtraction&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the above example, when &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; are added together, JavaScript thinks it is string concatenation and converts the value of the &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; into a string, and concatenate &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;. So the output becomes a string, &lt;code&gt;'111'&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, when subtracting, JavaScript thinks it's an arithmetic operation so it converts everything into numbers and outputs the value as number &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it's pretty strange! 😂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jmFT_SeC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634698355344/QYOCs26Di.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jmFT_SeC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634698355344/QYOCs26Di.jpeg" alt="type-con.jpg" width="828" height="668"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This topic requires a dedicated post itself. But let's try to get a basic idea of type coercion to understand the difference between equal and strict equal comparison. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is how the &lt;strong&gt;equal operator&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;(==)&lt;/code&gt; compares operands:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, it converts the value of the operands to a common type, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then checks for the equality between them, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then compares them and returns the boolean value. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it looks like the equal operator doesn't consider the data type when comparing the two values. JavaScript actually first converts the values to the same data type implicitly and then compares the operands. Check the below example to understand this behavior.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//true&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;strict equal operator&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;(===)&lt;/code&gt; compares both values and value types. It returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; only if both values and data types match with the other operand. Check the below example to understand this behavior.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//true&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now you understand how equal comparison works. This same logic applies to &lt;strong&gt;not equal&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;strict not equal&lt;/strong&gt; comparisons. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's move on to logical operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#logical-operators"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Logical Operators
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use logical operators to decide the logic between two variables or values. So it evaluates them and checks whether multiple conditions are &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;, then returns a boolean value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let's see what are the logical operators and then understand how this basic boolean logic works. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Operator Name&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Symbol&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Example&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Logical AND&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; if both the operands are &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, else returns &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;code&gt;true &amp;amp;&amp;amp; true&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt;(returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;), &lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;true &amp;amp;&amp;amp; false&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt;(returns &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Logical OR&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;| |&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; if either of the operands is &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;; returns &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; if both are &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; | | &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt;(returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;), &lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; | | &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt;(returns &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Logical NOT&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; if the operand is &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; and vice-versa.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;code&gt;!true&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt;(returns &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;) &lt;code&gt;!false&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt;(returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's see how this boolean logic actually works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check the below picture: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rFwSlV40--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634698402709/M-rCqGBzA.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rFwSlV40--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634698402709/M-rCqGBzA.png" alt="boolean-logic.png" width="880" height="568"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above picture, we have two boolean variables that can be either true or false.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A: Sarah loves coffee &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;B: Coffee cup is empty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now using the boolean operator, we can combine these two variables and use them to make a decision. For example, if Sarah loves coffee and the coffee cup is empty, then we can fill Sarah's coffee cup ☕️&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can use the truth table in the above picture to quickly calculate the result of the AND and OR operators. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if we are using the AND &lt;code&gt;(&amp;amp;&amp;amp;)&lt;/code&gt; logical operator, if all the operands are true, the result would be true. Else, even if one operand is false, then the result would be false. Check the below example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sarahLovesCoffee&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// A&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;coffeeCupIsEmpty&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// B&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sarahLovesCoffee&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;coffeeCupIsEmpty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When using the OR &lt;code&gt;(||)&lt;/code&gt; logical operator, the result would be true even if one operand is true, even though the other operands are false. But, if all the operands are false, then the result would be false.  Check the below example.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//At least one operand is true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sarahLovesCoffee&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// A&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;coffeeCupIsEmpty&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// B&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sarahLovesCoffee&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;coffeeCupIsEmpty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// true&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Both operands are false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sarahLovesCoffee&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// A&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;coffeeCupIsEmpty&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// B&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sarahLovesCoffee&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;coffeeCupIsEmpty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the logical NOT &lt;code&gt;(!)&lt;/code&gt; operator, it inverts the boolean result of the operand (or condition). Check the below example to understand this better.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sarahLovesCoffee&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// A&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;coffeeCupIsEmpty&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// B&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sarahLovesCoffee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;coffeeCupIsEmpty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here's Drake's version of the logic gates 😂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zm9zpZBb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634698428500/tjbirw3q1y.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zm9zpZBb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634698428500/tjbirw3q1y.png" alt="drake-boolean.png" width="880" height="308"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that now you understand the basics of logical operators. So let's move on to ternary operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ternary-operators"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Ternary Operators
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ternary operator or the conditional operator allows us to write something similar to an if-else statement, but all in one line. It uses three operands and evaluates if a condition is true or false, and then returns one of the two values. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is the syntax for the ternary operator:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;condition&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;expressionIfTrue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;expressionIfFalse&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, according to the above syntax, If the condition is true, the first expression will be executed. Otherwise, the second expression will be executed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say that you want to check the age before deciding whether you are eligible to drive or not. You can simply write it as below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;can drive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;can't drive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So if the age 18 or above, then the first expression &lt;code&gt;"can drive"&lt;/code&gt; is executed. Else the second expression &lt;code&gt;"can't drive"&lt;/code&gt; is executed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, remember that an operator always produces a value.  In other words, an operator is an expression. So if we have a value, we can assign that value to a variable. Because of that, we can make a ternary operator useful to assign a value to a variable conditionally. So we can store the above expression in a variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check the below example.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;eligibleToDrive&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;can drive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;can't drive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;eligibleToDrive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// "can drive"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's see what we have done here;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have declared a variable called &lt;code&gt;age&lt;/code&gt; and given the value of &lt;code&gt;24&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then, we have declared a variable to check the eligibility to drive - &lt;code&gt;eligibleToDrive&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then, we have assigned the ternary operator as the value for the &lt;code&gt;eligibleToDrive&lt;/code&gt; variable. In this ternary operator we have given the condition as &lt;code&gt;age &amp;gt;= 18&lt;/code&gt;, the first value as &lt;code&gt;"can drive"&lt;/code&gt; (which will be executed if the condition is true), and the second value as &lt;code&gt;"can't drive"&lt;/code&gt; (which will be executed if the condition is false).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When we console log the variable, &lt;code&gt;eligibleToDrive&lt;/code&gt;,  it prints the first expression from the ternary operator because the age is greater than 18. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the ternary operator is just a single line of code, it's often used as a shortened version of a simple if-else statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that's about the ternary operator! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-typeof-endraw-operator"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;typeof&lt;/code&gt; Operator
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;typeof&lt;/code&gt; operator can tell us about which data type a variable contains. Whether the value is a string, number, boolean, etc. It returns a string indicating the data type. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let's print a few values to see their types.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;             &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 'boolean'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 'boolean'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Peter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 'string'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;300&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;              &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 'number'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;NaN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;              &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 'number'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;Infinity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 'number'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;John&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 'object'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the above example, with the &lt;code&gt;typeof&lt;/code&gt; operator, we can check the data type of each value. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Okay, we made it to the end! 😂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all about the basics of JavaScript operators. Of course, there are more to these operators and more operators out there, but you can easily get through them when you understand these basics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading this very long beginner's guide to the end!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy coding! 🤗&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Getting hired after finishing a coding bootcamp</title>
      <author>SinnerSchrader Engineers</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 09:51:59 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/s2engineers/getting-hired-after-finishing-a-coding-bootcamp-3fga</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/s2engineers/getting-hired-after-finishing-a-coding-bootcamp-3fga</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was written by Sandra Gläsner (Director Product Engineering).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you've decided to reshape your career and successfully completed a coding bootcamp, you're probably now facing the challenge of finding your first job in a completely new field. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd like to briefly share my experience as a team lead who has had an increased number of applications from bootcamp graduates on her screen over the past few months. Maybe you can take something from this for your future applications and interviews. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-tell-your-career-story"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Tell your career story
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his resume, an applicant (now colleague) once added a short statement to each of his previous job stations about what his motivation was. This created a coherent picture of what drives him and made it easy for me to understand why he developed his career the way he did. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your decision to take a new career path in (web) development will definitely not have been made on a whim. Find the common thread that underlies your decision and tell your very personal story. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-reflect-your-personal-strengths-and-interests"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Reflect your personal strengths and interests
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of you have learned the same content in the same short amount of time. I have seen many practical final projects that were very similar in terms of implementation. This is because of the nature of bootcamps, which usually teach a specific, narrow curriculum. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that makes it very difficult for me to distinguish between the different applicants and their strengths. And this is where your personal experiences come into play: tell me why you chose this masterpiece, what you had difficulties with, or what you found particularly easy and had fun with. Maybe you liked the setup of build and deployment pipelines more than everything else? Cool! Or did you fall in love with the styling part? Wonderful! Or did you spend much time on finding out what best practices are used in terms of web accessibility? Nice, tell me more! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflect your learning path and where your strengths and interests lie. &lt;br&gt;
And finally… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-decide-what-you-want-to-learn-next"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Decide what you want (to learn next)
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bootcamp can always be just a start. Think about what you have been missing in the bootcamp or what you would like to learn more about. Please don't be afraid of the vast amounts of knowledge you think you still lack. Be patient with yourself and take one step at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to write a promising CV</title>
      <author>Julia Undeutsch</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 09:38:31 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/yuridevat/how-to-write-a-promising-cv-32ih</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/yuridevat/how-to-write-a-promising-cv-32ih</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was first published on &lt;a href="https://community.codenewbie.org/yuridevat/how-to-write-a-promising-cv-3dlm"&gt;CodeNewbie&lt;/a&gt; on Sept 26, 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 weeks ago, I landed my first job as a front-end developer in the tech industry after a year of self-study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it came to writing my resume, I watched pretty much every video about writing a good resume on LinkedIn Learning, talked to professional IT recruiters, and looked at the resumes of people who successfully applied to Google, Facebook, and the like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And these are the tips that overlap with all of these that I've stuck to and that landed me my first job as a front-end developer this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They taught me that a hiring manager only looks at a resume for 10 to 20 seconds before sorting it into a yes or no stack, an AI program takes even less. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So they shared some tips and helpful advice to avoid being set aside too soon, and here's what they all had in common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tips-for-a-promising-cv"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tips for a promising CV
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#singlepage"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Single-page
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start with the important information, because most likely the recruiter will not read your resume to the end.To keep the resume one-page, include only the information that is important for the job and leave out unnecessary parts as long as there are no big gaps in between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#keep-it-simple"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Keep it simple
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple design was the hardest for me, I admit I like it colorful and fancy. But unless you are applying to be a graphic designer, keep the resume as simple as possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may think that a fancy resume is more memorable, but in reality, it's much harder to read because the recruiter has to flip back and forth to find the information they need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it's best to keep your resume black and white, avoid the usage of different font sizes (it's better if everything is the same size), and list your experience in one column rather than two or three. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to leave no gaps (blank space) in your resume and use all the space available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CiR0gw-a--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://community.codenewbie.org/remoteimages/uploads/articles/8cb2twog8163317vna34.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CiR0gw-a--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://community.codenewbie.org/remoteimages/uploads/articles/8cb2twog8163317vna34.png" alt='"Be boring in layout but creative and informative in content"' width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-to-write-when-you-have-no-experience"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What to write when you have no experience
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you may be thinking, what should I use to fill in gaps if I have nothing to add?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is: add supplementary comments, write what exactly was done, and create at least three bullet points per experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can list any experience you had: Volunteering, working on an open source project, a university project, an internship, and write what exactly was done and what languages and tools were used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--y1ttKcRE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://community.codenewbie.org/remoteimages/uploads/articles/2ygvhe2pa2dc3tx0dmmn.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--y1ttKcRE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://community.codenewbie.org/remoteimages/uploads/articles/2ygvhe2pa2dc3tx0dmmn.png" alt="&amp;quot;Fake it 'till you make it&amp;quot;" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't "really" fake it, of course. But list positive things, even if an internship wasn't that interesting or educational. It is allowed to embellish your experience a little bit or to prettify a boring experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#specify-exactly-which-languages-and-tools-you-have-used"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Specify exactly which languages and tools you have used
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important that you list all the languages and tools you have used for each project in detail. If the recruiter is looking for a Python developer and Python is nowhere to be found on your resume, your resume will fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if you list projects at the university, write what languages, etc were used in them. This way, the recruiter can't miss that you know Python, for example, if it's more common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-to-write-first"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What to write first
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always put important things at the beginning. Usually, you start your resume with information about your education. And that's perfectly fine if you have a CS degree. (Because that's something a recruiter would look for).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case, I started with my programming skills first because neither my education nor my previous jobs had anything to do with technology and I wanted to pique the recruiter's interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-else-to-include-in-a-resume"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What else to include in a resume
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include your grades if you did well, or your overall average if you have not yet graduated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can also include the expected date of your graduation (University, a Nano degree program, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perhaps write a new resume for all applications so you can highlight the languages that are currently required. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal interests can also be included in the resume. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#and-here-is-my-cv"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  And here is my CV
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created my resume with &lt;a href="https://flowcv.io/"&gt;flowCV&lt;/a&gt;, but you can choose any tool you like best. (e.g. &lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/"&gt;Canva&lt;/a&gt;, Google Docs, Microsoft Word, to name a few).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm showing only one page of my resume here, because the second one contains only one additional item, namely the work as an assistant, which is not relevant in this case but had to be included it to avoid a big gap of four years in my experience. As you know by now, you should limit yourself to one page if possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My resume was revised by a professional recruiter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nYjijHoA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://community.codenewbie.org/remoteimages/uploads/articles/broc2es655b8rj92d41c.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nYjijHoA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://community.codenewbie.org/remoteimages/uploads/articles/broc2es655b8rj92d41c.png" alt="CV example" width="880" height="1260"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great thing about flowCV is that you can easily link to your social media accounts by adding the URL link. So the PDF is clickable and automatically takes you to the correct URL. Also, the little icons next to my projects are clickable and open the URL to the GitHub code. A must for a resume these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks for your reading and time. I really appreciate it!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JavaScript 4 Ways To Create Function</title>
      <author>Jenuel Oras Ganawed</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 09:37:40 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/brojenuel/javascript-4-ways-to-create-function-453g</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/brojenuel/javascript-4-ways-to-create-function-453g</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;First we have the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;Function Declaration&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. This is mostly common way to create a function as shown in the bellow example. What good about this is you can use the function even if the function is declared on the very bottom of your codes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;addTwoNumbers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;num1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;num2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;num1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;num2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addTwoNumbers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// outputs: 11&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;Function Expression&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a function were you asign a function in a variable. Function assigned to a variable needs to be declared on top before using the function.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addTwoNumbers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Error, becayse cant find addTwo Numbers&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;addTwoNumbers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;num1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;num2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;num1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;num2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addTwoNumbers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// outputs: 11&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;Arrow Function Expression&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, this function is like a functional expression but instead of writing &lt;code&gt;function&lt;/code&gt; we use arrows &lt;code&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; instead.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;addTwoNumbers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;num1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;num2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;num1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;num2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addTwoNumbers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// outputs: 11&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;Concised Arrow Function Expression&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, is a function were you can directly return without writing a return statement. &lt;code&gt;note: only works if It will directly return a value&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;addTwoNumbers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;num1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;num2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;num1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;num2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addTwoNumbers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// outputs: 11&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When working on any .NET application, one of the most common things you'll see is using dependency injection to inject an &lt;code&gt;IHttpClientFactory&lt;/code&gt; instance into the constructor of a service. And, of course, you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; test that service. To write good unit tests, it is a good practice to mock the dependencies to have full control over their behavior. A well-known library to mock dependencies is &lt;strong&gt;Moq&lt;/strong&gt;; integrating it is pretty simple: if you have to mock a dependency of type &lt;code&gt;IMyService&lt;/code&gt;, you can create mocks of it by using &lt;code&gt;Mock&amp;lt;IMyService&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here comes a problem: mocking &lt;code&gt;IHttpClientFactory&lt;/code&gt; is not that simple: just using &lt;code&gt;Mock&amp;lt;IHttpClientFactory&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is not enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we will learn how to mock &lt;code&gt;IHttpClientFactory&lt;/code&gt; dependencies, how to define the behavior for HTTP calls, and finally, we will deep dive into the advanced features of Moq that allow us to mock that dependency. Let's go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introducing-the-issue"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introducing the issue
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fully understand the problem, we need a concrete example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following class implements a service with a method that, given an input string, sends it to a remote client using a DELETE HTTP call:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;MyExternalService&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;readonly&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;IHttpClientFactory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_httpClientFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;MyExternalService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;IHttpClientFactory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;httpClientFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;_httpClientFactory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;httpClientFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Task&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;DeleteObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;objectName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kt"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;$"/objects?name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;objectName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kt"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_httpClientFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;CreateClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"ext_service"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="kt"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;httpResponse&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;DeleteAsync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;httpResponse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;EnsureSuccessStatusCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The key point to notice is that we are injecting an instance of &lt;code&gt;IHttpClientFactory&lt;/code&gt;; we are also creating a new &lt;code&gt;HttpClient&lt;/code&gt; every time it's needed by using &lt;code&gt;_httpClientFactory.CreateClient("ext_service")&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may know, you should not instantiate new &lt;code&gt;HttpClient&lt;/code&gt; objects every time to avoid the risk of &lt;strong&gt;socket exhaustion&lt;/strong&gt; (see &lt;a href="#further-readings"&gt;links below&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a huge problem with this approach: it's not easy to test it. You cannot simply mock the &lt;code&gt;IHttpClientFactory&lt;/code&gt; dependency, but you have to manually handle the &lt;code&gt;HttpClient&lt;/code&gt; and keep track of its internals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, we will not use real &lt;code&gt;IHttpClientFactory&lt;/code&gt; instances: we don't want our application to perform real HTTP calls. We need to mock that dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of mocked dependencies as movies stunt doubles: you don't want your main stars to get hurt while performing action scenes. In the same way, you don't want your application to perform actual operations when running tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sz9EzvWs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.code4it.dev/static/368a64e54d8c8ba705805308dba6c235/29d31/marvel-stunt-doubles.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sz9EzvWs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.code4it.dev/static/368a64e54d8c8ba705805308dba6c235/29d31/marvel-stunt-doubles.jpg" alt="Creating mocks is like [using stunt doubles](https://www.boredpanda.com/marvel-avengers-actors-stunt-doubles) for action scenes" title="Marvel actors with their stunt doubles" width="700" height="368"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will use &lt;strong&gt;Moq&lt;/strong&gt; to test the method and check that the HTTP call is correctly adding the &lt;code&gt;objectName&lt;/code&gt; variable in the query string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-create-mocks-of-ihttpclientfactory-with-moq"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to create mocks of IHttpClientFactory with Moq
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's begin with the full code for the creation of mocked &lt;code&gt;IHttpClientFactory&lt;/code&gt;s:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;handlerMock&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HttpMessageHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MockBehavior&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Strict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;HttpResponseMessage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;HttpResponseMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;handlerMock&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Protected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Task&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HttpResponseMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;"SendAsync"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;ItExpr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;IsAny&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HttpRequestMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;ItExpr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;IsAny&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;CancellationToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;ReturnsAsync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Verifiable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kt"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;httpClient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;HttpClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;handlerMock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; 
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;BaseAddress&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Uri&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://www.code4it.dev/"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kt"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mockHttpClientFactory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;IHttpClientFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;mockHttpClientFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;CreateClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"ext_service"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Returns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;httpClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;service&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;MyExternalService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mockHttpClientFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A lot of stuff is going on, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's break it down to fully understand what all those statements mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#mocking-httpmessagehandler"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Mocking HttpMessageHandler
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first instruction we meet is&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;handlerMock&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HttpMessageHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MockBehavior&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Strict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What does it mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;HttpMessageHandler&lt;/code&gt; is the fundamental part of every HTTP request in .NET: it performs a &lt;strong&gt;SendAsync&lt;/strong&gt; call to the specified endpoint with all the info defined in a &lt;code&gt;HttpRequestMessage&lt;/code&gt; object passed as a parameter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we are interested in what happens to the &lt;code&gt;HttpMessageHandler&lt;/code&gt;, we need to mock it and store the result in a variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noticed that &lt;code&gt;MockBehavior.Strict&lt;/code&gt;? This is an &lt;em&gt;optional&lt;/em&gt; parameter that makes the mock throw an exception when it doesn't have a corresponding setup. To try it, remove that argument to the constructor and comment out the &lt;code&gt;handlerMock.Setup()&lt;/code&gt; part: when you'll run the tests, you'll receive an error of type &lt;code&gt;Moq.MockException&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next step: defining the behavior of the mocked &lt;code&gt;HttpMessageHandler&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#defining-the-behavior-of-httpmessagehandler"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Defining the behavior of HttpMessageHandler
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have to define what happens when we use the &lt;code&gt;handlerMock&lt;/code&gt; object in any HTTP operation:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HttpResponseMessage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;HttpResponseMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;handlerMock&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Protected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Task&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HttpResponseMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;"SendAsync"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;ItExpr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;IsAny&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HttpRequestMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;ItExpr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;IsAny&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;CancellationToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;ReturnsAsync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Verifiable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first thing we meet is that &lt;code&gt;Protected()&lt;/code&gt;. Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fully understand why we need it, and what is the meaning of the next operations, we need to have a look at the definition of &lt;code&gt;HttpMessageHandler&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Summary: A base type for HTTP message handlers.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;abstract&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;HttpMessageHandler&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;IDisposable&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;/// Other stuff here...&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Summary: Send an HTTP request as an asynchronous operation.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;protected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;internal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;abstract&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Task&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HttpResponseMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;SendAsync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;HttpRequestMessage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;CancellationToken&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cancellationToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From this snippet, we can see that we have a method, &lt;code&gt;SendAsync&lt;/code&gt;, which accepts an &lt;code&gt;HttpRequestMessage&lt;/code&gt; object and a &lt;code&gt;CancellationToken&lt;/code&gt;, and which is the one that deals with HTTP requests. &lt;strong&gt;But this method is protected&lt;/strong&gt;. Therefore we need to use &lt;code&gt;Protected()&lt;/code&gt; to access the protected methods of the &lt;code&gt;HttpMessageHandler&lt;/code&gt; class, and we must set them up by using the method name and the parameters in the &lt;code&gt;Setup&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--noAtrvVy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.code4it.dev/static/6c69938aa13945de0fe33096cd9dd1c6/eda93/mr-turner-protected.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--noAtrvVy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.code4it.dev/static/6c69938aa13945de0fe33096cd9dd1c6/eda93/mr-turner-protected.jpg" alt="With Protected() you can access protected members" width="573" height="436"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two details to notice, then:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We specify the method to set up by using its name as a string: &lt;em&gt;"SendAsync"&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To say that we don't care about the actual values of the parameters, we use &lt;code&gt;ItExpr&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;It&lt;/code&gt; because we are dealing with the setup of a &lt;em&gt;protected&lt;/em&gt; member.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If SendAsync was a public method, we would have done something like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;handlerMock&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;SendAsync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;It&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;IsAny&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HttpRequestMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;It&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;IsAny&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;CancellationToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;())&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But, since it is a protected method, we need to use the way I listed before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, we define that the call to &lt;code&gt;SendAsync&lt;/code&gt; returns an object of type &lt;code&gt;HttpResponseMessage&lt;/code&gt;: here we don't care about the content of the response, so we can leave it in this way without further customizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-httpclient"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating HttpClient
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have defined the behavior of the &lt;code&gt;HttpMessageHandler&lt;/code&gt; object, we can pass it to the &lt;code&gt;HttpClient&lt;/code&gt; constructor to create a new instance of &lt;code&gt;HttpClient&lt;/code&gt; that acts as we need.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;httpClient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;HttpClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;handlerMock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; 
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;BaseAddress&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Uri&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://www.code4it.dev/"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here I've set up the value of the &lt;code&gt;BaseAddress&lt;/code&gt; property to a valid URI to avoid null references when performing the HTTP call. You can use even non existing URL: the important thing is that the URL must be well-formed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#configuring-the-ihttpclientfactory-instance"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Configuring the IHttpClientFactory instance
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are finally ready to create the &lt;code&gt;IHttpClientFactory&lt;/code&gt;!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mockHttpClientFactory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;IHttpClientFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;mockHttpClientFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;CreateClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"ext_service"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Returns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;httpClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kt"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;service&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;MyExternalService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mockHttpClientFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, we create the Mock of &lt;code&gt;IHttpClientFactory&lt;/code&gt; and define the instance of &lt;code&gt;HttpClient&lt;/code&gt; that will be returned when calling &lt;code&gt;CreateClient("ext_service")&lt;/code&gt;. Finally, we're passing the instance of &lt;code&gt;IHttpClientFactory&lt;/code&gt; to the constructor of &lt;code&gt;MyExternalService&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-verify-the-calls-performed-by-ihttpclientfactory"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to verify the calls performed by IHttpClientFactory
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, suppose that in our test we've performed the operation under test.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// setup IHttpClientFactory&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;DeleteObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"my-name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How can we check if the &lt;code&gt;HttpClient&lt;/code&gt; actually called an endpoint with "my-name" in the query string? As before, let's look at the whole code, and then let's analyze every part of it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// verify that the query string contains "my-name"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;handlerMock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Protected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Verify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;"SendAsync"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Exactly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// we expected a single external request&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;ItExpr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HttpRequestMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;RequestUri&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Contains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"my-name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Query string contains my-name&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;ItExpr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;IsAny&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;CancellationToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#accessing-the-protected-instance"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Accessing the protected instance
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we've already seen, the object that performs the HTTP operation is the  &lt;code&gt;HttpMessageHandler&lt;/code&gt;, which here we've mocked and stored in the &lt;code&gt;handlerMock&lt;/code&gt; variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we need to verify what happened when calling the &lt;code&gt;SendAsync&lt;/code&gt; method, which is a protected method; thus we use &lt;code&gt;Protected&lt;/code&gt; to access that member.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#checking-the-query-string"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Checking the query string
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core part of our assertion is this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ItExpr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HttpRequestMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;RequestUri&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Contains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"my-name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Query string contains my-name&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Again, we are accessing a &lt;code&gt;protected&lt;/code&gt; member, so we need to use &lt;code&gt;ItExpr&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;It&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Is&amp;lt;HttpRequestMessage&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; method accepts a function &lt;code&gt;Func&amp;lt;HttpRequestMessage, bool&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; that we can use to determine if a property of the &lt;code&gt;HttpRequestMessage&lt;/code&gt; under test - in our case, we named that variable as &lt;code&gt;req&lt;/code&gt; - matches the specified predicate. If so, the test passes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#refactoring-the-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Refactoring the code
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine having to repeat that code for every test method in your class - what a mess!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we can refactor it: first of all, we can move the &lt;code&gt;HttpMessageHandler&lt;/code&gt;  mock to the &lt;code&gt;SetUp&lt;/code&gt; method:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SetUp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;handlerMock&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HttpMessageHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MockBehavior&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Strict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;HttpResponseMessage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;HttpResponseMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;handlerMock&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Protected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Task&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HttpResponseMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;"SendAsync"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;ItExpr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;IsAny&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HttpRequestMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;ItExpr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;IsAny&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;CancellationToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Returns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Task&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;FromResult&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Verifiable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kt"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;httpClient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;HttpClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;handlerMock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; 
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;BaseAddress&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Uri&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://www.code4it.dev/"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kt"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mockHttpClientFactory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;IHttpClientFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;mockHttpClientFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;CreateClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"ext_service"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Returns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;httpClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;service&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;MyExternalService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mockHttpClientFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;and keep a reference to &lt;code&gt;handlerMock&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;service&lt;/code&gt; in some private members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, we can move the &lt;em&gt;assertion&lt;/em&gt; part to a different method, maybe to an extension method:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Verify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HttpMessageHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HttpRequestMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Protected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Verify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;"SendAsync"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Exactly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// we expected a single external request&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;ItExpr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HttpRequestMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;ItExpr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;IsAny&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;CancellationToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So that our test can be simplified to just a bunch of lines:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Task&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Method_Should_ReturnSomething_When_Condition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Arrange occurs in the SetUp phase&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Act&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;DeleteObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"my-name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Assert&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;handlerMock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Verify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;RequestUri&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Contains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"my-name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Wrapping up
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we've seen how tricky it can be to test services that rely on &lt;code&gt;IHttpClientFactory&lt;/code&gt; instances. Luckily, we can rely on tools like Moq to mock the dependencies and have full control over the behavior of those dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mocking &lt;code&gt;IHttpClientFactory&lt;/code&gt; is hard, I know. But here we've found a way to overcome those difficulties and make our tests easy to write and to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of NuGet packages out there that help us mocking that dependency: do you use any of them? What is your favourite, and why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy coding!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🐧&lt;/p&gt;
