      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another busy week gone by, and somehow your to-do list was neglected once again! Your tasks are adding up way faster than you can check them off, and as much as you need a quiet week to catch up, there isn't one on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while you and your team are super busy, it doesn't always translate to being productive. The problem with busy work culture is that it's all too easy to get caught up in other people's priorities. Suddenly your calendar is slammed with all types of meetings - group updates, brainstorming meetings, and information sharing sessions, which leaves you little to no time for your actual work! What's worse, each distraction just eats further away at your productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes an average of &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicolebendaly/2020/05/10/digital-distractions-are-hurting-your-team-three-things-you-can-do/?sh=6120ad276cb7"&gt;23 minutes and 15 seconds&lt;/a&gt; to get back on track after being interrupted from a task according to Gloria Mark, Professor at the University of California, Irvine. That's almost 5% of your entire workday! You can see how just a few interruptions can quickly eat away at your productivity. So if you're interrupted three times, 15% of your day quickly becomes getting back on task, but on a bad day, you might be interrupted a dozen or more times, and suddenly over half of your time is gone. That is, until you reclaim some of that focus time back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://reclaim.ai/blog/what-is-focus-time?utm_source=devto&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog-published&amp;amp;utm_campaign=what-is-focus-time&amp;amp;utm_term="&gt;In this post&lt;/a&gt;, learn how to create focus time in your busy schedule to make real progress on your priorities and improve your overall productivity every week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-focus-time"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is focus time?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focus time is a dedicated block of time that you set aside for productive work on a task or project, without interruption. This time management strategy allows you to prioritize the important work that requires your undivided attention so you can actually produce high quality results. Regardless of whether you're a manager or maker, or need to spend time writing, coding, designing, or researching, making time on your calendar for heads-down work will not only help you get it done, but done faster with less room for interruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-is-it-important"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why is it important?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focus time is important because it allows you to dedicate your full attention to the task at hand without the added distraction of meetings or interruptions. Oftentimes, you find yourself splitting your focus on two or more tasks at once, or multitasking, and that can come at the expense of missing details, deadlines, or a critical task altogether. By adopting a focus time routine, you're able to increase your efficiency and quality of work with a &lt;a href="https://reclaim.ai/blog/single-tasking"&gt;single-tasking&lt;/a&gt; approach towards your to-do list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you well know, one of the biggest challenges of navigating a busy workweek is actually finding the time to enter a productive state of deep work. After all, it's hard when your attention is constantly being fought over by the many workday distractions, or low-value tasks that can pile up and quickly overwhelm an afternoon. By giving yourself time to actually get into your groove, you enter a flow state where everything is clicking and you're able to make significant progress on your work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#top-work-distractions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Top work distractions
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focus time is used to combat distractions throughout your workday - here are the top work distractions that most professionals are working around:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scattered meetings: The average middle manager spends &lt;a href="https://blog.otter.ai/meeting-statistics/"&gt;35% of their time&lt;/a&gt; in meetings, and up to 50% for upper management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slack interruptions: The average Slack user spends &lt;a href="https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/blog/news/intl-en-gb-work-is-fuelled-by-true-engagement"&gt;90 minutes per working day&lt;/a&gt; reading, writing, commenting and searching in Slack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social media &amp;amp; news sites: The average employee spends &lt;a href="https://theundercoverrecruiter.com/infographic-how-much-time-do-you-waste-social-networks/"&gt;12% of their work day&lt;/a&gt; using unproductive sites, like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Email: The average employee spends &lt;a href="https://ppm.express/blog/how-much-time-your-employees-spend-on-checking-emails/"&gt;28% of their work day&lt;/a&gt; on email, and checks their email 11 times per hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multitasking rabbit holes: The average employee receives up to &lt;a href="https://www.concur.com/newsroom/article/how-workplace-distractions-and-multitasking-hurt-employee-productivity-and-focus"&gt;200 notifications a day&lt;/a&gt;, causing task-switching and disengagement from their core work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#focus-time-benefits"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Focus time benefits
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how does focus time help you combat the constant flood of workday interruptions? By giving you the permission you need to disengage from distractions and focus on the work you need to get done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give your brain the opportunity to settle into a task, entering a &lt;a href="https://reclaim.ai/blog/cant-focus-at-work"&gt;productive state of flow&lt;/a&gt; for deep work, so you can be up to 500% more productive on your project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prevent interruptions that cause you to &lt;a href="https://reclaim.ai/blog/context-switching"&gt;context switch&lt;/a&gt;, our tendency to jump between one unrelated project to another, so you can avoid catching up after you've been pulled away from a task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work faster by focusing on one thing at a time, or &lt;a href="https://reclaim.ai/blog/single-tasking"&gt;single tasking&lt;/a&gt;, so you don't slow your brain down by trying to multitask through complex problems and projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prioritizing your important work during your actual working hours so you can eliminate the need to work overtime, helping to prevent yourself from experiencing &lt;a href="https://reclaim.ai/blog/workplace-burnout"&gt;workplace burnout&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When your calendar is filled with meetings every other hour, and Slack and email catch up in-between, you're forced to constantly context switch, which can prevent you from even opening up your to-do list on any given day. With the average middle manager spending 35% of their time in meetings, another 5% getting back on track after each, and then 28% catching up on email, you're not left with a lot of time for productive work. These distractions are some of the key reasons why focus time matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-does-it-work"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How does it work?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how should you structure your focus time? A good way to think about it is by the types of tasks you need to get done, and their level of difficulty. Cal Newport, productivity expert and author of &lt;a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/"&gt;Deep Work&lt;/a&gt;, pioneered a new way of focusing your work sessions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shallow Work: This is your non-cognitively demanding logistical work like email, slack, and quick tasks that can be performed while distracted, and usually done in short working sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep Work: These sessions consist of your cognitively demanding work dedicated to your true priorities, requiring deep thinking without distraction so you can push your brainpower to its limits, usually performed in longer working sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how much time should you spend on each? This very much depends on your role, but most importantly, it's about doing them right. Bundle all of your shallow work together so it's not slowing or blocking anything during your deep work sessions. And try to set yourself up for as much deep work as you can! Realistically, the brain can't do more than &lt;a href="https://www.theladders.com/career-advice/you-cant-do-deep-work-for-more-than-4-hours-per-day"&gt;4 hours of deep work&lt;/a&gt; per day, so if you have the time in your role, set that as the "most aggressive" goal for cognitively demanding work on your calendar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also many different &lt;a href="https://reclaim.ai/blog/time-blocking-planner"&gt;time blocking methods&lt;/a&gt; you can try to optimize your focus time, like the Pomodoro technique which works by setting a series of timers to give yourself frequent breaks during a focus time session. You work for 25 minutes, give yourself a 5-minute break, and repeat 4 times for a 30-minute reward break after 2 hours. Or, if you have a few big projects or responsibilities on your plate, you could try day-theming to target a focus for each day of the week. Task batching is another useful process which groups similar, quick low-value tasks together for your shallow work so you can cruise through your deep work focus sessions without those distractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look, there are a lot of methods, but don't let that distract you from just making time for it any way you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#focus-time-best-practices"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Focus time best practices
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned above, the most important way to get focus time is to actually schedule it on your calendar -- but is it really that easy in practice? Unfortunately not. Here are some of the major why people aren't blocking time for focus time on their calendars regularly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time blocks are inflexible and static. Something changes, and you now have more work to do in rescheduling your focus time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time blocks make you unavailable for meetings, which in many roles and organizations, is just not realistic. This often creates more work because people have to ping you to find time. Bleh!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time blocks aren't intentional enough. You block time, then you struggle with what to do with it, and ultimately end up getting lost in your to-do list and start multitasking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interruptions still happen. If your Slack is going off every 5 seconds and your phone is buzzing with social media notifications, your time block ain't gonna help you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are steps to make this process way simpler to approach and easy implement into your regular work routine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#plan-your-time"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Plan your time
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step is of course finding the time, but it will quickly go to waste if you don't have a solid action plan for how you're going to focus on and prioritize your work. Without a plan, it's all too easy to get caught up clearing your email, checking updates, or just poking around your task list without knowing what to focus on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focus time needs to be intentional! If your time blocks aren't intentional, then prioritizing them is really hard. While some tools like &lt;a href="https://reclaim.ai/blog/clockwise-vs-reclaim"&gt;Clockwise&lt;/a&gt; will help you block fixed slots without meetings, these time blocks don't help you determine what to do with this time. Reclaim on the other hand, blocks out time that is specific to the tasks you need to accomplish, giving you a clearer view of what's on your plate and how long you need to get through your most important to-dos. These assigned blocks of time will also help you stay on task, and prevent you from bouncing aimlessly from one thing to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Yxn7cuvS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Aux3A37qhEYFq_fRlfdODn5FYhZRravhyMYDU55r7XH552zJbkISQhi9NsQeMq2VAYMjAyB-aDLk1cLxvPXbtfUODGAHa7sjfNKh8EK5lblvpoStPCUyW1uJ2M8wJG7AqQGHLI7q%3Ds0" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Yxn7cuvS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Aux3A37qhEYFq_fRlfdODn5FYhZRravhyMYDU55r7XH552zJbkISQhi9NsQeMq2VAYMjAyB-aDLk1cLxvPXbtfUODGAHa7sjfNKh8EK5lblvpoStPCUyW1uJ2M8wJG7AqQGHLI7q%3Ds0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prevent-interruptions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Prevent interruptions
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slack is a great tool, but it's also one of the worst offenders for interruption. On average, employees at large companies are each sending more than &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/1/18511575/productivity-slack-google-microsoft-facebook"&gt;200 Slack messages per week&lt;/a&gt;! One tool that people use to prevent interruptions in Slack is setting their status, and specifically setting do not disturb / DND. The challenge? Keeping your status up-to-date is another thing you have to remember to do, and you don't want to necessarily be uninterruptible all of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, you can use tools like Reclaim to automatically &lt;a href="https://reclaim.ai/features/slack-integration"&gt;sync your Slack status&lt;/a&gt; to your calendar, customize your status by event type, and auto-set DND for events you really can't be interrupted in. There are other integrations like Google Calendar for Slack that works similarly, but the only status it will sync is "In a meeting", and doesn't sync shared calendar events, or allow you to automate DND. So, if you're working through an important focus time session and need to harvest 100% of your brainpower to meet a deadline, DND is what you need to block the non-stop flood of Slack messages so you're not pulled out of deep work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--76GYHXk7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/mTSKKmO_RsPQwNQT5E9kH0ZQjKWiIJg0oMDT6Ende1lITUySds2HOyL6c9rCcNvd6WOzwbcTldYPKVexxCrhrMaMqQuwCZqKNWShOKNGhGWIEkkdv_Uhd3yIxslO2U1EvFUqBRFa%3Ds0" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--76GYHXk7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/mTSKKmO_RsPQwNQT5E9kH0ZQjKWiIJg0oMDT6Ende1lITUySds2HOyL6c9rCcNvd6WOzwbcTldYPKVexxCrhrMaMqQuwCZqKNWShOKNGhGWIEkkdv_Uhd3yIxslO2U1EvFUqBRFa%3Ds0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So while interruptions can be difficult to prevent, you can defend yourself by anticipating them ahead of time. First being to communicate context around what you are working on. While a basic "focus time" block on your calendar may just be construed as time not spent in meetings (and totally interruptible), your colleagues will think twice before they try to steal your time during a "Write important strategy plan" or "Troubleshoot critical bug" time block on your calendar. By the simple act of communicating through an event title, you are sharing your priorities with your team, defending your focus time, and increasing the weight of their decision on imposing their own priorities to interrupt yours. And, if you sync your Slack status with your schedule, you're doubling the communication power of that calendar context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#stay-flexible"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Stay flexible
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important part of focus time is staying flexible within your schedule. You might have every intention of working on that slide deck you've been putting off, but if an emergency customer meeting comes up that requires your attention, you need to have enough flexibility in your schedule that you can adapt without having to stress. It's far too common for all the hard work you put into your scheduling to go down the drain when a new urgent priority drops and it's all hands on deck. Now you're faced with completely rearranging your schedule once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only is staying flexible important for you, but it is also important for your team! Priorities change, new opportunities arise, and you need to be able to adapt and accommodate. Rigid schedules and time blocks make this very difficult, and can make you inaccessible and unavailable for collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where you might benefit with a smart time blocking tool like Reclaim. You're able to block time for your tasks and regular routines throughout your week, but these time blocks stay flexible to accommodate new meeting requests and priorities. As your schedule fills up, Reclaim will shift your time blocks from "free" time, or bookable time, to "busy" to maximize your availability while defending your focus time. Having a balance of availability and focus is key to actually executing on focus time as a methodology!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#estimate-your-needs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Estimate your needs
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to really maximize the productivity of your focus time, it's important to estimate your needs! If you have an entire afternoon blocked for focus time, how much can actually get through on your to-do list? By incorporating time estimates, due dates and priority levels into your focus time planning, you can clearly see what you have time to get done in a week so you can better forecast your time and prioritize your workload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Reclaim's Planner, you can see what your week really looks like. You not only get a full picture of all your meetings, tasks and regular routines, but you have a priority list on the side to visualize what's most urgent, scheduled, completed, and most importantly, unscheduled. Time does not lie, and if you don't have time to get through everything, you're going to have to kick some stuff out to next week. Reclaim forces you to think about budgeting your time, without actually forcing you to "overthink" it. Just declare what you need, how long you think it will take, and Reclaim tells you what the reality is through your calendar. So whether you need to trim back on meetings this week, or push out some lower priority projects, it's imperative you understand how much focus time you actually have time for, and what you can feasibly do with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#focus-time-examples"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Focus Time examples
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how much focus time do you need? This entirely depends on your role and responsibilities! If you're a manager, you probably need to spend a majority of your week collaborating and leading your team, but if you're an engineer, you likely need to allocate most of your workweek towards your heads-down work. Every person has a different schedule and work demands, so your focus time will be completely unique to your role and personal style of work. Here are a couple focus time examples to help you get started:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engineer needs to preserve at least 30 hours of focus time/week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salesperson wants 1 hour/day and 3 hours on Friday for follow-ups and CRM notes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product manager needs 2 hours, 2 times/week for priority planning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;VP needs 2 hours every Tuesday to review status reports&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Content writer needs 10 hours/week to develop a new blog post &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-add-focus-time-to-your-calendar"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to add focus time to your calendar
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's walk through adding focus time to your calendar using Good, Better and Best approaches so you can make time for your important work sessions every week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-focus-time-blocks-without-a-plan-good"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Create "Focus Time" blocks without a plan - Good 🙂
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a new &lt;a href="https://app.reclaim.ai/habits"&gt;Habit&lt;/a&gt; in Reclaim for "Focus Time"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customize the time window, duration, and frequency of your focus time Habit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Save and auto-schedule your focus time every week! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a good way to make sure you have time for productive work every week, and leverage smart time blocking to maximize your calendar availability, but it lacks intentionality and context as your focus time blocks are unplanned and without purpose. Make sure to have a plan in place before your focus time sessions so you don't waste it wondering how to spend your time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-focus-time-blocks-on-a-set-schedule-better"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Create "Focus Time" blocks on a set schedule - Better 😎
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a "Focus Time" event in Google Calendar (one-time or recurring)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Change the event availability from "Free" to "Busy"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add &lt;a href="https://help.reclaim.ai/en/articles/5464974-use-reclaim_free-to-create-no-meeting-days-or-times"&gt;#reclaim_free&lt;/a&gt; to the event description&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Save &amp;amp; defend your focus time!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While creating a focus time block on a set schedule guarantees you time for solo work, the problem is that it locks you in, leaving you inaccessible for new meetings and collaboration opportunities. Rigid, fixed time blocks on Google Calendar aren't able to adjust to maximize the availability of your schedule like the smart time blocking options in the Good and Best options, which are increasingly important as many companies shift to a global workforce collaborating across time zones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the advantage here is that Reclaim &lt;a href="https://app.reclaim.ai/tasks"&gt;Tasks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://app.reclaim.ai/habits"&gt;Habits&lt;/a&gt; are auto-scheduled within these time blocks when you use #reclaim_free, allowing you to prioritize your most important work in your focus time sessions. This is also a great approach to blocking an entire day for productive work via &lt;a href="https://reclaim.ai/blog/no-meeting-day"&gt;no-meeting days&lt;/a&gt; so you can reduce distractions, increase productivity, and boost morale across your entire team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-focus-time-by-time-blocking-your-habits-and-tasks-best"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Create "Focus Time" by time blocking your Habits and Tasks - Best 🤩
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set up all of your &lt;a href="https://app.reclaim.ai/habits"&gt;Habits&lt;/a&gt; in Reclaim&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set up your weekly &lt;a href="https://app.reclaim.ai/tasks"&gt;Task&lt;/a&gt; list in Reclaim (&lt;a href="https://app.reclaim.ai/settings/integrations"&gt;new Tasks integrations&lt;/a&gt; coming soon)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prioritize your Task list via the Planner as things change&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Auto-schedule your focus time by priority every day!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the best way to set up and optimize your focus time because you're keeping your schedule flexible and oriented around your priorities. If you're just getting started, think through your routines. What do you need to do often? What do you end up doing in the late hours or weekends? Then create Habits for the maximum time range you could envision those routines taking so you can start reigning them back into your core working hours. Next, take your top 3-5 Tasks, especially those that you know are going to take more than an hour or two to complete, and add them to Reclaim. As your week progresses, you can reprioritize and push stuff off as needed using the Planner, and at the end of the week, you'll get to see just how much more you accomplished through your &lt;a href="https://app.reclaim.ai/stats"&gt;calendar productivity stats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://help.reclaim.ai/en/articles/5389397-weekly-reports-overview"&gt;weekly report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may seem like a little more effort on your part, but you're basically just integrating your existing to-dos with your calendar so your workday is aligned around what you actially have to get done. You will get that time back tenfold by putting the effort into strategically planning which tasks are the highest priority, and how long you need to get them done. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focus time is an amazing method for productivity. It not only allows you to get more done in far less time, it also helps you eliminate overtime from your schedule to help you improve your work-life balance. While there are many ways to approach your focus time, the most important thing is just getting it on the calendar so you can start dedicating a healthy portion of your workweek towards productive progress on your priorities. Just remember, the more you put into efficiently using your focus time, the more you will get back! If you have any focus time tips you want to share with us, tweet us @reclaimai.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#web-scraping"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Web scraping:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web Scraping is a way to collect all sorts of publicly available data like prices, text, images, contact information and much more from the world-wide-web. This can be useful when trying to collect data that might take a person a lot of time to collect and organize manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some of the most useful use cases of web scraping include:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scraping product prices from e-commerce websites such as amazon, ebay or alibaba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scraping social media posts, likes, comments, followers or bios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scraping contacts from websites like yellowpages or Linkedin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#puppeteer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Puppeteer
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are a few different libraries for scraping the web with Node.js, in this tutorial, i'll be using the puppeteer library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Puppeteer is a popular and easy to use npm package used for web automation and web scraping purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some of puppeteer's most useful features include:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being able to extract a scraped element's text content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being able to interact with a webpage by filling out forms, clicking on buttons or running searches inside a search bar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being able to scrape and download images from the web.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being able to see the web scraping in progress using headless mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read more about puppeteer &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installation
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this tutorial, I will suppose you already have &lt;strong&gt;npm&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;node_modules&lt;/strong&gt; installed, as well as a &lt;strong&gt;package.json&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;package-lock.json&lt;/strong&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't, here's a great guide on how to do so: &lt;a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-node-js-modules-with-npm-and-package-json"&gt;Setup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To install puppeteer, run one of the following commands in your project's terminal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm i puppeteer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn add puppeteer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once puppeteer is installed, it will appear as a directory inside your node_modules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lets-make-a-simple-web-scraping-script-in-nodejs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Let's make a simple web scraping script in Node.js
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web scraping script will get the first synonym of "smart" from the web thesaurus by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting the HTML contents of the web thesaurus' webpage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding the element that we want to scrape through it's selector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Displaying the text contents of the scraped element.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uYsNi1UQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g1yuk24tdujckpswg8en.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uYsNi1UQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g1yuk24tdujckpswg8en.gif" alt="Scraping"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lets-get-started"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Let's get started!
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before scraping, and then extracting this element's text through it's selector in Node.js, we need to setup a few things first:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create or open an empty javascript file, you can name it whatever you want, but I'll name mine "&lt;strong&gt;index.js&lt;/strong&gt;" for this tutorial. Then, require puppeteer on the first line and create the async function inside which we will be writing our web scraping code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;index.js&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const puppeteer = require('puppeteer')

async function scrape() {
}
scrape()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, initiate a new browser instance and define the "page" variable, which is going to be used for navigating to webpages and scraping elements within a webpage's HTML contents:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;index.js&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const puppeteer = require('puppeteer')

async function scrape() {
   const browser = await puppeteer.launch({})
   const page = await browser.newPage()
}
scrape()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scraping the first synonym of "smart"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To locate and copy the selector of the first synonym of "smart", which is what we're going to use to locate the synonym inside of the web thesaurus' webpage, first go to the &lt;a href="https://www.thesaurus.com/browse/smart"&gt;web thesaurus' synonyms of "smart"&lt;/a&gt;, right click on the first synonym and click on "inspect". This will make this webpage's DOM pop-up at the right of your screen:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LUgj4uNu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b0g5w8duzsrv9clx2fff.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LUgj4uNu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b0g5w8duzsrv9clx2fff.png" alt="Inspect"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, right click on the highlighted HTML element containing the first synonym and click on "copy selector":&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WpX-teFU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3tzgpz7rqxfirnfrjz9a.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WpX-teFU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3tzgpz7rqxfirnfrjz9a.png" alt="Copy selector"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, to navigate to the web thesaurus, scrape and display the first synonym of "smart" through the selector we copied earlier:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, make the "page" variable navigate to &lt;a href="https://www.thesaurus.com/browse/smart"&gt;https://www.thesaurus.com/browse/smart&lt;/a&gt; inside the newly created browser instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, we define the "element" variable by making the page wait for our desired element's selector to appear in the webpage's DOM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The text content of the element is then extracted using the evaluate() function, and displayed inside the "text" variable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we close the browser instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;index.js&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const puppeteer = require('puppeteer')

async function scrape() {
   const browser = await puppeteer.launch({})
   const page = await browser.newPage()

   await page.goto('https://www.thesaurus.com/browse/smart')
   var element = await page.waitFor("#meanings &amp;gt; div.css-ixatld.e15rdun50 &amp;gt; ul &amp;gt; li:nth-child(1) &amp;gt; a")
   var text = await page.evaluate(element =&amp;gt; element.textContent, element)
   console.log(text)
   browser.close()
}
scrape()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#time-to-test"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Time to test
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if you run your index.js script using "node index.js", you will see that it has displayed the first synonym of the word "smart":&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VAWi5h1W--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/t65do4rq7bu4w962bvtw.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VAWi5h1W--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/t65do4rq7bu4w962bvtw.gif" alt="Test"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scraping the top 5 synonyms of smart&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can implement the same code to scrape the top 5 synonyms of smart instead of 1:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;index.js&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const puppeteer = require('puppeteer')

async function scrape() {
   const browser = await puppeteer.launch({})
   const page = await browser.newPage()

   await page.goto('https://www.thesaurus.com/browse/smart')
   for(i = 1; i &amp;lt; 6; i++){
    var element = await page.waitFor("#meanings &amp;gt; div.css-ixatld.e15rdun50 &amp;gt; ul &amp;gt; li:nth-child(" + i + ") &amp;gt; a")
    var text = await page.evaluate(element =&amp;gt; element.textContent, element)
    console.log(text)
   }
   browser.close()
}
scrape()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vzWmk0VK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/44rfjhp90eu7k9163j0p.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vzWmk0VK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/44rfjhp90eu7k9163j0p.gif" alt="5 synonyms"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "&lt;strong&gt;element&lt;/strong&gt;" variable will be: "&lt;strong&gt;#meanings &amp;gt; div.css-ixatld.e15rdun50 &amp;gt; ul &amp;gt; li:nth-child(1) &amp;gt; a&lt;/strong&gt;" on the first iteration, "&lt;strong&gt;#meanings &amp;gt; div.css-ixatld.e15rdun50 &amp;gt; ul &amp;gt; li:nth-child(2) &amp;gt; a&lt;/strong&gt;" on the second, and so on until it reaches the last iteration where the "element" variable will be "&lt;strong&gt;#meanings &amp;gt; div.css-ixatld.e15rdun50 &amp;gt; ul &amp;gt; li:nth-child(5) &amp;gt; a&lt;/strong&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the only thing that is altered in the "element" variable throughout the iterations is the "li:nth-child()" value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because in our case, the elements that we are trying to scrape are all "li" elements inside a "ul" element,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so we can easily scrape them in order by increasing the value inside "li:nth-child()":&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;li:nth-child(1) for the first synonym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;li:nth-child(2) for the second synonym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;li:nth-child(3) for the third synonym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;li:nth-child(4) for the fourth synonym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;And li:nth-child(5) for the fifth synonym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final notes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While web scraping has many advantages like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saving time on manually collecting data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being able to programmatically aggregate pieces of data scraped from the web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating a dataset of data that might be useful for machine learning, data visualization or data analytics purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also has 2 disadvantages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some websites don't allow for scraping their data, one popular example is craigslist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people consider it to be a gray area since some use cases of web scraping practice user or entity data collection and storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#wrapping-up"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Wrapping up
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this article gave you some insight into web scraping in Node.js, it's practical applications, pros and cons, and how to extract specific elements and their text contents from webpages using the puppeteer library.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SML - The language I love to hate. (Recursion example).</title>
      <author>Eckhardt</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 16:46:33 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/eckhardtd/sml-the-language-i-love-to-hate-recursion-example-mem</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/eckhardtd/sml-the-language-i-love-to-hate-recursion-example-mem</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Standard ML has been around for a while, I never cared for it until enrolling at &lt;a href="https://github.com/ossu/computer-science"&gt;OSSU's program&lt;/a&gt;. It's a functional programming language with very interesting features like &lt;code&gt;immutability&lt;/code&gt; and relies heavily on the usage of recursion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-recursive-example-in-sml"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A recursive example in SML
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;fun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;factorial&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="kr"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;factorial&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This function can also be expressed as:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;fun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;factorial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="kr"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kr"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kr"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;factorial&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you use &lt;code&gt;factorial&lt;/code&gt; it may look something like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;val&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;factorial&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c"&gt;(*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cm"&gt; equivalent: 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 *)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And in actual fact, this function actually (cheekily) multiplies by 1 again on the last iteration, which has no effect on the output: &lt;code&gt;120&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#writing-sml-as-a-web-developer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Writing SML as a web developer
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the course assignments it was a REAL pain to not have the ability to declare variables in the upper scope and change their value, or use loops, and dealing with the thinking work that goes into recursion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hot tip: If a function accepts an Array / List that needs to be processed in a loop - it most probably can be done with recursion too. 🤘&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-js-example-rewritten-in-sml"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A JS example re-written in SML
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Return the sum of all elements in an array&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Example 1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sumArray&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nums&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;total&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nums&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nx"&gt;total&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nums&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;total&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sumArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 15&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Example 2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sumArray&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nums&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nums&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;prev&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;curr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;prev&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;curr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sumArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 15&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Much of the logic above is either ludicrous or doesn't exist in SML, and we'll have to do something like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;fun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;sum_array&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;nums&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kr"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;nums&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kr"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kr"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;hd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;nums&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sum_array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;nums&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kr"&gt;val&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;summed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sum_array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c"&gt;(*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cm"&gt; 15 *)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These were just a few quick examples. If you want to see me explain these things (a little) more and If you want to see me do this with 5 slightly more complex problems, give my latest Youtube video a watch:&lt;/p&gt;

  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we developers should definitely focus on the language that is most demanded from us - to improve our skills / knowledge, nevertheless - SML has taught me that there are different and sometimes better and &lt;em&gt;cleaner&lt;/em&gt; ways of solving programming issues.&lt;/p&gt;

Author: Eugene Leonovich&lt;br&gt;
MessagePack is a binary format for data serialization. It is positioned by the authors as a more efficient alternative to JSON. Due to its speed and portability, it's often used as a format for data exchange in high-performance systems. The other reason this format became popular is that it's very easy to implement. Your favorite programming language probably already has several libraries designed to work with it.&lt;br&gt;
In this article, I'm not going to talk about the design of MessagePack, and I am not going to compare it to similar products. There is a lot of information about it on the internet. However, there is not enough information about MessagePack's extension types system. So I'm going to explain what it is, show some examples, and talk about how to make serialization even more effective with extension types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-extension-type"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Extension type
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MessagePack specification defines 9 base types:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Nil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Boolean&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Integer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Float&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  String&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Binary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Array&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Map&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Extension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extension is a container designed for storing extension types. Let's look closely at how it works. It will help us with writing our own types.&lt;br&gt;
Here is how the container is structured:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ASSn3CrM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gqtizld8htnwswrd75to.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ASSn3CrM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gqtizld8htnwswrd75to.png" alt="425470e1345d1767f7f1ae6d29195f30 (1)"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Header&lt;/em&gt; is the container's header (1 to 5 bytes). It contains the payload size, i.e., the length of the Data field. To learn more about how the header is formed, take a look at the &lt;a href="https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack/blob/master/spec.md#ext-format-family"&gt;specification&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Type&lt;/em&gt; is the ID of the stored type, an 8-bit signed integer. Negative values are reserved for official types. User types' IDs can take any value in the range from 0 to 127.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Data&lt;/em&gt; is an arbitrary byte string up to 4 GiB long, which contains the actual data. The format of official types is described in the specification, while the format of user types may depend entirely on the developer's imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of official types currently includes only Timestamp with the ID of -1. Occasionally, we see suggestions to add new types (such as UUID, multidimensional arrays, or geo coordinates), but since the discussions are not very active, I wouldn't expect any updates in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#hello-world"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Hello, World!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--N02wpA0t--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ssplc0x8mo1l6e3ecoqu.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--N02wpA0t--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ssplc0x8mo1l6e3ecoqu.jpg" alt="34ae802c3fd31328904479bee387fe93 (2)"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's enough theory, let's start coding! For these examples, we'll use the &lt;a href="https://github.com/rybakit/msgpack.php"&gt;msgpack.php&lt;/a&gt; MessagePack library since it provides a convenient API to handle extension types. I hope you'll find these code examples easy to understand even if you use other libraries.&lt;br&gt;
Since I mentioned UUID, let's implement support for this data type as an example. To do so, we'll need to write an extension---a class to serialize and deserialize UUID values. We will use the &lt;a href="https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/uid.html"&gt;symfony/uid&lt;/a&gt; library to make handling such values easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This example can be adapted for any UUID library, be it the popular * &lt;a href="https://uuid.ramsey.dev/en/latest/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ramsey/uuid&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, PECL * &lt;a href="https://pecl.php.net/package/uuid"&gt;&lt;em&gt;uuid&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; module, or a user implementation.*&lt;br&gt;
Let's name our class &lt;code&gt;UuidExtension&lt;/code&gt;. The class must implement the &lt;code&gt;Extension&lt;/code&gt; interface:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;use MessagePack\BufferUnpacker;
use MessagePack\Packer;
use MessagePack\TypeTransformer\Extension;
use Symfony\Component\Uid\Uuid;

final class UuidExtension implements Extension
{
    public function getType(): int
    {
        // TODO
    }

    public function pack(Packer $packer, mixed $value): ?string
    {
        // TODO
    }

    public function unpackExt(BufferUnpacker $unpacker, int $extLength): Uuid
    {
        // TODO
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We determined earlier what the type (ID) of the extension is, so we can easily implement the &lt;code&gt;getType()&lt;/code&gt; method. In the simplest case, this method could return a fixed constant, globally defined for the whole project. However, to make the class more versatile, we'll let it define the type when initializing the extension. Let's add a constructor with one integer argument, &lt;code&gt;$type&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;/** @readonly */
private int $type;

public function __construct(int $type)
{
    if ($type &amp;lt; 0 || $type &amp;gt; 127) {
        throw new \OutOfRangeException(
            "Extension type is expected to be between 0 and 127, $type given"
        );
    }

    $this-&amp;gt;type = $type;
}

public function getType(): int
{
    return $this-&amp;gt;type;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let's implement the &lt;code&gt;pack()&lt;/code&gt; method. From the method's signature, we can see that it takes two parameters: a &lt;code&gt;Packer&lt;/code&gt; class instance and a &lt;code&gt;$value&lt;/code&gt; of any type. The method must return either a serialized value (wrapped into the Extension container) or &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; if the class of the extension does not support the value type:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;public function pack(Packer $packer, mixed $value): ?string
{
    if (!$value instanceof Uuid) {
        return null;
    }

    return $packer-&amp;gt;packExt($this-&amp;gt;type, $value-&amp;gt;toBinary());
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reverse operation isn't much harder to implement. The &lt;code&gt;unpackExt()&lt;/code&gt; method takes a &lt;code&gt;BufferUnpacker&lt;/code&gt; instance and the length of the serialized data (the size of the Data field from the schema above). Since we've saved the binary representation of a UUID object in this field, all we need to do is read this data and build a &lt;code&gt;Uuid&lt;/code&gt; object:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;public function unpackExt(BufferUnpacker $unpacker, int $extLength): Uuid
{
    return Uuid::fromString($unpacker-&amp;gt;read($extLength));
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our extension is ready! The last step is to register a class object with a specific ID. Let the ID be &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$uuidExt = new UuidExtension(0);
$packer = $packer-&amp;gt;extendWith($uuidExt);
$unpacker = $unpacker-&amp;gt;extendWith($uuidExt);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's make sure everything works correctly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$uuid = new Uuid('7e3b84a4-0819-473a-9625-5d57ad1c9604');

$packed = $packer-&amp;gt;pack($uuid);
$unpacked = $unpacker-&amp;gt;reset($packed)-&amp;gt;unpack();

assert($uuid-&amp;gt;equals($unpacked));
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was an example of a simple UUID extension. Similarly, you can add support for any other type used in your application: &lt;a href="https://github.com/rybakit/msgpack.php/blob/master/examples/MessagePack/DateTimeExtension.php"&gt;DateTime&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/tarantool-php/client/blob/master/src/Packer/Extension/DecimalExtension.php"&gt;Decimal&lt;/a&gt;, Money. Or you can write a versatile extension that allows serializing any object (as it was done in &lt;a href="https://vkcom.github.io/kphp/kphp-language/howto-by-kphp/serialization-msgpack.html?highlight=msgpack#internal-implementation-details"&gt;KPHP&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;
However, this is not the only use for extensions. I'll now show you some interesting examples that demonstrate other advantages of using extension types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lorem-ipsum-or-compressing-the-incompressible"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  "Lorem ipsum," or compressing the incompressible
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--o6tsW-sJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zyqp8ph4if39wthe6apk.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--o6tsW-sJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zyqp8ph4if39wthe6apk.jpg" alt="851828579dec0b5e1c75b41834b61030 (2)"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you've ever inquired about MessagePack before, you probably know the phrase from its official website, &lt;a href="https://msgpack.org/"&gt;msgpack.org&lt;/a&gt;: "&lt;em&gt;It's like JSON, but fast and small&lt;/em&gt;."&lt;br&gt;
In fact, if you compare how much memory space the same data occupies in JSON and MessagePack, you'll see why the latter is a much more compact format. For example, the number 100 takes 3 bytes in JSON and only 1 in MessagePack. The difference becomes more significant as the number's order of magnitude grows. For the maximum value of int64 (9223372036854775807), the size of the stored data differs by as much as 10 bytes (19 against 9)!&lt;br&gt;
The same is true for boolean values---4 or 5 bytes in JSON against 1 byte in MessagePack. It is also true for arrays because many syntactic symbols---such as commas separating the elements, semicolons separating the key-value pairs, and brackets marking the array limits---don't exist in binary format. Obviously, the larger the array is, the more syntactic litter accumulates along with the payload.&lt;br&gt;
String values, however, are a little more complicated. If your strings don't consist entirely of quotation marks, line feeds, and other special symbols that require escaping, then you won't see a difference between their sizes in JSON and in MessagePack. For example, &lt;code&gt;"foobar"&lt;/code&gt; has a length of 8 bytes in JSON and 7 in MessagePack. Note that the above only applies to UTF-8 strings. For binary strings, JSON's disadvantage against MessagePack is obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knowing this peculiarity of MessagePack, you can have a good laugh reading articles that compare the two formats in terms of data compression efficiency while using mainly string data for the tests. Apparently, any conclusions based on the results of such tests would make no practical sense. So take those articles skeptically and run comparative tests on *&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;your own&lt;/strong&gt;* &lt;em&gt;data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point, there were discussions about whether to add string compression (individual or in frames) to the specification to make string serialization more compact. However, the idea was rejected, and the implementation of this feature was left to users. So let's try it.&lt;br&gt;
Let's create an extension that will compress long strings. We will use whatever compression tool is at hand, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.zlib.php"&gt;zlib&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choose the data compression algorithm based on the specifics of your data. For example, if you are working with lots of short strings, take a look at &lt;em&gt;[*SMAZ&lt;/em&gt;](&lt;a href="https://github.com/antirez/smaz"&gt;https://github.com/antirez/smaz&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the constructor for our new class, &lt;code&gt;TextExtension&lt;/code&gt;. The first argument is the extension ID, and as a second optional argument, we'll add minimum string length. Strings shorter than this value will be serialized in a standard way, without compression. In this way, we will avoid cases where the compressed string ends up longer than the initial one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;final class TextExtension implements Extension
{
    /** @readonly */
    private int $type;

    /** @var positive-int */
    private int $minLength;

    public function __construct(int $type, int $minLength = 100)
    {
        ...

        $this-&amp;gt;type = $type;
        $this-&amp;gt;minLength = $minLength;
    }

    ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To implement the &lt;code&gt;pack()&lt;/code&gt; method, we might write something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;public function pack(Packer $packer, mixed $value): ?string
{
    if (!is_string($value)) {
        return null;
    }

    if (strlen($value) &amp;lt; $this-&amp;gt;minLength) {
        return $packer-&amp;gt;packStr($value);
    }

    // compress and pack
    ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this wouldn't work. String is one of the basic types, so the packer will serialize it before our extension is called. The reason is that serialization is implemented in msgpack.php for better performance. Otherwise, before serializing each value, the packer would need to scan the available extensions, considerably slowing down the process.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore, we need to tell the packer not to serialize certain strings as, you know, strings but to use an extension. As you might guess from the &lt;a href="#uuid-example"&gt;UUID example&lt;/a&gt;, it can be done via a &lt;a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ValueObject.html"&gt;ValueObject&lt;/a&gt;. Let's call it &lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt;, similar to the extension class:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;/**
 * @psalm-immutable
 */
final class Text
{
    public function __construct(
        public string $str
    ) {}


    public function __toString(): string
    {
        return $this-&amp;gt;str;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So instead of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$packed = $packer-&amp;gt;pack("a very long string");
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we'll use a &lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt; object to mark long strings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$packed = $packer-&amp;gt;pack(new Text("a very long string"));
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's update the &lt;code&gt;pack()&lt;/code&gt; method:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;public function pack(Packer $packer, mixed $value): ?string
{
    if (!$value instanceof Text) {
        return null;
    }

    $length = strlen($value-&amp;gt;str);
    if ($length &amp;lt; $this-&amp;gt;minLength) {
        return $packer-&amp;gt;packStr($value-&amp;gt;str);
    }

    // compress and pack
    ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we just need to compress the string and put the result in an Extension. Note that the minimum length limit does not guarantee that the string will take less space after compression. For this reason, you might want to compare the lengths of the compressed string and the original and choose whichever is more compact:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$context = deflate_init(ZLIB_ENCODING_GZIP);
$compressed = deflate_add($context, $value-&amp;gt;str, ZLIB_FINISH);

return isset($compressed[$length - 1])
    ? $packer-&amp;gt;packStr($value-&amp;gt;str)
    : $packer-&amp;gt;packExt($this-&amp;gt;type, $compressed);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deserialization:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;public function unpackExt(BufferUnpacker $unpacker, int $extLength): string
{
    $compressed = $unpacker-&amp;gt;read($extLength);
    $context = inflate_init(ZLIB_ENCODING_GZIP);

    return inflate_add($context, $compressed, ZLIB_FINISH);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's see the result:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$longString = &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;STR
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod 
tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, 
quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo

STR;

$packedString = $packer-&amp;gt;pack($longString); // 448 bytes
$packedCompressedString = $packer-&amp;gt;pack(new Text($longString)); // 291 bytes
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, we saved 157 bytes, or &lt;em&gt;35% of what would be the standard serialization result&lt;/em&gt;, on a single line!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#from-schemaless-to-schemamixed"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  From "schema-less" to "schema-mixed"
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--p8BaWaOA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hom3tiyn4bw7uqyfwo1g.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--p8BaWaOA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hom3tiyn4bw7uqyfwo1g.jpg" alt="04bbfc5f6758a3841bc7753e4421e960 (8)"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compressing long strings is not the only way to save space. MessagePack is a &lt;em&gt;schemaless&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;schema-on-read&lt;/em&gt;, format that has its advantages and disadvantages. One of the disadvantages in comparison with &lt;em&gt;schema-full&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;schema-on-write&lt;/em&gt;) formats is highly ineffective serialization of repeated data structures. For example, this happens with selections from a database where all elements in the resulting array have a similar structure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$userProfiles = [
    [
        'id' =&amp;gt; 1,
        'first_name' =&amp;gt; 'First name 1',
        'last_name' =&amp;gt; 'Last name 1',
    ],
    [
        'id' =&amp;gt; 2,
        'first_name' =&amp;gt; 'First name 2',
        'last_name' =&amp;gt; 'Last name 2',
    ],
    ...
    [
        'id' =&amp;gt; 100,
        'first_name' =&amp;gt; 'First name 100',
        'last_name' =&amp;gt; 'Last name 100',
    ],
];
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you serialize this array with MessagePack, the repeated keys of each element in the array will take a substantial part of the total data size. But what if we could save the keys of such structured arrays just once? It would significantly cut down the size and also speed up serialization since the packer would have fewer operations to perform.&lt;br&gt;
Like before, we are going to use extension types for that. Our type will be a value object wrapped around an arbitrary &lt;em&gt;structured&lt;/em&gt; array:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;/**
 * @psalm-immutable
 */
final class StructList
{
    public function __construct(
        public array $list,
    ) {}
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If your project includes a library for database handling, there is probably a special class in that library to store table selection results. You can use this class as a type instead of/along with&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;StructList&lt;/code&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is how we are going to serialize such arrays. First, we'll check the array size. Of course, if the array is empty or has only one element, there is no reason to store keys separately from values. We'll serialize arrays like these in a standard way.&lt;br&gt;
In other cases, we'll first save a list of keys and then a list of values. We won't be storing an associative array list, which is the standard MessagePack option. Instead, we'll write data in a more compact form:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yYSeIT90--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1hv5qdcphz9uxjxqbt3y.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yYSeIT90--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1hv5qdcphz9uxjxqbt3y.png" alt="3ca04136382cc4c0767fbc1626e9908d (9)"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;final class StructListExtension implements Extension
{
    ...

    public function pack(Packer $packer, mixed $value): ?string
    {
        if (!$value instanceof StructList) {
            return null;
        }

        $size = count($value-&amp;gt;list);
        if ($size &amp;lt; 2) {
            return $packer-&amp;gt;packArray($value-&amp;gt;list);
        }

        $keys = array_keys(reset($value-&amp;gt;list));

        $values = '';
        foreach ($value-&amp;gt;list as $item) {
            foreach ($keys as $key) {
                $values .= $packer-&amp;gt;pack($item[$key]);
            }
        }

        return $packer-&amp;gt;packExt($this-&amp;gt;type,
            $packer-&amp;gt;packArray($keys).
            $packer-&amp;gt;packArrayHeader($size).
            $values
        );
    }

    ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To deserialize, we need to unpack the keys array and then use it to restore the initial array:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;public function unpackExt(BufferUnpacker $unpacker, int $extLength): array
{
    $keys = $unpacker-&amp;gt;unpackArray();
    $size = $unpacker-&amp;gt;unpackArrayHeader();

    $list = [];
    for ($i = 0; $i &amp;lt; $size; ++$i) {
        foreach ($keys as $key) {
            $list[$i][$key] = $unpacker-&amp;gt;unpack();
        }
    }

    return $list;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it! Now, if we serialize &lt;code&gt;$profiles&lt;/code&gt; from the example above as a normal array and as a structured &lt;code&gt;StructList&lt;/code&gt;, we'll see a great difference in size---&lt;em&gt;the latter will be 47% more compact&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
    $packedList = $packer-&amp;gt;pack($profiles); // 5287 bytes&lt;br&gt;
    $packedStructList = $packer-&amp;gt;pack(new StructList($profiles)); // 2816 bytes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could go further and create a specialized &lt;code&gt;Profiles&lt;/code&gt; type to store information about the array structure in the extension code. This way, we wouldn't need to save the keys array. However, in this case, we would lose in versatility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've taken a look at just a few examples of using extension types in MessagePack. To see more examples, check the &lt;a href="https://github.com/rybakit/msgpack.php/tree/master/examples"&gt;msgpack.php&lt;/a&gt; library. For the implementations of all extension types supported by the &lt;a href="https://www.tarantool.io/en/doc/latest/dev_guide/internals/msgpack_extensions/"&gt;Tarantool&lt;/a&gt; protocol, see the &lt;a href="https://github.com/tarantool-php/client/tree/master/src/Packer/Extension"&gt;tarantool/client&lt;/a&gt; library.&lt;br&gt;
I hope this article gave you a sense of what extension types are and how they can be useful. If you're already using MessagePack but haven't known about the feature, this information may inspire you to revise your current methods and start writing custom types.&lt;br&gt;
If you're just wondering which serialization format to choose for your next project, the article might help you make a reasonable choice, adding a point in favor of MessagePack :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Confused About rem and em units in CSS?</title>
      <author>Mahesh </author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 16:32:35 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/ali6nx404/confused-about-rem-and-em-units-in-css-26go</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;rem and em units in CSS is creating confusion for beginners, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most beginners don't understand the correct meaning of both units and then use them without thinking much and it creates lots of problems for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;em and rem both are known as relative units in CSS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You've probably been using em and rem units now for a while already, but still, you might be confused about which unit is best in which scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-em"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is em?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An em value is equal to the computed font size of the parent of that element. example if font size of parent element is 20 px then 1em is equal to 20px.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if the font size is not specified in the parent element then it will look continues up until the root element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Root element font size is provided by the browser and by default it is 16px.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in this case, 1em is equal to 16px.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#compounding-effect-of-em-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  compounding effect of em -
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;check the below challenge, and then jump on the answer and understand how em works.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We have three divs,  container, parent, and child and respectively are specified font-size 1em, 3em, and 2em.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;font-size of container is 1em eqaul to 16px.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;font size of parent is 3em means 3 * 16px ( parent font-size) so it becomes 48px now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;font size of child is 2em means 2 * 48px ( size of parent element) so it becomes 96px now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the final size of the child becomes 96px, 😅 power of compounding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;check live example 👇&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;let's see this in action 👇&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-rem"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is rem?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While em is relative to the font size of its direct or nearest parent, rem is only relative to the Html (root) font size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;by default, it is 16px until we didn't specify in the Html element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;rem value is not much convenient when it comes to specifying such as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1rem = 16px &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if we want to use 10px than we need to calculate the rem value which is equal to 0.625rem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve this problem we have one trick, specify the Html element font size as 62.5%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;than our 1rem becomes 10px and now we are able to calculate size easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#which-is-better"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Which is better?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no better unit really, and it all depends on your personal choice. Some people like to use rem units for consistency and scalability, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;while some like to use em units in places where the influence of nearby parent elements would make sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally use rem more than em but be careful with both, em becomes a trouble when you don't understand the relation between parents and child, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and we already see the example of compounding effect in em. so I like to say use rem more often than em.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to calculate the accurate size in rem and em, then &lt;a href="http://pxtoem.com/"&gt;pxtoem&lt;/a&gt; website is pretty useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion -
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying both units and understanding the use cases is most important. I would like to suggest you play with both units and understand both of them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="#definition"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Definition
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doubly linked list is a type of &lt;em&gt;linked list&lt;/em&gt; in which each node apart from storing its data has two pointers. The first pointer points to the previous node in the list and the second pointer points to the next node in the list. The head node its previous value points to NULL and similar to the tail node its next value points to null.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7cPkM3SI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xw4avvk6lcw9m7p3ubpy.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7cPkM3SI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xw4avvk6lcw9m7p3ubpy.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and saving a second reference to nodes requires more space in memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;let's recap the main properties of the linked list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main properties of the linked list are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;length: The number of nodes in the linked list &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Head: The first node&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tail: The last node&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See more in my last post &lt;a href="https://dev.to/riviergrullon/javascript-datastructure-linked-list-2ocn"&gt;Javascript Data structure - Linked list&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in this case the nodes will be contain the next properties:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;next: pointer to the next node&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;value: actual value of the node&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prev: pointer to the previous node &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and the main operations here are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;append&lt;/strong&gt;: Add a node to the end in the linked list&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;prepend&lt;/strong&gt;: Add a node to the beggining the linked list&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;removeFirst&lt;/strong&gt;: remove the first node (head) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;removeLast&lt;/strong&gt;: remove the last node(tail)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;search&lt;/strong&gt;: find a node by his value and returned&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;remove&lt;/strong&gt;: remove a node by its value from the linked list&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;tail&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;tail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;prev&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;tail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;tempTail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;search&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentNode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentNode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;tempNode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;search&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;tempNode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;tail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;removeLast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;tempNode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;removeFirst&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;tempNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;prev&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;tempNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;tempNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;prev&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;tempNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;prev&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a class with a constructor that initializes the head, tail and length of the linked list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Define a method &lt;em&gt;search()&lt;/em&gt; that iterate through the list to find a specific node.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Define two convenience methods, &lt;em&gt;append()&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;prepend()&lt;/em&gt; that use to insert a new element at the start or end of the nodes respectively and increase the length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Define a method &lt;em&gt;remove()&lt;/em&gt; that uses the &lt;em&gt;search&lt;/em&gt; to find the node and replacing its value to delete it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define two convenients methods &lt;em&gt;removeFirst()&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;removeLast()&lt;/em&gt; to remove the head or the tail.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;LinkedList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;prepend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;55&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In my last post of linked list I made a mistake writting the linked list, the point of the linked list is to avoid arrays, so in this post I want to make up for my mistake :) this series is for learning and thank u all for the feedbacks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>7 Easy-to-Follow Best Practices for Writing Dockerfile

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dockerfile allows you to create container images in such a way as if you were writing shell scripts. This simplicity is excellent indeed, but &lt;strong&gt;it does NOT mean that you don't need to learn good practices for writing Dockerfile&lt;/strong&gt;. Just a few practices will make your container images more optimized and secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This article shows a list of 7 best practices for writing Dockerfile along with some &lt;a href="https://github.com/flatt-security/shisho"&gt;Shisho&lt;/a&gt; rules to detect the issues&lt;/strong&gt;. You may not know Shisho, but it's okay because Shisho is extremely easy to use; all you need to do for checking your Dockerfile is just by running the following command:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/security-aware-repo-examples/dockerfile-best-practice/master/rules/docker.shisho.yaml &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; docker.shisho.yaml &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    docker run &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-v&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="si"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;pwd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;:/workspace ghcr.io/flatt-security/shisho-cli:latest check ./docker.shisho.yaml &lt;span class="nb"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you're an user of GitHub Actions, you can copy &lt;a href="https://github.com/security-aware-repo-examples/dockerfile-best-practice/blob/master/.github/workflows/security.yaml"&gt;this example workflow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/security-aware-repo-examples/dockerfile-best-practice/blob/master/shisho.yaml"&gt;the rule file&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://github.com/security-aware-repo-examples/dockerfile-best-practice"&gt;security-aware-repo-examples/dockerfile-best-practice&lt;/a&gt; to your repository. The workflow checks your repository with the rule, and it reports them to GitHub Code Scanning. The issues will appear at &lt;code&gt;https://github.com/&amp;lt;your org&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;your repository&amp;gt;/security/code-scanning&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eTxbPE_v--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/v71m9uscc6b492bkfrke.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eTxbPE_v--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/v71m9uscc6b492bkfrke.png" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's get started!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#recycle-three-practices-for-maintainability"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ♻️ Three Practices for Maintainability
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-avoid-to-use-raw-latest-endraw-tag-for-immutability"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Avoid to use &lt;code&gt;latest&lt;/code&gt; tag for immutability
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;latest&lt;/code&gt; tag is used to create a docker image whose base is the latest version of another image. The use of &lt;code&gt;latest&lt;/code&gt; tag, however, might cause confusion and inconsistent behaviour among built images. &lt;strong&gt;It is better to pin the version of your base images if possible&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following Shisho rule will detect the use of &lt;code&gt;latest&lt;/code&gt; tag:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;version: '1'
rules:
  - id: 'use-fixed-tag-sfor-immutablity'
    language: dockerfile
    message: |
      The use of `latest` tag might cause confusion and inconsistent behavior in automated builds. It is better to pin the version of your base images.
    patterns: 
      - pattern: FROM :[IMAGE]
      - pattern: FROM :[IMAGE] as :[ALIAS]
      - pattern: FROM :[IMAGE]:latest
      - pattern: FROM :[IMAGE]:latest as :[ALIAS]
      - pattern: FROM :[IMAGE]@:[HASH]
      - pattern: FROM :[IMAGE]@:[HASH] as :[ALIAS]
      - pattern: FROM :[IMAGE]:latest@:[HASH]
      - pattern: FROM :[IMAGE]:latest@:[HASH] as :[ALIAS]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://play.shisho.dev/p/pCUKzhjNrCdI"&gt;(You can see the working example of this rule at Shisho Playground)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-use-an-idiomatic-way-to-run-raw-aptget-install-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Use an idiomatic way to run &lt;code&gt;apt-get install&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may often run &lt;code&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt; inside your Dockerfile as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight docker"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;RUN &lt;/span&gt;apt-get update
&lt;span class="k"&gt;RUN &lt;/span&gt;apt-get &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-y&lt;/span&gt; nginx &amp;lt;... and some more packages&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;However, the example above has two issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the cache image for the first &lt;code&gt;RUN&lt;/code&gt; is available, the second &lt;code&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt; might install old packages due to not running &lt;code&gt;apt-get update&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some layers for this image have cache files for &lt;code&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt;, resulting in larger image size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple way to address these issues is running &lt;code&gt;apt-get update&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;apt-get install&lt;/code&gt; in a single &lt;code&gt;RUN&lt;/code&gt; instruction.  &lt;strong&gt;The following examples show an idiomatic way to run them once while removing &lt;code&gt;/var/lib/apt/lists/*&lt;/code&gt; (i.e. apt caches) to reduce the image size more&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;RUN apt-get update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \
    apt-get install -y nginx &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The following Shisho rule will enforce the use of this idiom:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;version: '1'
rules:
  - id: 'remove-cache-of-apt-get'
    language: dockerfile
    message: |
      It is better to remove cache files of `apt-get` to keep your image slim.
    pattern: |
      RUN apt-get install :[X]
    rewrite: |
        RUN apt-get update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \
            apt-get install :[X] &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \
            rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://play.shisho.dev/p/MXSj8P0WnLff"&gt;(You can see the working example of this rule at Shisho Playground)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-use-raw-noinstallrecommends-endraw-flag-of-raw-aptget-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Use &lt;code&gt;--no-install-recommends&lt;/code&gt; flag of &lt;code&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is even better to avoid to install any unnecessary tools by &lt;code&gt;--no-install-recommends&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt; command. The following Shisho rule may help the use of this flag:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;version: "1"
rules:
  - id: "use-no-install-recommends-flag-apt-get"
    language: dockerfile
    message: |
      You can avoid to install any unnecessary tools by `--no-install-recommends` on `apt-get`.
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          RUN apt-get install :[...X]
      - pattern: |
          RUN :[...Y] apt-get install :[...X]
    constraints:
      - target: X
        should: not-match
        regex-pattern: ".*--no-install-recommends.*"
    rewrite_options:
      - |

  🛡️ Four Practices for Security
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While container technology brings many advantages, such as portability or isolation, it also creates new threats from a security perspective. This section describes common docker security issues and explains how to avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-avoid-to-store-secrets-in-environment-variables"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Avoid to store secrets in environment variables
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hardcoded secrets in your Dockerfile will be stored in resulting images. &lt;strong&gt;You should avoid to embed the secrets.&lt;/strong&gt; You can inject environment variables at run-time instead.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

  &lt;a href="#5-use-trusted-base-images"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Use trusted base images
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A docker image consists of multiple layers, and some of them are usually derived from the base image. Here exists a risk of supply chain attacks! &lt;strong&gt;It is better to use official images to reduce the risk as much as possible&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;version: '1'

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://play.shisho.dev/p/4kK3OmX8WZ7E"&gt;(You can see the working example of this rule at Shisho Playground)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you already have a list of trusted base images, some slight changes will let you use them:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;version: '1'

    constraints:

        should: not-match-any-of
        regex-patterns:
            - "^[^/]+$"
            - "^image-name/you-trust$"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://play.shisho.dev/p/VkWKIes7zyXa"&gt;(You can see the working example of this rule at Shisho Playground)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-avoid-to-run-raw-curl-ltgt-sh-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. Avoid to run &lt;code&gt;curl &amp;lt;...&amp;gt; | sh&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many shell scripts and dockerfiles use &lt;code&gt;curl &amp;lt;...&amp;gt; | sh&lt;/code&gt; as an idiomatic way to run an external script inside computers/containers, but this idiom has a risk of remote code execution by attackers through MITM attacks or compromising the distributed script itself (see &lt;a href="https://about.codecov.io/security-update/"&gt;the report of recent codecov incident&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;strong&gt;It is better to check the integrity of what you download before running it as a shell script.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;version: "1"
rules:
  - id: "check-integrity-of-downloaded-shell-script"

          - wget[^|^&amp;gt;]*[|&amp;gt;]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://play.shisho.dev/p/pBMNlxgalIOn"&gt;(You can see the working example of this rule at Shisho Playground)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#7-use-raw-copy-endraw-instead-of-raw-add-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  7. Use &lt;code&gt;COPY&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;ADD&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ADD&lt;/code&gt; instruction allows us to fetch resources over the network and extract an archive, but it may cause security issues such as Meet-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks or Zip Slip vulnerabilities. &lt;strong&gt;It is better to use &lt;code&gt;COPY&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;ADD&lt;/code&gt; if possible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following Shisho rule detects the use of &lt;code&gt;ADD&lt;/code&gt; instructions:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;version: '1'
rules:
  - id: 'use-copy-instead-of-add'
    language: dockerfile
    message: |

    pattern: ADD :[FROM] :[TO]
    rewrite: COPY :[FROM] :[TO]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, I presented some best practices for writing Dockerfile and demonstrated how to check your Dockerfile is following the practices continuously by &lt;a href="https://github.com/flatt-security/shisho"&gt;Shisho&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can try Shisho at &lt;a href="https://play.shisho.dev" rel="nofollow"&gt;our playground&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Try with Docker&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can try shisho in your machine as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell position-relative overflow-auto js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;func test(v []string) int { return len(v) + 1; }&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; docker run -i ghcr.io/flatt-security/shisho-cli:latest find &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;len(:[...])&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; --lang=go&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Install with pre-built binaries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you'd like to run shisho outside docker containers, please follow the instructions below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
Linux / macOS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the following command(s):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell position-relative overflow-auto js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Linux&lt;/span&gt;
wget https://github.com/flatt-security/shisho/releases/latest/download/build-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.zip -O shisho.zip
unzip shisho.zip
chmod +x ./shisho
mv ./shisho /usr/local/bin/shisho
&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; macOS&lt;/span&gt;
wget https://github.com/flatt-security/shisho/releases/latest/download/build-x86_64-apple-darwin.zip -O shisho.zip
unzip shisho.zip
chmod +x ./shisho
mv ./shisho /usr/local/bin/shisho&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you'll see a…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="gh-btn-container"&gt;&lt;a class="gh-btn" href="https://github.com/flatt-security/shisho"&gt;View on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/coder4_life/fibonacci-sequence-in-java-2k32</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Fibonacci sequence is one of the most famous formulas in mathematics. Each number in the sequence is the sum of the two numbers that precede it. So, the sequence goes: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Monitoring AWS Lambda </title>
      <author>Daniel Dominguez</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 15:54:49 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/dominguezdaniel/monitoring-aws-lambda-3gfn</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/dominguezdaniel/monitoring-aws-lambda-3gfn</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Monitoring &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/"&gt;AWS Lambda&lt;/a&gt; performance helps you identify any issues, and it can also send you alerts and notify you of anything you might need to know. The world is slowly getting to a point where machines and computers will be flawless, but until then, if we let them perform various tasks for us, we could at least monitor their performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below the top 5 AWS Lambda monitoring tools:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Datadog&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/"&gt;Datadog&lt;/a&gt; provides the unity of metrics, logs, and traces. Aggregating events and metrics from more than 200 technologies such as Amazon Web Services, MongoDB, Slack, Docker, Chef, and many others. Datadog also explores enriched data, searches and analyzes log data while tracing requests across the distributed systems, and alerts you on app performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Dashbird&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dashbird.io/"&gt;Dashbird&lt;/a&gt; is excellent in providing error alerts and also in monitoring support. Dashbird collects and analyzes CloudWatch logs while zeroing the effects on your AWS Lambda performance. Integration with the Slack account is also possible, and that brings alerts about early exits, crashes, cold starts, timeouts, runtime errors, etc., to your development chat. Dashbird’s error diagnostics, advanced log searching, and function statistics are only a few of the benefits Dashbird offers to its users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Logz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://logz.io/"&gt;Logz&lt;/a&gt; offers ELK service the best choice for scaling and performance with ease while there’s no need to perform upgrades or capacity management. Logz.io security is enterprise-grade, and it keeps your data private and secure while also complying with key industry standards. Logz.io goes way beyond the ELK service to provide an Enterprise-Class log analytics platform consisted of features like integrated alerts and multiple sub-accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Thundra&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thundra.io/"&gt;Thundra&lt;/a&gt; started as a serverless monitoring platform but later switched to targeting more general services. While they’re still a good choice for serverless systems, their tools can now be used for containers and virtual machines too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Lumigo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://lumigo.io/"&gt;Lumigo&lt;/a&gt; offers visual debugging, and it also comes with tracing, metrics, and alert support, but, differing from Thundra, it is more focused on serverless monitoring, from the architecture down to function logs and traces. Lumigo also comes with a Lambda Layer/Extension for Python and Node.js runtimes to instrument Lambda functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion learning about how to approach the serverless monitoring architecture will for sure make your life (and work) much easier. With a proper understanding of the AWS infrastructure, you are one step closer to a new skill called “observability” regarding the lambda functions. The price is set, but it’s a small one compared to the lambda function benefits you’ll obtain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And you? What monitoring tool do you use?, Let me know in the comments!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Create a Single Page Application with React and Sanity</title>
      <author>Joel Olawanle</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 15:38:52 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/sanity-io/how-to-create-a-single-page-application-with-react-and-sanity-2ggl</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/sanity-io/how-to-create-a-single-page-application-with-react-and-sanity-2ggl</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever thought of building a single-page application(SPA) with react &amp;amp; Sanity? In this guide, I will take you on an exciting journey to build your first SPA with react and Sanity. We will create a Food Catalog app that will contain various food items and categories to organize them by themselves. All these categories and foods will be fetched from Sanity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the project &lt;a href="https://github.com/olawanlejoel/spa-react-sanity"&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;; you can clone or download the complete project. You can also see the deployed app &lt;a href="https://spa-react-sanity.netlify.app/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: This is a "follow along" kind of article. You'll definitely have a good result if you build along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OyG88nrv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2cmexyw1wzasd2i8yus8.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OyG88nrv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2cmexyw1wzasd2i8yus8.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#requirementsprerequisites"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Requirements/Prerequisites
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand this guide and code along, you should have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least a little experience or knowledge of &lt;a href="https://reactjs.org/"&gt;React&lt;/a&gt; and some of its hooks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://nodejs.org/en/"&gt;Node&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/"&gt;npm&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://yarnpkg.com/"&gt;yarn&lt;/a&gt; installed on your computer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic understanding of how the terminal works&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-react"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is React?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React is an open-source JavaScript library created for building fast and interactive user interfaces for web and mobile applications. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used for the development of single-page or mobile applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React is a component-based framework, which means we'll be writing our code in small, reusable pieces and putting them all together to make our website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#understanding-spa"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Understanding SPA
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SPA stands for &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;ingle &lt;strong&gt;P&lt;/strong&gt;age &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;pplication. It is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current page rather than loading entire new pages from the server. In simpler terms, it is an app that works inside a browser and does not require page reloading during use. We'll also touch on how routing works in React and learn how to map different parts of our website to different views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setting-up-a-react-app"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setting up a React app
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this guide, we will make use of create-react-app — the React recommended way to create a single-page application. To make use of &lt;code&gt;create-react-app&lt;/code&gt;, You'll need to have Node &amp;gt;= 14.0.0 and npm &amp;gt;= 5.6 on your machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To install, run the following command:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;npx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;food&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;catalog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the installation, you can move into the project's root directory to start the development server.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;food&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;catalog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;npm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the dev server is ready, you can view your project in the browser at &lt;a href="http://localhost:3000/"&gt;http://localhost:3000/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EA5NLWuw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/urkztra8bcbx7f2s3wnj.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EA5NLWuw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/urkztra8bcbx7f2s3wnj.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your project directory should look like this once the setup is complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--07kYP4Mq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6ifbcw9at6zr76w1wdsp.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--07kYP4Mq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6ifbcw9at6zr76w1wdsp.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's clean up the app by deleting files we don't need so we can get started building our app. You can delete the following highlighted files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ylvBCCGA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hh7g8fwo5if6cvwpqczl.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ylvBCCGA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hh7g8fwo5if6cvwpqczl.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: This might throw an error, so ensure you delete the &lt;code&gt;logo.svg&lt;/code&gt; import from &lt;code&gt;App.css&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;index.css&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;reportWebVitals.js&lt;/code&gt; import from &lt;code&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure your files look like mine exactly, I pushed my setup files to &lt;a href="https://github.com/olawanlejoel/create-react-app"&gt;this GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;, and you can clone it or cross-check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#using-tailwind-css"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Using Tailwind CSS
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework used to build frontend applications. Rather than adding obscure CSS classes to your code, with TailwindCSS, you use utility classes to create your components, with as much control over every single styling as you want. All without having to ever write a single line of CSS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many ways to make use of Tailwind CSS in &lt;a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app"&gt;React&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation"&gt;frameworks generally&lt;/a&gt;, but for this guide, we will be making use of the &lt;a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#using-tailwind-via-cdn"&gt;CDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;code&gt;/src&lt;/code&gt; folder, add the following CDN import to the &lt;code&gt;App.css&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;https://unpkg.com/tailwindcss@^2/dist/tailwind.min.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once this is done, we can now proceed to set up our sanity studio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-sanity"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Sanity?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanity is a content platform that treats your structured content as data. It comes bundled with an open-source, real-time headless CMS that can be customized with JavaScript. We'll be using the Sanity studio to manage our content and accessing it in our frontend through Sanity's "out of the box" API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key benefits of Sanity is that the content management interface, or "studio," is open source and built to be built upon. If you know React, you can extend and customize it to your heart's content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#getting-started-with-sanitysetup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Getting started with Sanity/setup
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start a new project with Sanity, we'll install the &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sanity/cli"&gt;Sanity CLI&lt;/a&gt; globally. To do this, you will need to have Node and npm installed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;npm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;g&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;sanity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/cl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;i
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As soon as the CLI finishes installing, you'll be able to create a new project using it. Run the following in the directory of the React project you just created (i.e., food-catalog-app).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sanity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If this is your first time, this will log you into Sanity, and then you will be able to create a project, set up a dataset, and generate files that are necessary to run the editing environment locally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: If you don't have an account, Sanity will direct you on how to get one. Or, you could visit Sanity's website and create an account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once that is done, you will be prompted to create a new project, tap &lt;strong&gt;Enter&lt;/strong&gt;. Name your project &lt;strong&gt;food-catalog-studio&lt;/strong&gt; and choose the default dataset configuration by typing &lt;code&gt;Y&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jbF6yQYo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jvw66jgpv2ca5lssz941.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jbF6yQYo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jvw66jgpv2ca5lssz941.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, confirm the project path and choose a schema for your studio. For this demo, you'll need to start with the "&lt;strong&gt;Clean project with no predefined schemas&lt;/strong&gt;" option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6TJxfgFU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5z4hmfj2f3lf7geel5s8.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6TJxfgFU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5z4hmfj2f3lf7geel5s8.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start the studio, move to the folder by running the following command in the terminal:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;studio&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, you can start the studio with the following command:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sanity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After compiling, the studio will open on &lt;a href="http://localhost:3333/"&gt;http://localhost:3333&lt;/a&gt;, and we will have something like this displayed because we choose "clean project with no predefined schemas" when setting up our studio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lhWcCzj---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rlu4v7lbmkx3dozptrx4.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lhWcCzj---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rlu4v7lbmkx3dozptrx4.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sanity-studio"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Sanity studio
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.sanity.io/studio"&gt;Sanity Studio&lt;/a&gt; is an open-source CMS built with React.js that allows users to use toolkits and plugins to create the workflow that optimizes for how you want to work with content. It offers rapid configuration and free form customization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-a-food-catalog-schema-from-scratch"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating a food catalog schema from scratch
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A schema describes the different field types in a document. There are different &lt;a href="https://www.sanity.io/docs/schema-types"&gt;types of schema&lt;/a&gt; you can choose from. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this guide, we will be creating two schemas: one for the food categories and the other for food items. The food schema will have properties such as food name, food description, food image, and its category, while the category schema will have the name, image, description, and then a hex-code field for creating dynamic styling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the studio starts up, it looks for the &lt;code&gt;schema.js&lt;/code&gt; file in the &lt;code&gt;schemas&lt;/code&gt; folder of your project. For now, since we don't have any schema, you will find something like this in your &lt;code&gt;schema.js&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// First, we must import the schema creator&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createSchema&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;part:@sanity/base/schema-creator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Then import schema types from any plugins that might expose them&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;schemaTypes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;all:part:@sanity/base/schema-type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Then we give our schema to the builder and provide the result to Sanity&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createSchema&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// We name our schema&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Then proceed to concatenate our document type&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// to the ones provided by any plugins that are installed&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;types&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;schemaTypes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* Your types here! */&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;]),&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All your schemas go into the &lt;code&gt;types&lt;/code&gt; array by defining the schemas title, name, type, and finally, the fields. For our &lt;code&gt;foods&lt;/code&gt; schema, we will be having something like this.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;types&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;schemaTypes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* Your types here! */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Foods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;foods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;fields&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Food Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;foodName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;validation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Rule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Rule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;required&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;A little description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;foodDesc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;maxLength&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;validation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Rule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Rule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;required&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Food Image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;foodImage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;hotspot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Category schema goes here&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;]),&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once you have done this, save and now let's take a deeper look at the code above, each object represents a field and must have a title, name, and type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Title&lt;/strong&gt;: The display name for this field&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Name&lt;/strong&gt;: The identifier for this field used in the API's&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Type&lt;/strong&gt;: The type of this field, e.g., string, image, e.t.c. You can find the complete list of built-in types &lt;a href="https://www.sanity.io/docs/schema-types"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second schema to create is the &lt;code&gt;category&lt;/code&gt; schema which we'll add just below the foods schema object.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;category&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Category&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;fields&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Slug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;slug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;slug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;maxLength&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;96&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;hotspot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Hex Code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;hexCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Save the file, and you will see something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nQay3EJz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tua783jvona2ci81208f.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nQay3EJz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tua783jvona2ci81208f.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last thing to do will be to include a category in our &lt;code&gt;foods&lt;/code&gt; schema. It displays the category fetched from the category schema for you when filling in your foods. To do that, we will create a new field wherever in the array we want this field to be&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;category&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Category&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;reference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;category&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once you save your code and create a new document of type &lt;code&gt;food&lt;/code&gt; in your studio, you should see the &lt;code&gt;categories&lt;/code&gt; field show up as expected. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#organizing-our-schema"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Organizing our schema
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's organize our schemas before loading them with foods and categories. Having all our schemas in just one file will always work but can become very difficult to maintain when you have more schemas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is recommended to describe each document type in a separate file and import them into &lt;code&gt;schema.js&lt;/code&gt; like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// First, we must import the schema creator&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createSchema&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;part:@sanity/base/schema-creator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Then import schema types from any plugins that might expose them&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;schemaTypes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;all:part:@sanity/base/schema-type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;foods&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./foods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;category&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./category&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Then we give our schema to the builder and provide the result to Sanity&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createSchema&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// We name our schema&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Then proceed to concatenate our document type&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// to the ones provided by any plugins that are installed&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;types&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;schemaTypes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;foods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;category&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;]),&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looking deeper at the code above, we imported two files that export the schemas and called them in the types array. At this point, your directory will look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--o_LgYpem--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/llqhdn2tikfvvpyhz07p.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--o_LgYpem--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/llqhdn2tikfvvpyhz07p.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last thing will be for us to load our studio with content which we will be fetching into the app. This is totally up to you; you can get lovely images from &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RtJloxtt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/e59phxdcgmfly6ekzixt.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RtJloxtt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/e59phxdcgmfly6ekzixt.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#connecting-sanity-with-react-app"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Connecting Sanity with React App
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's allow our frontend to query for and receive data from Sanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#connecting-react-to-sanity"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Connecting React to Sanity
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is done by installing the &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sanity/client"&gt;sanity client&lt;/a&gt; package in our React project. Then run this command:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;npm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;sanity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/client @sanity/im&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sanity/client"&gt;@sanity/client&lt;/a&gt; — Sanity Client is the official JavaScript client by Sanity and can be used both in Node.js and modern browsers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sanity/image-url"&gt;@sanity/image-url&lt;/a&gt; — A helper library used to generate image URLs and perform helpful image transformations through the Sanity asset pipeline. Read more on the official docs here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once these packages have been installed, we'll create a new file named &lt;code&gt;client.js&lt;/code&gt; inside the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; directory and add the following code to the &lt;code&gt;client.js&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sanityClient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@sanity/client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sanityClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;projectId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Your Project ID Here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// find this at manage.sanity.io or in your sanity.json&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;dataset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;production&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// this is from those question during 'sanity init'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: To get your project ID, visit &lt;a href="https://www.sanity.io/manage"&gt;https://www.sanity.io/manage&lt;/a&gt;, click on the project, so it displays full info about the project, including the Project ID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Sj0ubF82--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0gfn1wz6sthfbp3iy3i9.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Sj0ubF82--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0gfn1wz6sthfbp3iy3i9.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensure you save the file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#connecting-sanity-to-react"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Connecting Sanity to React
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, You will also need to add the port where the React development server is running to the CORS origins of your Sanity project. Visit &lt;a href="https://www.sanity.io/manage"&gt;https://www.sanity.io/manage&lt;/a&gt; and click on your Sanity project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On your project's dashboard, click on &lt;strong&gt;Settings → API settings&lt;/strong&gt; and then add &lt;a href="http://localhost:3001/"&gt;http://localhost:3000/&lt;/a&gt; to the CORS origins field if it was not added automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--U1Vl4_qq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jyoyq5k6aeiej5j8w78y.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--U1Vl4_qq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jyoyq5k6aeiej5j8w78y.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you save, that will be all for our sanity studio; we can now start building the front end of our app to consume the data from the sanity studio. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#building-a-food-catalog-application"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Building a food catalog application
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to handle would be routing, and this is usually handled in the &lt;code&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file. We'll be implementing this using &lt;code&gt;react-router-dom&lt;/code&gt; and the Switch and Route components. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will create a new folder in the &lt;code&gt;/src&lt;/code&gt; directory to put all our routes in this app. We will have four routes: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;views/Home.js&lt;/code&gt; - The main index is where we will list all the categories fetched from the Sanity studio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;views/Foods.js&lt;/code&gt; - This will contain a random list of all foods fetched from the Sanity studio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;views/About.js&lt;/code&gt; - This is the about page of the application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;views/FilteredFoods.js&lt;/code&gt; - This is an individual page containing foods related to a particular category.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's create the above files, and our file directory will now look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--T8UwNqBb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/v6clo0d88r5y22i75rvy.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--T8UwNqBb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/v6clo0d88r5y22i75rvy.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's now handle routing in the &lt;code&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file. In this file, we will handle routing using React router. This enables the navigation among views of various components in a React Application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing will be to install the React Router package using the command below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;react-router-dom &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--save&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After installing &lt;code&gt;react-router-dom&lt;/code&gt;, add its components (&lt;code&gt;BrowserRouter&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Route&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Switch&lt;/code&gt;) to the &lt;code&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file. You can now proceed to define your routes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the code below, you will notice all the routes are wrapped in the &lt;code&gt;Switch&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;BrowserRouter&lt;/code&gt; components. The &lt;code&gt;Switch&lt;/code&gt; component is used to render only the first route that matches the location, rather than rendering all matching routes, and the &lt;code&gt;BrowserRouter&lt;/code&gt; is a router implementation that uses the HTML5 history API to keep your UI in sync with the URL. It is the parent component that is used to store all the other components. Learn more about routing in react &lt;a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reactjs-router/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;BrowserRouter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Switch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react-router-dom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// views&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Home&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./views/Home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;About&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./views/About&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Foods&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./views/Foods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;FilteredFoods&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./views/FilteredFoods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// styles&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./App.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;BrowserRouter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Switch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;exact&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;About&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/About"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Foods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/Foods"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;FilteredFoods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/FilteredFoods/:slug"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Switch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;BrowserRouter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can confirm if the routes are working, visiting the paths. Now the next thing would be to work on the &lt;code&gt;NavBar&lt;/code&gt; of our application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's now create a folder and name its components in the &lt;code&gt;/src&lt;/code&gt; directory to house all our reusable components. This would help organize our application. In this folder, we have about five different components, but let's start with the Header section of our application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#building-the-header-and-footer-section"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Building the Header and footer Section
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The header section is going to house the application's logo and nav links, while the footer section will contain footer text. We mentioned earlier that React is all about components, so let's make some!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;components/Header.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - This would be the overall container housing the Navbar.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;NavBar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./NavBar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"bg-gray-100"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;NavBar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the above code, we created a functional component and then imported &lt;code&gt;Navbar.js&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;components/NavBar.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - This will contain the logo and all the navigation links.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;NavLink&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react-router-dom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;nav&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"container lg:px-0 px-5 py-2 lg:py-0 lg:w-3/4 w-full mx-auto flex flex-col lg:flex-row justify-between h-20 items-center font-bold"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;NavLink&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"text-xl lg:text-2xl"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;😋Yummy Food's&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;NavLink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;" lg:block"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"flex gap-x-20"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;NavLink&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class="na"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/"&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class="na"&gt;exact&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"nav-link"&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class="na"&gt;activeClassName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"active-link"&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                            Home
                        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;NavLink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;NavLink&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class="na"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/foods"&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"nav-link"&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class="na"&gt;activeClassName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"active-link"&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                            Foods
                        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;NavLink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;NavLink&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class="na"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/about"&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"nav-link"&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class="na"&gt;activeClassName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"active-link"&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                            About
                        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;NavLink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;nav&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the links which we declared in &lt;code&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; to work, we need to import &lt;code&gt;NavLink&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;react-router-dom&lt;/code&gt; and then made use of &lt;code&gt;NavLink&lt;/code&gt; in the navbar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;components/Footer.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - This will contain the footer text, which is very simple.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Footer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"bg-gray-100 flex justify-center font-bold p-5"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Footer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The last thing will be to add &lt;code&gt;Header.js&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Footer.js&lt;/code&gt; files to our &lt;code&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; file, making the app.js file to now look like this&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;BrowserRouter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Switch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react-router-dom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// views&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Home&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./views/Home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;About&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./views/About&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Foods&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./views/Foods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;FilteredFoods&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./views/FilteredFoods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// components&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./components/Header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Footer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./components/Footer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// styles&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./App.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;BrowserRouter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* Header Area */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"max-w-full"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* Route Area */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Switch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;exact&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;About&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/About"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Foods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/Foods"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;FilteredFoods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/FilteredFoods/:slug"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Switch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* Footer Area */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"max-w-full"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Footer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;BrowserRouter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At this stage, when you save, the application will look like this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--A2JZxcCv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lg3342q7aio8dpd4cip0.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--A2JZxcCv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lg3342q7aio8dpd4cip0.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll notice we have a &lt;code&gt;Header&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;Footer&lt;/code&gt; but no content! Let's now work on the index page, so it displays all our categories from Sanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#display-all-food-categories-on-the-homepage"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Display all food categories on the Homepage
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Categories&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../components/Categories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Home&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;section&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"container w-full lg:px-0 px-5 lg:w-3/4 mx-auto"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"flex lg:flex-row flex-col my-10 justify-between"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"text-3xl lg:text-4xl font-bold"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Hello👋&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"text-xl lg:text-2xl"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;What do you want?&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"flex items-center lg:mt-0 mt-5 gap-3 lg:flex-row flex-col"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"text"&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"w-full lg:w-80 p-2 border-2 border-gray-500 rounded focus:outline-none"&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="na"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;backgroundColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;#FE043C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"rounded w-full lg:w-auto px-10 py-3 text-white"&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                        Search
                    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;hr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"my-10"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Categories&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the code above, we have a &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; containing welcome information and a search bar, and then after that, we imported a component called &lt;code&gt;categories&lt;/code&gt; from the components' folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To continue, you will have to create a component and name it &lt;code&gt;Categories.js&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;/components&lt;/code&gt; folder. This is where we will fetch all our food categories from Sanity, either using GROQ or GraphQL. For this guide, we will make use of GROQ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please paste the following code in the &lt;code&gt;Categories.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sanityClient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../Client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Category&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./Category&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Categories&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;categories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCategories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sanityClient&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`*[_type == "category"]{
      title,
      slug,
      description,
      image{
        asset-&amp;gt;{
          _id,
          url
        },
      },
      hexCode,
    }`&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCategories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"text-3xl font-bold text-center my-10 lg:my-5"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                All Categories🥘
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"flex flex-col lg:flex-row lg:justify-center flex-wrap w-full gap-10 my-10"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;categories&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;categories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;category&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Category&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;category&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;category&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;category&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Categories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The above code might seem tricky since we are now fetching data from our Sanity, but I will explain. Let's first understand what GROQ is all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GROQ (Graph-Relational Object Queries) is a declarative language designed to query collections of largely schema-less JSON documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; If you're not yet familiar with GROQ which is used to query Sanity for data, check the official &lt;a href="https://www.sanity.io/docs/groq"&gt;docs here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Explaining the code...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing we did was to import Sanity Client, which we installed earlier.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sanityClient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../Client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In react, we make use of some hooks to query for data. For this guide, we will make use of &lt;code&gt;useState()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;useEffect()&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;useState()&lt;/code&gt; is a Hook that allows you to have state variables in functional components, while &lt;code&gt;useEffect()&lt;/code&gt; lets you perform side effects in function components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make use of these two hooks, you have to import them from react, and that's what we did in the first line alongside react, which is necessary.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can now set our states&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;categories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCategories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: This follows a common pattern where &lt;code&gt;categories&lt;/code&gt; is where we access the current value of that particular piece of state, while &lt;code&gt;setCategories&lt;/code&gt; is our method for setting or changing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fetch data/information from Sanity studio, you can make use of GROQ, let's now explore our Groq Query:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sanityClient&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`*[_type == "category"]{
      title,
      slug,
      description,
      image{
        asset-&amp;gt;{
          _id,
          url
        },
      },
      hexCode,
    }`&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCategories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This query is searching through your Sanity data store, or &lt;a href="https://www.sanity.io/docs/datastore"&gt;Content Lake&lt;/a&gt;, for a schema that has a &lt;code&gt;_type&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;category&lt;/code&gt; (this is the &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; of the schema) and then gets the &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;slug&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;description&lt;/code&gt;, e.t.c.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading further through our code, you'll notice that we are looping through our categories array and mapping each item to an instance of our Category component.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;categories&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;categories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;category&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Category&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;category&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;category&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;category&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;))}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;code&gt;category.js&lt;/code&gt; file, paste the code below and save&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react-router-dom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sanityClient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../Client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;imageUrlBuilder&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@sanity/image-url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;builder&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;imageUrlBuilder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sanityClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;urlFor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;builder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Category&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;category&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"bg-gray-100 rounded-xl p-10 w-full lg:w-1/3"&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;backgroundColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;category&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hexCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="na"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;urlFor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;category&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="na"&gt;alt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;category&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="na"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;backgroundColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;#FE043C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"rounded mt-3 px-5 py-2 text-white"&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    View
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Category&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the above code, we imported &lt;code&gt;imageUrlBuilder&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;@sanity/image-url&lt;/code&gt;, which we use to generate image URLs for our images by creating a method called &lt;code&gt;UrlFor()&lt;/code&gt; and making use of it inside the template. This helps us get thumbnail-sized images compared to the regular size of images uploaded to Sanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: A lot of things can be done with &lt;code&gt;imageUrlBuilder&lt;/code&gt;, such as specifying width and height. You can read more about &lt;code&gt;imageUrlBuilder&lt;/code&gt; here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you save, you will notice the homepage/index page now looks like this, depending on the data you entered into your studio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--F5_p8P9R--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/l37xg9r2m0zx20trh2er.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--F5_p8P9R--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/l37xg9r2m0zx20trh2er.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#display-all-foods-on-foods-page"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Display all foods on Food's page
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as we were able to display all categories on the home page, we will also use the same approach to display all foods on the foods page. In the &lt;code&gt;/views/Foods.js&lt;/code&gt; paste the code below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react-router-dom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sanityClient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../Client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;imageUrlBuilder&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@sanity/image-url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;builder&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;imageUrlBuilder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sanityClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;urlFor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

                                    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/filteredfoods/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;food&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;category&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                                        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;small&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"uppercase text-gray-400 font-semibold"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                                            &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;food&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;category&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
                                        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;small&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                                    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                                &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                                &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"mt-5"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;food&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;foodDesc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Foods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the code above, We are simply fetching all the foods from the &lt;code&gt;foods&lt;/code&gt; schema of our sanity studio. Once you save, you will get something like this, depending on what you have in your sanity studio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--k-gNTsk---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wgefsmocfjd48bmzmoee.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--k-gNTsk---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wgefsmocfjd48bmzmoee.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, let's take a look at something very important; you will notice some links in the foods page and home page, which are supposed to take us to a dynamic route. Let's now see how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-dynamic-routes-for-each-category"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Create dynamic routes for each category
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a dynamic route, we will be making use of a component. We will be making use of the &lt;code&gt;FilteredFoods.js&lt;/code&gt; page, and if you recall, when we were declaring routes, we added a slug to the route of this page&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;FilteredFoods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/FilteredFoods/:slug"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We will get that slug via &lt;code&gt;useParams&lt;/code&gt; which we would import into this component. In the &lt;code&gt;FilteredFoods.js&lt;/code&gt; component, paste the code below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useParams&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react-router-dom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sanityClient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../Client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;imageUrlBuilder&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@sanity/image-url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;builder&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;imageUrlBuilder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sanityClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;urlFor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;builder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Foods&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;filteredFoods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setFilteredFoods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;slug&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useParams&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

                                    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/filteredfoods/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;food&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;category&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                                        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;small&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"uppercase text-gray-400 font-semibold"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                                            &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;food&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;category&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
                                        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;small&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                                    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                                &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                                &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"mt-5"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;food&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;foodDesc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Foods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The code above can be quite tricky, but I will explain everything in plain words. The first thing we did was to import &lt;code&gt;useParams&lt;/code&gt;  which would enable us to get the &lt;code&gt;slug&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;slug&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useParams&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once that is successful, we can now query our sanity studio, but this time around, the query is quite different. To get a feeling for queries in GROQ, you can check their cheat sheet &lt;a href="https://www.sanity.io/docs/query-cheat-sheet"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you save this code, you will now be able to access dynamic routes via the Link declared either in the home page or foods page&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/filteredfoods/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;category&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;slug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;backgroundColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;#FE043C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"rounded mt-3 px-5 py-2 text-white"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        View
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By now, the whole application should be working fine and fast without reloading the browser, we have not yet added any information to the About page, you can paste the code below, so we are sure everything is complete:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;foodsAboutImg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../images/foods-abt-img.jpg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;About&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;section&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"container w-full lg:px-0 px-5 lg:w-3/4 mx-auto min-h-screen"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

                            A healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and
                            low-fat dairy can help to reduce your risk of heart disease by
                            maintaining blood pressure and cholesterol levels. High blood
                            pressure and cholesterol can be a symptom of too much salt and
                            saturated fats in your diet.
                        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

                            Many healthful foods, including vegetables, fruits, and beans, are
                            lower in calories than most processed foods.
                        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

                            Children learn most health-related behaviors from the adults
                            around them, and parents who model healthful eating and exercise
                            habits tend to pass these on.
                        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congratulations!&lt;/strong&gt; We now have our application running smoothly offline. You can decide to deploy your application online so that others can access it easily.&lt;/p&gt;

  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this guide, we built a single-page application with React, Tailwind CSS, and Sanity. This guide will help you set up your own version of this project. You can also improve on it by adding/implementing certain features and functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few ideas to get you started:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add Search functionality to the search field, making use of foods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Style the app using UI libraries like &lt;a href="https://vuetifyjs.com/en/"&gt;Vuetify&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://bootstrap-vue.org/"&gt;BootstrapVue&lt;/a&gt;, or standard CSS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make certain fields of the schema required and play with other field types.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#useful-resources"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--i19B7XMW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1%2A2VY724Akzpg1M4ZnS-b4Mw.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--i19B7XMW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1%2A2VY724Akzpg1M4ZnS-b4Mw.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a developer or web designer, when you create a web form, you need to specify some &lt;em&gt;action.&lt;/em&gt; The action is a URL or endpoint that your form will be sent. Meaning that you need a backend (code) that receives your form and send you email notifications, saves the data, and something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;strong&gt;what happens if I don’t know how to create a backend&lt;/strong&gt;? Or what happens if I &lt;strong&gt;don’t wanna create backend for a simple form&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For &lt;strong&gt;that reason&lt;/strong&gt;, I’ve created &lt;a href="https://www.actionforms.io/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ActionForms.io&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#actionformsio-is-a-no-code%E2%80%8A%E2%80%8Ano-backend-form-sender-for-developers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ActionForms.io is a No code — No backend Form sender for developers.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.actionforms.io/"&gt;ActionForms.io&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;you can easily send your&lt;/strong&gt; contact &lt;strong&gt;forms&lt;/strong&gt;, surveys, questions, any form or request that you can imagine &lt;strong&gt;without coding or configuring a backend.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-can-i-get-slack-notifications-from-my-contact-forms"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How can I get Slack notifications from my Contact Forms?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, you need an &lt;a href="https://www.actionforms.io/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ActionForms.io account&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it’s really &lt;strong&gt;simple&lt;/strong&gt; and there is a free plan if you want to &lt;strong&gt;try it&lt;/strong&gt;! :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, you have to create an “Endpoint”. An Endpoint is a URL where your requests will be sent to the &lt;a href="https://www.actionforms.io/"&gt;ActionForms.io&lt;/a&gt; platform. When you log in to your account, you’ll see a button that you can create &lt;strong&gt;Unlimited Endpoints:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---2J3TJh1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1%2AJuEzodozxOJEDWYVLfVA4w.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---2J3TJh1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1%2AJuEzodozxOJEDWYVLfVA4w.png" alt="Create ActionForms.io endpoint"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s begin writing the basic information for the Endpoint, we need a Name (What you want. Ex: Contact form — Website) and the URL slug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mcWayWl6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1%2AKTHZiPYUEkHq7lKDxsVV_Q.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mcWayWl6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1%2AKTHZiPYUEkHq7lKDxsVV_Q.png" alt="Create ActionForms.io endpoint with Basic information"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good! &lt;strong&gt;Now we have an active endpoint ready to receive form requests.&lt;/strong&gt; If we look into our &lt;em&gt;Endpoint Edit page&lt;/em&gt; we’ll see the &lt;strong&gt;Slack Notifications&lt;/strong&gt; menu, let’s click it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Xqj1h2FO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1%2AzZX_5dIyIIIoh2ew9wUkTA.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Xqj1h2FO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1%2AzZX_5dIyIIIoh2ew9wUkTA.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-configure-slack-notifications-webhook-in-actionformsio"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to configure Slack Notifications Webhook in ActionForms.io
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are at the Slack Notifications configuration page. We only need one thing: &lt;strong&gt;Webhook Url.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I get the Slack Webhook Url?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have three steps tutorial inside the same configuration page, but let me show you how to do it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--r5Inu-Xz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1%2AuJbP_PdTsMyarzZvi_2UNA.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--r5Inu-Xz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1%2AuJbP_PdTsMyarzZvi_2UNA.png" alt="ActionForms.io Slack webhooks steps"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, we need to click on this link:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This link will redirect us to a Slack page that will ask us to install an App to our Slack workspace. This app is called &lt;strong&gt;Incoming Webhooks&lt;/strong&gt; and allows you to receive notifications via Slack from external sources, like &lt;a href="https://www.actionforms.io/"&gt;ActionForms.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--P_Dvlarq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1%2AV72jytVdx6hOhbjumxQ3TA.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--P_Dvlarq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1%2AV72jytVdx6hOhbjumxQ3TA.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are already logged in to your Slack workspace, then click &lt;strong&gt;Add to Slack&lt;/strong&gt; button to install Incoming Webhooks in your workspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#select-the-channel-to-receive-notifications"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Select the channel to receive notifications&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After installing Incoming Webhooks (in just one click), you need to choose the Channel that you will receive the incoming notifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can create a channel specifically to receive notifications, or just select what you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HqCZQgia--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1%2AtpcznVzjm6sryGVrRaMdRw.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HqCZQgia--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1%2AtpcznVzjm6sryGVrRaMdRw.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good, just one more step!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you selected the channel, you’ll see the &lt;strong&gt;Webhook URL&lt;/strong&gt; right there:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--p97v3Vpm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1%2AHDcmamYLOj0nUIod2YZr8w.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--p97v3Vpm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1%2AHDcmamYLOj0nUIod2YZr8w.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just copy this Webhook URL into ActionForms.io page that we opened before (Endpoint -&amp;gt; Slack notifications):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--76fcDupQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1%2AKbwpxo-gs_0st9aEPXoNAQ.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--76fcDupQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1%2AKbwpxo-gs_0st9aEPXoNAQ.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And that’s it!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Save it and you can test your notifications using the button “Send test Request” that just appears at the top of the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1qLH1XiO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1%2AqzBw4Fd1ZEoRbe7jlML_FQ.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1qLH1XiO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1%2AqzBw4Fd1ZEoRbe7jlML_FQ.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
