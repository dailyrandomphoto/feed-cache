      <description>&lt;p&gt;When someone asks you "who are you?", the first thing that you might think to say is your title, like "I'm a doctor" or "I'm an engineer." But, is that really you? Are you your title and is your career your life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, I'm not judging. I just want to put the cards on the table. Try to think about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case, probably the answer would be &lt;strong&gt;YES&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I built my life around my career. I'm not sure if it's bad or not. But I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a lot of sacrifices to be where I am now. I changed everything and almost everyone around me in favor of my career. Most of these changes I did and not realized them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My life dream was to get a degree. So when I was at university I put this goal in front of any other. No matter how hard I needed to study. I did not relax til I realized this goal. At that time, my degree was my life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was really focused on finishing my studies. So I stopped to going out at night, stopped seeing some friends, stopped talking with loved ones and I did not realize that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I changed myself and my lifestyle in favor of this goal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really don't miss most of those things. Go to parties at night and expend my sleeping hours on that? Thanks, but not anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My degree was just one step toward the &lt;strong&gt;main goal&lt;/strong&gt;: my dev career. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I got that, I had &lt;strong&gt;another goal&lt;/strong&gt;: work with a hot tech and be better paid. So I started to focus on this goal, staying at home most of time and not caring about anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a lot of weekends building projects just to practice and getting better at that. Hang with friends? Not really. Nothing was more important than showing Captain Marvel comics using React. (I loved that project)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So I changed my weekends to achieve this, and I did.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next goal&lt;/strong&gt;: talk in english with confidence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I changed everything around me to English: smartphone, MacBook, TV shows. If something could be in English, it is now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never liked to watch TV series, I always saw that as a waste of time. But I changed my mind just to study English and practice my listening skills. So again, I changed myself in favor of a goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear for me that my career is my life, because I built and shaped it around me. Of course I had a lot of losses on that. But most were wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it dangerous to think this way? Maybe. &lt;strong&gt;I'm not a workaholic and no one should be.&lt;/strong&gt; But of course to achieve some goals in life, I think you have to change yourself. In my case it has been worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I just can't see myself only as Jeniffer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I'm a happy and proud software engineer, and by the way my name is Jeniffer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>C++ is awesome, here's why...</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/vinitjogani/c-is-awesome-here-s-why-1be0</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fgXoQaV2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hdkde0ewkautm4ytvft0.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fgXoQaV2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hdkde0ewkautm4ytvft0.jpg" alt="17262-art-file-color-nav_a1095839-fec0-48e0-ac70-05af2f9d3cf2_650x650"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C++ is, hands down, one of the most misunderstood languages in software developer pop culture today. People often compare it to C because it is a "low-level" language. Consequently, it has received a reputation of being an esoteric language that only the performance paranoid care about. This is far from true. I have been programming in C++ as my primary language for a while now and the developer experience is actually really good -- much better than I had imagined it would be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, I want to debunk some common myths about C++ that I heard before I started using it. Then, I want to talk about the actual superpowers that C++ provides you that most other languages do not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#myth-1-memory-this-memory-that"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Myth 1: memory this, memory that
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know that C is infamous for manual memory management e.g. with the &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt;. They are hard to work with, lead to many error conditions that need to manually be checked for, and is overall a nightmare. When people hear that C++ also has great performance, people assume that it is by dabbling into all the specifics of memory allocation much like in C so they conclude that it would also be a nightmare. This is categorically false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a while now, C++ has had smart pointers. Using these, you can get the same behavior as you get with objects in other languages like Java and Python. In particular, the &lt;code&gt;std::shared_ptr&lt;/code&gt; works by wrapping a regular object in a copy-able and movable object with a reference counting mechanism. Thus, when no code is referencing a &lt;code&gt;shared_ptr&lt;/code&gt;, it is safely destructed and freed like in most languages. The simplest way to construct a shared pointer is as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;std::shared_ptr cat(new Pet("cat"));
// or
std::shared_ptr cat = std::make_shared&amp;lt;Pet&amp;gt;("cat");
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While this is the common pattern in most other languages, C++ allows you to have further control on how an object is accessed e.g. using a &lt;code&gt;unique_ptr&lt;/code&gt;, but more on that later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, with smart pointers, managing memory in C++ is no harder than any other languages. It is, however, &lt;em&gt;intentional&lt;/em&gt; in that you need to clarify that this is your expected behavior because you can still create and pass around regular pointers the good (ugly?) old way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, with good use of these, you are also very unlikely to run into segmentation faults which were oh-so-common in C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#myth-2-it-is-old-and-outdated"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Myth 2: it is old and outdated
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C++ is very actively maintained with new features that continue to be rolled out at a regular basis. I think one of the most common "new" features in many languages that people have grown to admire is lambdas. Surely, C++ doesn't have lambdas right? Wrong. A C++ lambda function can be defined as:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;auto square = [=](int x) { return x * x; };
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For context, Java got lambdas in 2014 with the release of Java 8. C++ has had lambdas since C++11 (2011). Yep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there continue to be major updates e.g. C++20 most recently, that introduce even more features to make C++ easier to work with. For example, variable-length arguments have been in C++ for a while with variadic templates. Generics work great in C++ as well, although differently from what you may be used to in Java. These features continue to improve the way we develop software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#myth-3-it-is-easy-to-get-wrong"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Myth 3: it is easy to get wrong
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, while learning some of its quirks may take a while, C++ makes it very hard for your code to do undesired things. For example, many object-oriented languages do not have support for "pure" functions i.e. functions that are guaranteed to be immutable. In C++, you can actually mark methods of a class as &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; if they don't modify the class' state. These methods can then also be called on constant instances of the class. Here's an example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Greeting {
public:
Greeting(std::string greeting) : greeting_(greeting) {}

std::string get_greeting() const { 
  return greeting_; 
}

std::string set_greeting(std::string new_) { 
  greeting_ = new_; 
}

private:
std::string greeting_;
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, you can initialize this class as a constant and still call the getter. If you try to mutate the state of the class, the compiler will complain!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const Greeting g("hello");
g.get_greeting(); // returns "hello"
g.set_greeting("hi"); // does not compile
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To be accurate, these functions are not fully pure in that if you don't type some of your variables correctly, it is possible to mutate the resources. For example, if you have a &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; pointer to a non-&lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; object, you may not modify the pointer but can modify the object pointed to by the pointer. However, these problems can typically be avoided by typing the pointer correctly (i.e. making it a &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; pointer to a &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; object). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may seem like I am self-contradicting here by mentioning such an edge case in a common use case. However, I don't think it really contradicts what my larger claim here is: C++ makes it hard to go wrong assuming you know what you want by giving you the tools to express exactly that in code. While programming languages like Python might abstract it all away from you, they come at a much higher cost. Imagine going into an ice cream shop and only having chocolate served to you because that's what most people generally want -- that's Python. Depending on how you look at it, sure in some sense it is harder to go wrong with chocolate, in general it is not upto the shop but the user to know what they need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt;-ness is a big plus but there's several other things that C++ allow you to do that prevent production bugs from occurring in larger projects. It allows you to configure move/copy/delete semantics for the classes you design if you need. It allows you to pass things by value and advanced features like multiple inheritance. All these things make C++ less restrictive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#myth-4-it-is-verbose"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Myth 4: it is verbose
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, this is not completely inaccurate. Coming from Python, where folks are so tired of typing &lt;code&gt;numpy&lt;/code&gt; that they just collectively all decided to import it as &lt;code&gt;np&lt;/code&gt;, typing more than 2 letters does feel verbose. But modern C++ is a lot less verbose than it used to be! For example, type inference like Go is available in C++ with the introduction of the &lt;code&gt;auto&lt;/code&gt; keyword.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;auto x = 1;
x = 2; // works
x = "abc"; // compilation error
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can also use &lt;code&gt;auto&lt;/code&gt; in return types:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;auto func(int x) { return x * x; }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can also use it in for loops to loop over maps for example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;for (auto&amp;amp; [key, value]: hashmap) {...}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;auto&lt;/code&gt; does not mean that the types are dynamic -- they are still inferred at compile time and once assigned, they cannot be changed. This is probably for the best. In practice for large codebases, it arguably also helps readability to specifically type out the full type instead of using &lt;code&gt;auto&lt;/code&gt;. However, the feature is there if you need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also specify type and/or namespace aliases like in Python. For example, you can do something like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;using tf = tensorflow;
// Now you can use tf::Example instead of tensorflow::Example.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;C++ templates (similar to Java Generics, but pretty different at the same time) can also help significantly cut down duplicate code and may be an elegant solution for many use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, C++ is definitely more verbose than many new programming languages like Kotlin and Python. However, it is not a lot more verbose than C# or Java or even JavaScript to some extent, and the verbosity of those languages has not affected their popularity too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#myth-5-hard-to-do-common-things"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Myth 5: hard to do common things
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, this is not completely inaccurate. Common operations like joining strings by a delimiter are more complicated than they need to be. However, this is a problem solved rather easily with open source libraries like Google's &lt;a href="https://abseil.io/"&gt;Abseil&lt;/a&gt; with thousands of utility functions that make it very easy to work with. Apart from string utilities, Abseil also contains special implementations of hashmaps, concurrency helpers, and debugging tools. Other libraries like Boost make it easy to work with BLAS routines (e.g. dot products, matrix multiplications, etc.) and are very performant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using libraries itself can be a challenging task in C++ with having to maintain &lt;code&gt;CMake&lt;/code&gt; files, although in many ways those are not much different from the &lt;code&gt;gradle&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; files in other languages. However, again Google's open source build tool &lt;a href="https://bazel.build/"&gt;Bazel&lt;/a&gt; makes it extremely easy to work with even with cross-language builds. It takes some getting used to, but provides really quick builds and in general has a very good developer experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#superpowers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Superpowers
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after busting all those common myths about C++, here are some things in C++ that a lot of other languages don't allow you to do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#customize-semantics-of-your-classes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Customize semantics of your classes
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose you have a class that contains some large data. You would prefer it not be copied and instead be passed by reference always. You can enforce this as a designer of the interface. Moreover, you can configure exactly how you would like it to be copied if at all it is required. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about moving objects -- instead of copying all data from the previous block of memory to a new block and then deleting the old block of memory, maybe you can optimize it by just switching the pointer locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about destroying objects -- when a object goes out of scope, maybe you automatically want to release some resources (e.g. think mutexes that are automatically released at the end of the function). This works much like the &lt;code&gt;defer&lt;/code&gt; functionality in Go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a designer of an interface, you can customize every small aspect of how users will use your class. In most cases, this is not necessary but when it is, C++ allows you to fully express your requirements. That is very powerful and can save your company hours of time on large projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#optimize-memory-access"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Optimize memory access
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I briefly mentioned smart pointers above. Apart from &lt;code&gt;shared_ptr&lt;/code&gt;, you can also have a &lt;code&gt;unique_ptr&lt;/code&gt; that ensures that only one object can own a resource. Having one owner for  data makes it easy to organize and reason about large projects. In fact, while &lt;code&gt;shared_ptr&lt;/code&gt; most closely mimics Java and other OOP languages, you're generally better off using a &lt;code&gt;unique_ptr&lt;/code&gt;. This also adds to the safety of the language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also specify compile-time constants to enable the compiler to do more work during the build so that the binary runs faster overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#strong-types"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Strong types
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, I have found that working with typed objects is SO much easier to debug than other languages. For example, after hours of debugging a JavaScript project, I found that the error arose because I was passing in 1 argument to a 2 argument function. JavaScript threw no errors and just produced undesired outputs. I would much rather have something fail to compile than fail during runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are many typed languages out there so it may seem overkill to use this as a super power. But C++ does more. First of all, C++ lets you pass anything by reference, by pointer or by value. That means you can pass in a reference to an integer and have a function mutate it instead of using the return value (might be handy in some cases). It also means that you can perform memory-level operations using a pointer on anything if need be. Usually, though, you would like to pass things as a constant reference (e.g. &lt;code&gt;const A&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;) which does not lead to a copy and keeps your object safe from being mutated unintentionally. Those are strong guarantees to have and that makes your code just so much easier to reason about. In typescript, for example, you cannot reassign a &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; object but you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; mutate it. Why even -- just uggh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#caveats"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Caveats
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So C++ is great and all, but there are obvious limitations to what I would use it for. You can write microservices (e.g. in gRPC) rather easily but I would likely not use C++ for the actual web server (I would likely use TypeScript for that). Despite its speed, I would likely not use C++ for data analysis (I would likely use &lt;code&gt;pandas&lt;/code&gt; for that). There are some things that C++ is great for and there are other things that it's just not suitable for. Ultimately, you still have to choose the right tool for whatever job you're trying to accomplish. Having said that, hopefully this article made C++ a bit more attractive in your eyes than you're used to seeing it as.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Separation of concerns: Templates,  Component</title>
      <author>Takuya Kikuchi</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/takuyakikuchi/separation-of-concerns-templates-component-5h3p</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7cQ3mrcKaY&amp;amp;list=WL&amp;amp;index=1&amp;amp;t=6s"&gt;Pete Hunt: React: Rethinking best practices -- JSConf EU - YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-separation-of-concerns"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is "Separation of concerns"
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the idea that each module or layer in an application should only be responsible for one thing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce coupling, Increase cohesion

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;coupling: each modules relies on each of the other modules, cascading changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cohesion: elements of a module belong together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#templates"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Templates
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Templates encourage a poor separation of concerns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"View model" tightly couples templates to display logic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;display logic and markup are inevitably tightly coupled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;display logic and markup are highly cohesive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Templates separate technologies, not concerns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#react-component"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  React Component
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A highly cohesive building block for UIs loosely coupled with other components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;composable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#take-aways"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Take aways
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separation of concerns !== Separate technologies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#all"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  All
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Return "all" error messages as object of fields with list of their error messages&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#force-macro"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Force Macro
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Force macro acts the same as macro, with the option to forcefully override core functions and already existing macros.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Use with caution).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note See forceLocalMacro to only apply the method on a specific instance instead of globally on the prototype constructor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Output: 'Name field is required, Name field can not be greater than 3 characters, Name field must be a string'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#forget"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Forget
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forget error messages on all fields or optionally on a specific field&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Forget errors messages for all fields&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// only forget the error messages for a specific field&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#get"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Get
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get first available error message on a given field&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#has"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Has
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check if a specific field "has" error messages&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;has&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#list"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  List
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;List all error messages or optionally list all array messages for a specific field&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ['Name is a required field']&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ['Name is a required field']&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ['Email field must be an email', 'Email is a required field']&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#macro"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Macro
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extend errors message bag instance using macros&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note See localMacro to only apply the method on a specific instance instead of globally on the prototype constructor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// errors().count() === errors().list().count();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#set"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Set
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set all error messages, or optionally set given fields error messages&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Customize rule error messages&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Globally, each rule provides a default error message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easily override rule's default error message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simply pass 'messages' to our validator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only override messages you want to
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;```js bash&lt;br&gt;
import validator from 'vuejs-validators';&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;let data = { name: '', email: '' };&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;let rules = {&lt;br&gt;
    name: ['min:3', 'max:12', 'string', 'required'],&lt;br&gt;
    email: ['email', 'required']&lt;br&gt;
};&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;let messages = {&lt;br&gt;
    'name.min': 'Whoops! :attribute is less than :min characters',&lt;br&gt;
    'name.required': 'Wha oh, doesnt look like there any value for your :attribute field',&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;'email.email': 'Really? Email is called Email...it has to be an email...',
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;};&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;let validation = validator(input, rules, messages)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;

## Extending: Custom Rules
&amp;gt; `Add Your Own Validation Rules`

- Easily add, or override, validation rules
- Add a group of rules at a time
- Add a single rule add a time

### Extending: Custom Rules ~ Add Single Rule
&amp;gt; `validator.extend(name, [message, rule])`


```js
validator(data, rules).extend('uppercase', [
    ':attribute must be uppercase',
    ({ value, validator, parameters }) =&amp;gt; value === value.toUpperCase(),
]);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#extending-custom-rules-add-multiple-rules"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Extending: Custom Rules ~ Add Multiple Rules
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;validator.extend({ first: [message, rule], second: [message, rule], etc... })&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;validation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;extend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;uppercase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;:attribute must be uppercase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;em&gt;you may need the entire validation "context" object.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;To see the entirety of our provided validation context, hook into&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;a rule validator method, pass through a single; non-deconstructed parameter,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;and console.log it (Checkout the example directly below)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;email.min&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;:attribute may not be less than :min&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;email.max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;:attribute may not be more than :max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;password.same&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;:attribute must have the same value as :same&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;password.min&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;:attribute may not be less than :min&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;phone_number.phone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;:attribute must be a valid phone number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;terms_of_service:truthy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;:attribute must have a truthy value ("on", "On", "yes", "Yes", "1", 1, true, "true")&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;terms_of_service:required&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;:attribute is required&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;validator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;rules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;messages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;validate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

      <title>easy way to print charts in vue js</title>
      <author>Sudhanshu Singh</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 24 Jul 2021 00:56:04 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/justsubh01/easy-way-to-print-charts-in-vue-js-3j9e</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/justsubh01/easy-way-to-print-charts-in-vue-js-3j9e</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chart.js&lt;/strong&gt; is a powerful and easiest way to create charts in &lt;strong&gt;vuejs&lt;/strong&gt;, we use HTML5  element for print the graphs. With Vue’s data() object, it is possible to store data and manipulate it to change graphs when needed.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will do this task in 3 steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-1-setting-up-the-project"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Step 1 - Setting up the project:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;create new project-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;vue create chart_example --default&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;navigate to project directory-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd chart_example&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;install &lt;strong&gt;Chart.js&lt;/strong&gt; in our project-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install chart.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-2-creating-component-for-chart"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Step 2 - creating component for chart&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to print &lt;code&gt;line chart&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;dataset&lt;/code&gt; of corona cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;create &lt;code&gt;CoronaCases.vue&lt;/code&gt; file and insert below code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;src/components/CoronaCases.vue&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;template&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;canvas id="corona-chart"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/canvas&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/template&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;
import Chart from 'chart.js/auto'
import coronaData from '../coronaData.js'

export default {
    name: 'CoronaCases',
    data(){
        return {
            coronaData: coronaData
        }
    },
    mounted() {
        const ctx = document.getElementById('corona-chart');
        new Chart(ctx, this.coronaData);
}
}
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;here &lt;code&gt;coronaData.js&lt;/code&gt; file contains our data(it defines in next step).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a chart with Chart.js resembles the following:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;const ctx = document.getElementById('example');&lt;br&gt;
const exampleChart = new Chart(ctx, {&lt;br&gt;
  type: '',&lt;br&gt;
  data: [],&lt;br&gt;
  options: {},&lt;br&gt;
});&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;canvas&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element is passed in along with a type, data, and options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-3-creating-the-chart-data"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Step 3 - Creating the Chart data&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will define our data separate from main &lt;code&gt;CoronaCases.vue&lt;/code&gt; file. create &lt;code&gt;coronaData.js&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; folder;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;src/coronaData.js&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;export const coronaData = {
    type: "line",
    data: {
        labels: ["2020-01-24","2020-02-01","2020-02-07","2020-02-14","2020-02-21","2020-02-28","2020-03-06","2020-03-13","2020-03-20"],
        datasets: [
            {
                label: "World",
                data: [282, 4593,  20630,  43103,  73332, 80239,  90869, 113702, 179112],
                borderColor: "green",
                borderWidth:3
            },
            {
                label: "China",
                data: [278, 4537,  20471,  42708,  72528, 77262,  79968, 80859, 81116],
                borderColor: "red",
                borderWidth:3
            },
            {
                label: "Italy",
                data: [0, 0,  2,  3,  76, 124,  1128, 10149, 27980],
                borderColor: "Blue",
                borderWidth:3
            },
        ]
    },
    options: {
        responsive: true,
        lineTension: 1,
        scales: {
          yAxes: [
            {
              ticks: {
                beginAtZero: true,
                padding: 25
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
};

export default coronaData;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, you will modify the App.vue file to use the new &lt;code&gt;CoronaCases.vue&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;src/App.vue&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;template&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;div id="app" class="App"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;CoronaCases/&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/template&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;
import CoronaCases from '@/components/CoronaCases';

export default {
  name: 'App',
  components: {
    CoronaCases
  }
}
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now go to the terminal and fire the below command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Git is a version control tool that any developer would benefit from learning. Using git allows you to save your code as you make changes, and you can see what changes have been made over time. When working with other developers, knowing git makes it easy to collaborate on projects. This includes open-source and side projects as well as when you are working on a dev team. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I've had practice using Git. I feel pretty good with the basics such as setting up new projects on GitHub, creating branches, resolving conflicts, and contributing to open source or other team projects. I tend to stick to the git commands most familiar to me without trying new concepts, so I'm ready to step things up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#whats-your-git-level"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What's your git level?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing your git level of knowledge is the first step to improve your skills. Samuel Faure wrote &lt;a href="https://dev.to/samuelfaure/how-to-learn-git-slowly-38fa"&gt;How to Learn Git Slowly&lt;/a&gt; where he outlines six levels of knowledge. Refer to Samuel's guide as it can serve as a roadmap for your git level-up strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#here-are-some-ideas-and-free-git-resources-to-help-you-boost-your-git-knowhow"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Here are some ideas and free git resources to help you boost your git know-how:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ebooks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  E-Books
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E-books can serve as resources you come back to whenever you want to review a concept or look something up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2"&gt;Pro Git book&lt;/a&gt;, written by &lt;a href="https://scottchacon.com/"&gt;Scott Chacon&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href="https://ben.straub.cc/"&gt;Ben Straub&lt;/a&gt;, is a good resource for a variety of git concepts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get step-by-step guidance with the &lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/step-to-step-ebook-to-learn-the-git-and-github-basics-ag4833pd"&gt;Introduction to Git and Github e-book&lt;/a&gt; created by &lt;a href="https://bobbyiliev.com/"&gt;Bobby Iliev&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#git-cheat-sheets"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Git Cheat Sheets
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep git cheat sheets handy as you work. You might also want to create one of your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="http://up1.github.io/git-guide/index.html"&gt;Simple Guide to Git&lt;/a&gt; gives you the most common commands you need to get started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check your knowledge by going through these &lt;a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-cheat-sheet/"&gt;50 Git Commands You Should Know&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#git-courses"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Git Courses
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dedicate some time to complete a git course and keep applying your knowledge through the course material or with your side projects. Check out these courses which vary in length depending on how you want to structure your learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-git-5-day-challenge"&gt;The Ultimate Git 5-Day Challenge&lt;/a&gt; from Udemy by &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/briangorman/"&gt;Brian Gorman&lt;/a&gt; is great for those who are new to git and want to get a step-by-step overview of getting setup with git on Github or Bitbucket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gymnasium has an &lt;a href="https://thegymnasium.com/courses/GYM/006/0/about"&gt;Introduction to Git and GitHub course&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://designers.hubspot.com/blog/author/jeff-ausura"&gt;Jeff Ausura &lt;/a&gt; that you can complete in about an hour or less. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a block of hours to spare, check out &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/git-expert-4-hours/"&gt;Git: Become an Expert in Git &amp;amp; GitHub in 4 Hours&lt;/a&gt; from Udemy by  &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/jad-khalili/"&gt;Jad Khalili&lt;/a&gt; to get intensive git training in a short amount of time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/version-control-with-git"&gt;Version Control with Git&lt;/a&gt; through Coursera offered by &lt;a href="https://www.atlassian.com/"&gt; Atlassian&lt;/a&gt; is a 4-week course that takes you through creating a repository, creating branches, merging, workflows, and more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are new to the open source world, learn &lt;a href="https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github"&gt;How to Contribute to an Open Source project on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; with  &lt;a href="https://kentcdodds.com/"&gt;Kent C. Dodds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observe various git commands in action with the &lt;a href="https://egghead.io/courses/practical-git-for-everyday-professional-use"&gt;Practical Git For Everyday Professional Use&lt;/a&gt; course taught by  &lt;a href="https://github.com/trevordmiller"&gt;Trevor Miller&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#interactive-resources"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Interactive Resources
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to learn something is to practice it, so give these two resources a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href="https://gitimmersion.com/index.html"&gt;Git Immersion&lt;/a&gt;, you'll complete short challenges on your local computer as you learn basic git commands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://learngitbranching.js.org/"&gt;Learning Git Branching&lt;/a&gt; guides you through visuals as you use git commands and create branches.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pair-program-with-others"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Pair program with others
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a mentor or work with a team of developers, take some time to pair program. Not only will you improve your coding skills, you'll have a chance to see the other developer's techniques with git. To them, their methods might come naturally so they may not think what they are doing is anything special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#watch-developer-live-streams-or-tutorials"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Watch developer live streams or tutorials
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You typically watch a live coding session for the actual content, but there is also another layer of learning by noticing how the developer works with git and uses various commands and shortcuts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you understand git, you find this common ground among many kinds of developers who also use git. Taking the time to practice git and dive deeper into the various levels of knowledge will help you become a better developer and teammate. Being well-versed with git could help you stand out when applying for jobs and well as making you better prepared when being onboarded to a new company or team. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's your git story? Are you new or a pro with git? Any helpful tips you can share?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>5 Helpful Python Math Module Methods</title>
      <author>Aya Bouchiha</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 24 Jul 2021 00:38:10 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/ayabouchiha/5-helpful-python-math-module-methods-44gf</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/ayabouchiha/5-helpful-python-math-module-methods-44gf</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi, my name is &lt;a href="https://t.me/AyaBouchiha"&gt;Aya Bouchiha&lt;/a&gt;, today, we are going to discuss 5 methods from the math module that you will probably use in your next project!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a &lt;em&gt;javascript developer&lt;/em&gt;, I recommend to you this article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/ayabouchiha/your-complete-guide-to-math-object-in-javascript"&gt;Your Complete Guide To Math Object in Javascript&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#mathfloor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  math.floor()
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;math.floor()&lt;/strong&gt;: rounds a number down to the nearest integer.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;floor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;floor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.89&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;floor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;7.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;floor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;10.14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# -11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#mathceil"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  math.ceil()
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;math.ceil()&lt;/strong&gt; rounds a number up to the next largest integer.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ceil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ceil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.89&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ceil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;7.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ceil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;10.14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# -10
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#mathtrunc"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  math.trunc()
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;math.trunc()&lt;/strong&gt;: returns the integer part of a number by deleting any fractional digits. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're confiused with &lt;em&gt;math.trunc()&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;math.floor()&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;math.ceil()&lt;/em&gt;, you need to know that &lt;em&gt;math.trunc()&lt;/em&gt; plays exactly the role of &lt;strong&gt;math.floor()&lt;/strong&gt; when the giving number is &lt;strong&gt;positive&lt;/strong&gt;, and It play the role of &lt;strong&gt;math.ceil()&lt;/strong&gt; if the giving number is &lt;strong&gt;negative&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;trunc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.000000000000000001&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 0
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;trunc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;trunc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;8.999999999999999999&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;trunc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;7.8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# -7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#mathsqrt"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  math.sqrt()
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;math.sqrt()&lt;/strong&gt;: returns the square root of the giving &lt;strong&gt;positive&lt;/strong&gt; number.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sqrt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 2.0
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sqrt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 5.0
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sqrt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 10.0
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sqrt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 4.0
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#mathdegrees"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  math.degrees()
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;math.degrees()&lt;/strong&gt;: this method returns the degrees of a given angle in radians.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;pi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pi&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;degrees&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 57.29577951308232

      <description>&lt;p&gt;¡Hola gente bonita!👋&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hay una última manera en la que un elemento puede recibir estilos: la herencia. La cascada se confunde frecuentemente con el concepto de herencia. Aunque los dos temas están relacionados, debes entender cada uno por separado. Si quieres conocer sobre la cascada te invito a leer mi articulo de este tema:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag__link"&gt;
  &lt;a href="/lupitacode" class="ltag__link__link"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ltag__link__pic"&gt;
      &lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0cJFC8qv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xuJnJZ8M--/c_fill%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_150%2Cq_auto%2Cw_150/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/profile_image/617393/67c4df49-d9b4-4361-a19f-a1a31486dec7.png" alt="lupitacode"&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="/lupitacode/la-cascada-en-css-que-es-y-como-funciona-31cd" class="ltag__link__link"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ltag__link__content"&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;La Cascada en CSS: Qué es y cómo funciona&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;Lupita Code 🌄 ・ Jun 22 ・ 13 min read&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;div class="ltag__link__taglist"&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#css&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#html&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#codenewbie&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#spanish&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#qu%C3%A9-es-la-herencia"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  👨‍👦 ¿Qué es la herencia?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vamos a comenzar por una analogía que me gusta usar mucho.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Muchas veces los niños y niñas heredan rasgos de sus padres: el color de los ojos, el color del cabello, la estatura, etc. A veces heredamos rasgos de antepasados más lejanos, como abuelos o bisabuelos. La metáfora de las relaciones familiares también forma parte de la estructura del HTML. Y al igual que las personas, las etiquetas HTML pueden heredar propiedades CSS de sus antepasados.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Los descendientes (piense en hijos y nietos) heredan propiedades de los ancestros (piense en padres y abuelos).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La herencia es el proceso por el cual algunas propiedades CSS aplicadas a una etiqueta se pasan a las etiquetas anidadas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Si un elemento no tiene un valor en cascada para una determinada propiedad, puede heredar uno de un elemento antecesor. Es común aplicar la propiedad &lt;code&gt;font-family&lt;/code&gt; al elemento &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Todas las etiquetas descendientes de la etiqueta &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, es decir, las que están dentro de la etiqueta &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; heredarán esta fuente y no es necesario aplicarla explícitamente a cada elemento de la página.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTA: Cualquier etiqueta dentro de otra etiqueta es descendiente de esa etiqueta. por ejemplo, una etiqueta &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; dentro de la etiqueta &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; es descendiente de &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, mientras que la etiqueta &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; es un ancestro de la etiqueta &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;La herencia también funciona a través de múltiples generaciones. Si una etiqueta como &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; o &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; aparece dentro de una etiqueta &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, entonces las etiquetas &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; y &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; también &lt;br&gt;
heredan las propiedades de cualquier estilo aplicado a la etiqueta &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;La siguiente imagen muestra cómo la herencia fluye hacia abajo en el árbol del DOM. Las propiedades heredadas se transfieren por el árbol DOM desde los nodos padres a sus descendientes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4eJDnT5x--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xptrm0otvatj9idia7o6.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4eJDnT5x--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xptrm0otvatj9idia7o6.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Como puedes notar en la estructura del árbol cada elemento solo tiene un padre directo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#no-todas-las-propiedades-se-heredan"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ❌ No todas las propiedades se heredan
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;La herencia no es todopoderosa, no todas las propiedades se heredan. Por defecto, sólo algunas, las que son principalmente propiedades que pertenecen al texto:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;font&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;font-family&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;font-size&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;font-weight&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;font-variant&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;font-style&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;line-height&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;letter-spacing&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;text-align&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;text-indent&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;text-transform&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;white-space&lt;/code&gt;, y &lt;code&gt;word-spacing&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;También se heredan algunas otras, como las propiedades de la lista:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;list-style&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;list-style-type&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;list-style-position&lt;/code&gt;, y &lt;code&gt;list-style-image&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Las propiedades del borde de la tabla, &lt;code&gt;border-collapse&lt;/code&gt; y &lt;code&gt;border-spacing&lt;/code&gt;, también se heredan. Tenga en cuenta que éstas controlan el comportamiento de los bordes de las tablas, NO las propiedades para especificar los bordes de los elementos que no son tablas. No queremos que un &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; pasara su borde a todos los elementos descendientes ¿Verdad?.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Como podemos ver la herencia no siempre se aplica, y eso NO es necesariamente algo malo. Para algunas propiedades, la herencia tendría un efecto negativo en la apariencia de una página. Los márgenes, el padding y los bordes (entre otras propiedades) no son heredados por las etiquetas y no es deseable que lo hagan. ¿Por que?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mira el siguiente ejemplo:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; Lorem ipsum &amp;lt;em&amp;gt; dolor &amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; sit amet. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;p {
 padding-left: 20px;
 border-left: solid red;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Observa que la etiqueta &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tienen un borde a la izquierda. Sin embargo, la etiqueta &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; dentro de &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; no tienen ningún borde adicional. Este comportamiento tiene sentido: se vería raro o extraño si hubiera un borde adicional y 20px de espacio a la izquierda de cada etiqueta &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; dentro de un párrafo. Por este motivo es que la propiedad &lt;code&gt;border&lt;/code&gt; no se hereda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#por-que-es-importante-la-herencia"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🤔 ¿Por que es importante la herencia?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aunque esto pueda parecer confuso, la herencia es un gran ahorro de tiempo. Imagina que no se pasan las propiedades CSS a las etiquetas anidadas y que tienes un párrafo &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; que contiene otras etiquetas como una etiqueta &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, una etiqueta &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; para enfatizar el texto y una etiqueta &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; para añadir un enlace. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Si creas un estilo que haga que el texto del párrafo sea blanco y de 32px, sería raro y extraño que todo el texto dentro de las etiquetas &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; y &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tuvieran su estilo normal, tal y como se muestra en la siguiente imagen de muestra:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LXwJQaRr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4rqh4rd5o5o3kf0gfzew.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LXwJQaRr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4rqh4rd5o5o3kf0gfzew.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;En ese caso, tendrías que crear otro estilo para dar formato a la etiqueta &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; y &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; para que coincida con la apariencia de la etiqueta &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Qué tedioso. ¡Por eso esta la herencia y por eso es importante!&lt;/p&gt;

  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you've ever wanted to quickly and accurately get your zoom meeting, or any kind of speech turned into text, then Assembly AI is the API you need. Today I will be covering how to create a simple backend API to handle mp3 file uploads and converting them to PDF files with the transcript included. I will also show sign-in and sign-up functionality as a bonus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-assembly-ai"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Assembly AI?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"AssemblyAI is a top rated API for speech recognition, trusted by startups and global enterprises in production" - Assembly AI Website&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very simple to get started with turning speech to text, and you can do it in just 2 minutes here: &lt;a href="https://docs.assemblyai.com/overview/getting-started"&gt;https://docs.assemblyai.com/overview/getting-started&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get your API key here: &lt;a href="https://app.assemblyai.com/login/"&gt;https://app.assemblyai.com/login/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: You are limited to 3 hours of processing time for the month with this API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#backend-stack"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Backend Stack
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following technologies will be used to build our backend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Node.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Express&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prisma ORM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bcrypt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JWT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pdfkit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#requirements"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Requirements
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will need PostgreSQL in your system. I use this software: &lt;a href="https://postgresapp.com/"&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once PostgreSQL is installed, you will have to create the database and user with the following commands&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ createdb zoom-summarizer
$ createuser -P -s -e zoom_summarizer_user
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, clone my express-prisma-starter to have the same code: &lt;a href="https://github.com/guilleeh/express-prisma-starter"&gt;Code Starter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a .env file inside the repo, and include this so that Prisma knows the database to connect to.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;DATABASE_URL = 'postgresql://zoom-summarizer-user@localhost:5432/zoom-summarizer'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lastly, install the dependencies and run the migration to setup the tables.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ npm i
$ npx prisma migrate dev --name init
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#development"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Development
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want to skip to the point where we use the Assembly AI API, click &lt;a href=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sign-up"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Sign Up
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will start off with the sign up page, where we will collect a name, email and password. Don't worry, we are going to hash the password of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside your source folder, create a new folder called &lt;strong&gt;db&lt;/strong&gt;, with a file called &lt;strong&gt;db.js&lt;/strong&gt;. In here, we will have all database calls. We are doing this to decouple the data layer from the business logic and routes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add create user CRUD in db.js
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PrismaClient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@prisma/client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;prisma&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PrismaClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// CREATE&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createUser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;prisma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add post route for sign up in index.js
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./db/db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;bcrypt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;bcrypt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;jwtService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;jsonwebtoken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`/`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Hello World!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/signup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Email, password and name are required.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// hash password&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;salt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;bcrypt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;genSalt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;SALT_ROUNDS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;passwordHash&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;bcrypt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;salt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// create user&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;passwordHash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;409&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Email account already registered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To test, hit &lt;a href="http://localhost:3001/signup"&gt;http://localhost:3001/signup&lt;/a&gt; with a POST request with the body:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"email"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"memo@memo.com"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"password"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"123"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Guillermo"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And that's it for the sign up endpoint! Pretty straight forward. We use bcrypt to hash the password. If possible though, you should use a more serious solution if you want to take this to production. This was a quick implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sign-in"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Sign In
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we can register users, it's time to log them in. We will be using JWT tokens in order to keep track of sessions. This is not the most secure method(like refresh tokens), but it will do for this tutorial. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're going to create another folder inside src, called &lt;strong&gt;lib&lt;/strong&gt;. Here we are going to put any code dealing with jwt, aws and pdfkit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create the folder lib and the file &lt;strong&gt;jwt.js&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lib/jwt.js
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;jwt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;jsonwebtoken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getJWT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;jwt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sign&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;JWT_SECRET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;expiresIn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;JWT_EXPIRE_TIME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;authorize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// middleware to check if user is logged in&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;token&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;authorization&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;jwt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;verify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;JWT_SECRET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;401&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Authentication failed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getJWT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;authorize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here, getJWT will give us a token for the frontend to store, and authorize is a middleware we will be using in protected routes to make sure a user is logged in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, replace this line on top of the index.js file:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;jwtService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;jsonwebtoken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With this line:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;jwtLib&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./lib/jwt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now we need to get a user by the email they entered, in order to compare passwords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add this function to &lt;strong&gt;db.js&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;db.js&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// READ&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getSingleUserByEmail&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;prisma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;findFirst&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getSingleUserByEmail&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To finish off this sign-in endpoint, we will create a post route for it inside of &lt;strong&gt;index.js&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;index.js&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/signin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Email and password are required.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Find user record&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getSingleUserByEmail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;401&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Authentication failed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// securely compare passwords&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;match&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;bcrypt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;compare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// get jwt&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;jwtToken&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;jwtLib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getJWT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// send jwt and user id to store in local storage&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#upload-amp-audio-processing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Upload &amp;amp; Audio Processing
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we finally get to the part where we use the Assembly AI API in order to get a transcript of our mp3 files!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we will upload our files to S3 so that the Assembly AI API has a place to pull the audio from. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside of &lt;strong&gt;src/lib&lt;/strong&gt;, create a new file called &lt;strong&gt;aws.js&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;aws.js&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;aws-sdk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;s3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;S3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;apiVersion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;2006-03-01&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;uploadFile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;Bucket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;Key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;Body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;stored&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;s3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;upload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;stored&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;uploadFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This code will take care of our s3 file uploads. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we will create the last library file called &lt;strong&gt;pdf.js&lt;/strong&gt; inside lib. Here we will take care of turning the text from the Assembly AI API into a nice pdf format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;pdf.js&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;pdfkit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;generatePdf&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;terms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pdf&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;bufferPages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;buffers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[];&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pdf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;buffers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;bind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;buffers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pdf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pdfData&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Buffer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;buffers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;writeHead&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;pdfData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;generatePdf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The format of the pdf is really up to you, this is a basic paragraph and a list of key terms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also need to store the transcriptId that the AssemblyAI API gives us to later get the transcript text, so we will create db functions for it inside db.js&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;db.js&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createRecording&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;s3Key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;transcriptId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;prisma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;recording&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;s3Key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;transcriptId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getSingleUserById&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;prisma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;findFirst&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="nx"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createRecording&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getSingleUserByEmail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getSingleUserById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we can put this all together to upload an mp3 file, call the Assembly AI API to process that file from S3, and save the transcript Id to later fetch the transcript as a pdf file. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your index.js file should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;index.js&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./db/db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;jwtLib&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./lib/jwt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;awsLib&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./lib/aws&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pdfLib&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./lib/pdf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;node-fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;bcrypt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;bcrypt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fileUpload&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;express-fileupload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;cors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fileUpload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/upload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;jwtLib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;authorize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;There was an error uploading your file.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// get user email&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getSingleUserById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// save transcript id to db&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;recording&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createRecording&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;recording&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;There was an error uploading your file.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notice that we use the authorize middleware for this endpoint and we also need to send the user Id that you get once you log in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All we need now is an endpoint to generate our pdf, which is what we will get to now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's add a db function to get the transcript we saved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;db.js&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getSingleRecording&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;transcriptId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;recording&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;prisma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;recording&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;findFirst&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;transcriptId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;recording&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createRecording&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getSingleUserByEmail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getSingleUserById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getSingleRecording&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And now we can create the endpoint to generate a pdf&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/generate-pdf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;jwtLib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;authorize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;transcriptId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;transcriptId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;You must provide the transcript id.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ASSEMBLYAI_API_URL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;transcriptId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;method&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;authorization&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;content-type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;application/json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;There was an error retrieving your recording.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;auto_highlights_result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;recordingRecord&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getSingleRecording&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;transcriptId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;recordingRecord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pdfLib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;generatePdf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Transcript&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;auto_highlights_result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;There was an error retrieving your recordings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now you just need to provide the endpoint the transcriptId you saved in the database and it will return a pdf file for you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#wrap-up"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Wrap up
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it! You have a basic app that allows users to sign in/up, upload mp3 conversations and get transcripts back in pdf formats. There is tons of room for growth in this project, and if you would like to try it out for yourself, check the links below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source Code: &lt;a href="https://github.com/guilleeh/zoom-summarizer"&gt;https://github.com/guilleeh/zoom-summarizer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Demo: &lt;a href="https://zoom-summarizer.vercel.app/"&gt;https://zoom-summarizer.vercel.app/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The source code is a full stack application, so you can see how I put this all together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you all learned something today!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you are working on a small project or especially big projects with multiple team members then you need to follow proper coding standards in order to maintain the code stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laravel follows the PSR-2 coding standard and the PSR-4 autoloading standard. To maintain the same coding standard like PSR-2 for your project(s) there are multiple packages available that can help you fix your code to follow standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article we will use &lt;a href="https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer"&gt;PHP Coding Standards Fixer&lt;/a&gt; to setup it on a Laravel project level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following are the steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-1"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step # 1
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to your project root folder and run the following command:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;composer require friendsofphp/php-cs-fixer &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--dev&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-2"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step # 2
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your project root, create a new file named &lt;code&gt;.php-cs-fixer.php&lt;/code&gt; and add the following code and then save it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;PhpCsFixer\Config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;PhpCsFixer\Finder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$rules&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'array_syntax'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'syntax'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'short'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'binary_operator_spaces'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'default'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'single_space'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'operators'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'=&amp;gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'blank_line_after_namespace'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'blank_line_after_opening_tag'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'blank_line_before_statement'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'statements'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'return'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'braces'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'cast_spaces'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'class_attributes_separation'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'elements'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'method'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'one'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'class_definition'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'concat_space'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'spacing'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'one'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'declare_equal_normalize'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'elseif'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'*.php'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;notName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'*.blade.php'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;ignoreVCS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$config&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;setFinder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$finder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;setRules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$rules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;setRiskyAllowed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;setUsingCache&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This file contains local configuration that will be used instead of project configurations. It will let you configure rules, the files and directories that need to be analysed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to change the above file to suit your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-3"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step # 3
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open &lt;code&gt;composer.json&lt;/code&gt; file and add the following lines to the script section:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"sniff"&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"./vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix -vvv --dry-run --show-progress=dots"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"lint"&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"./vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix -vvv --show-progress=dots"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With this we have added two scripts that we can run with composer command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;composer sniff&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This command is used for dry run in order to show you all the files that needs to be fixed without fixing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;composer lint&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This command will try to auto fix your code and will show you the summary at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following are the some useful links:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer"&gt;PHP-CS-Fixer Package&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/blob/3.0/doc/usage.rst"&gt;PHP-CS-Fixer Documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Yup&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;yup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;FormikStepper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;FormikStep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;InputField&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;formik-stepper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
