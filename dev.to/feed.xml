  &lt;a href="#iot-primer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  IoT Primer
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internet landscape is continuously evolving, and with the introduction of faster networks such as 5G, virtually everything will be connected. This capability of more rapid, low latency internet access will spur innovation and create previously unforeseen devices. Hence, the term IoT is often broached up when talking about the future of internet connectivity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Internet of Things — IoT, for short — is made up of devices that connect to the internet and share data with each other. Any device or object that is equipped with a  Wi-Fi chip that connects to the internet and shares/receives information is an IoT device. For instance, voice-activated speakers, thermostats or motion-sensing Wi-FI routers. All of them are examples of IoT devices. While connecting to the internet is the only requirement, actual value comes from the communication to a back-end service that can perform computations, mutations, aggregations, and all that fancy jazz!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#limitations-of-iot-communication-over-http"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Limitations of IoT Communication over HTTP
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communication between the devices becomes a critical aspect of the IoT infrastructure. The underlying communication protocol needs to be fast, secure, reliable and scalable enough to support mass-produced devices and simultaneously provide value. Most developers are familiar with the HTTP protocol used in web services, so why not connect IoT devices with HTTP-supported web services and call it a day? Depending on the type of use case, you can, but it only works for a small subset of cases. There are several limitations when using HTTP with IoT infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HTTP is one-way communication&lt;/strong&gt; - All requests are initiated by the client, and the server responds with a response. IoT devices act as a client and hence can only create requests but cannot receive any commands passively to perform an action. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HTTP is a synchronous protocol&lt;/strong&gt; - All web browsers wait for the server to respond to a particular request, whereas this may not be the case for IoT devices. For instance, a group of sensors posting data in a high latent/unreliable network, synchronous communication may be problematic or even detrimental where precision calculations are fundamental. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HTTP is intrinsically optimized for one-to-one communication&lt;/strong&gt; - The client makes a request, and the server responds. When a collection of IoT devices are working together, it might make sense to broadcast a response to a group of devices which is inherently complicated to achieve with HTTP protocol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HTTP is document-centric&lt;/strong&gt; - HTTP is optimized to share documents, meaning message sizes are much larger and need to be parsed, evaluated, etc. Thus this creates bottlenecks for already resource-constrained devices such as sensors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the above reasons, HTTP can not provide a suitable ecosystem for several IoT use cases. Thus, an alternative that overcomes these obstacles is MQTT. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-mqtt"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is MQTT
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MQTT stands for Message Queue Telemetry Transport is built on top TCP/IP stack, initially tailored towards facilitating communication between sensors and oil pipelines. It became an OASIS standard messaging protocol for IoT devices in 2014. However, its name has nothing to do with messaging queues and is actually based on Publish-Subscribe or pub-sub model. It has minimal overhead and is designed for reliable communication over unreliable connectivity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#key-characteristics-of-mqtt"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Key Characteristics of MQTT
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Binary Responses&lt;/strong&gt; - MQTT is a binary-based protocol; the control element, unlike HTTP, is bytes. Text-based protocols are not suitable for machines as all machines operate via binary data manipulation. The smallest possible response over MQTT is 2 bytes, whereas the minimum possible response is 17 bytes over HTTP. Therefore, MQTT is lightweight and super-efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bi-Directional Communication&lt;/strong&gt; - MQTT allows messaging between the device to cloud and cloud to the device. Thus, enabling message broadcasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Agnostic&lt;/strong&gt; - The transport of payload itself is agnostic to the content of payload, hence it is possible to send a payload of all imaginable data types (even custom data types).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Built on top TCP/IP&lt;/strong&gt; - This provides necessary benefits of using TCP such as packet reliability, persistence etc. Furthermore, MQTT can also run SSL/TLS, ensuring the data communication is encrypted and secure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above-listed benefits are vital in supporting IoT devices while providing necessary scalability. However, the actual benefits stem from the publish-subscribe architecture embodied by the MQTT protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#publishsubscribe-model"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Publish-Subscribe Model
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a traditional server-client architecture, the client communicates to a server, and the server responds back with a response. In contrast to the conventional view, client-server entities are decoupled into two entities in the pub-sub model, &lt;strong&gt;broker&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;clients&lt;/strong&gt;. There are two types of clients, a &lt;strong&gt;publisher&lt;/strong&gt;, a client that sends messages and a &lt;strong&gt;subscriber&lt;/strong&gt;, which receives messages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the broker, as the name suggests, is to facilitate message passing between the clients. All messaging in the MQTT broker is distributed based on topics. A subscriber client subscribes to particular topics, and similarly, a Publisher client publishes a message and topic to the broker. The broker then, based on the topic, forwards the messages to appropriate clients. This decoupling provides numerous benefits over traditional client-server architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each client does not need to know every other client's existence. To receive or publish messages, the client only needs to know the broker's host IP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each client does not need to run simultaneously. Brokers can store messages and enable the creation of new topics on the fly. Hence, clients go through their cycle of receiving and sending notifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each client can work asynchronously to send and receive messages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;The best way to learn a new programming language is to build projects.

I have created a list of 40 beginner friendly project tutorials in Vanilla JavaScript, React, and TypeScript.

My advice for tutorials would be to watch the video, build the project, break it apart and rebuild it your own way. Experiment with adding new features or using different methods.

That will test if you have really learned the concepts or not.

You can click on any of the projects listed below to jump to that section of the article.

      <title>Bases de datos y ORM</title>
      <author>Pablo Agustín Canale</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 02:53:29 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/pablocanale/bases-de-datos-y-orm-3d5m</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/pablocanale/bases-de-datos-y-orm-3d5m</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;La base de datos es una recopilación de datos e información de forma organizada y estructurada.&lt;br&gt;
Normalmente cuentan con un sistema de gestión de base de datos (DBMS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#bases-de-datos-relacionales"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  BASES DE DATOS RELACIONALES
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Es el modelo más utilizado hoy en día.&lt;br&gt;
En esencia las bases de datos relacionales son un conjunto de tablas formadas por columnas (campos) y filas (registros). La estructura nos ayuda a hacer &lt;strong&gt;relaciones&lt;/strong&gt; entre tablas mediante &lt;strong&gt;claves foráneas&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;¿QUÉ ES UN DBMS?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Es un programa que te permite crear, editar y administrar las bases de datos. La mayoria de las relacionales utilizan SQL, como MySQL o PostgreSQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;¿QUÉ ES SQL?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Es un lenguaje de programación usado por casi todas las bases de datos relacionales para consultar, definir y manipular datos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRINCIPIOS ACID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--H1Ar2Gcs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kfa3addre1obkoiatdmj.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--H1Ar2Gcs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kfa3addre1obkoiatdmj.png" alt="Image description" width="386" height="491"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#object-relational-mapping-orm"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  OBJECT RELATIONAL MAPPING (ORM)
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Es un modelo de programación que consiste en la transformación de las tablas de una base de datos, en una serie de entidades que simplifiquen las tareas básicas de acceso a los datos para el programador. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¿Porqué queremos un ORM?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Como sabemos SQL es el lenguaje más utilazado de consulta pero existen varios sistemas de gestión de base de datos que cuentan con diferencias en los mismos tipos de consultas, por ejemplo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EFo_-GFR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ijdhmv8idums8b0exjue.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EFo_-GFR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ijdhmv8idums8b0exjue.png" alt="Image description" width="429" height="72"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esto nos lleva a dificultades en el desarrollo ya que deberiamos aprendernos estas variaciones para cada base de datos distinta en la que trabajemos, y mas importante aún, si en un futuro deseamos migrar la aplicación, habría que reescribir una gran cantidad de consultas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Con el ORM nos facilitamos el trabajo, nos brinda ayuda en las labores básicas de cualquier acceso a datos, el CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Realizando todas estas labores a través de un lenguaje orientado a objetos.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>6 Myths Keeping You From Becoming a Software Engineer</title>
      <author>Jordan Smith</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 02:51:06 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/jordan_smith/6-myths-keeping-you-from-becoming-a-software-engineer-4gf5</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/jordan_smith/6-myths-keeping-you-from-becoming-a-software-engineer-4gf5</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you're thinking about trying to start a career as a software developer and done any kind of research into the tech industry, you've no doubt come across the countless horror stories and discouraging "facts" about how difficult it is to break into the world of software engineering. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone that started out my tech journey with a background in warehouses and manufacturing, with no extraordinary technical acumen, no connections to the tech community, and no college under my belt (except for a couple failed classes in the "running-start" program) - I'm here to tell you that much of what you hear is simply not true. Although it does take work, and you won't just get a coding job on a whim, there really aren't as many barriers separating you and your dream career as you might think. The world of technology is constantly evolving, and so are the requirements to working in it. While some of these myths may have been true at some point in the past, they aren't now. It's time to stop letting them get out into the world and start getting rid of this artificial barrier that's stopping so many people from even attempting to get the career they want. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#myth-1-you-have-to-be-a-tech-junkie-to-be-a-good-developer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Myth #1: You have to be a tech junkie to be a good developer
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is this idea that all developers are some kind of "tech nerds" that grew up taking apart computers and hacking video games. But as seems to always be the case, reality isn't quite like the stereotypes lead you to believe. You don't have to be a major technology enthusiast to be a software engineer. I was never all that into tech outside of being a general consumer. Sure I played video games and was excited when the new iPod or new phone came out, but the thought of actually finding out how these things worked was far from my mind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All you really need is a general understanding and a willingness to learn about the technology relevant to the field you want to work in. If you are a tech junkie... great! You already know you'll enjoy the work! But don't be discouraged if you're not. There's a good chance you'll find yourself getting more into it as your career grows and as you start working on new and exciting things. If you're reading this article and you've gotten this far - you have more than enough interest to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#myth-2-you-have-to-be-a-genius-to-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Myth #2: You have to be a genius to code
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is similar to the first myth (and several more later on) in that it's just another stereotype. I can't tell you how many interactions I've had that went pretty much exactly like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me after someone asks what I do: "I'm a software developer, so I make apps and websites and things like that."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Them: "Wow you must be really smart. I could never do something like that."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as that conversation is fine if you want to stroke your ego a bit, I always feel a little awkward afterwards. Because of course I'm not any smarter than the person I'm talking to. I just happened to learn a different set of skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning to code is sort of like learning another language. It takes dedication, incremental learning (start small and easy then slowly move to more difficult and complex), repetition, and of course practice. But the important thing to know is it doesn't require any inherit &lt;em&gt;"smarts."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#myth-3-programming-involves-too-much-complex-math"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Myth #3: Programming involves too much complex math
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was something that I believed before getting started, and something that almost made me change my course entirely. But thankfully I kept going, and to my immense relief, learned that programming doesn't have to involve some crazy math skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now to caveat this - I recognize that a lot of degree programs and universities do require higher level math, however not all of them do. And as I'll talk about a bit later, traditional college isn't your only option. I also have to acknowledge that some programming actually does involve a good amount of more complex math. If you are looking to get into something like game development or cryptography or some other more niche fields, then this one won't be as much of a myth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you're someone like me who dreaded walking into math class, not all hope is lost! There are plenty of fields that you can get into that don't require some kind of advanced trigo-calcu-algebraic madness. Things like building websites, creating user interfaces, or even a lot of API and cloud work, are all perfectly valid and lucrative areas of focus for a programmer and require little to no high level math skills. Besides, unless you're in an interview (and sometimes not even then), no one is going to frown on you pulling up Google when the occasional need for math does arise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take it from me. I have been coding professionally for a little over 4 years, I make a comfortable 6-figure salary, and have no issues completing any tasks or growing in any of the companies I've worked for, and I can't remember a time I had to solve a complex math problem all on my own to get the job done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#myth-4-you-need-to-have-an-expensive-college-degree"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Myth #4: You need to have an expensive college degree
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of those myths that started as a fact. Back in the day if you wanted to become a programmer the best option was to go get a degree at some university and inevitably go into a bunch of debt. Fortunately though this thought process is starting to disappear. With technology becoming such an integral part of every day life, and with so much easy access to self-learning materials, more and more paths are opening up to get into the tech world. It's starting to become more common to meet developers that are entirely self taught. Utilizing online resources such as LinkedIn Learning, Udemy, Codecademy, or even just through YouTube tutorials - you can learn everything you need to know to nail an interview and be a very proficient engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if you want a little more guidance than that, but still don't want to go majorly in debt for a large university degree? Well, there's options for you too! Bootcamps are shorter programs that solely focus on getting someone the skills to become a software developer without all the fluff of a full scale degree. You won't be leaving these bootcamps with a Bachelor's degree, but you will be leaving with the skills you need to start doing the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's also more programs that are coming up at smaller schools and community colleges that do end with a Bachelor's degree, but at a fraction of the cost of a large university. This is the route I took. My local community college offered a program in &lt;em&gt;"Applied Computer Science"&lt;/em&gt; where we spent two years in small cohorts of students, creating real applications for real clients. All in the process of learning to code. The small and consistent class sizes along with having a core group of a few teachers allowed us to build strong relationships that in turn lead to greater learning. Building real apps for real clients, allowed us to really dive deep into the practical application of programming, rather than just getting taught a bunch of computer science theory. It was at this school that I also achieved my Certified Scrum Master certificate, and even worked in my first web development internship. And the best part is - my entire Bachelor's degree ended up costing less than a quarter of what it would have at my local large university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look into less traditional methods of learning. You may be surprised at what's out there today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#myth-5-coding-is-a-young-persons-game"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Myth #5: Coding is a young person's game
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to preface this by saying that unfortunately agism does exist in the tech world today. It shouldn't exist and it's nothing but a detriment to the entire tech society. But that is another topic for another post. My point here is that even if you don't think of yourself as "young," you shouldn't count yourself out of becoming an engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I were to guess at what started this whole idea that the older generation can't become developers, I would attribute it to the early days of the big tech boom. When computers started to be commonplace, everyone started carrying tiny computers in their pockets, and the internet was just hitting its stride. At this time the people that were growing up alongside the technology were able to see it as a natural part of life, while at the same time the older generation saw the tech as something new and wildly different than what they were used to. But times have changed. Technology is so prevalent today that it's almost unavoidable to people of any age. This means more exposure, which consequently "levels the playing field" and makes it a lot easier for the older generation to quickly ramp up their skills in technology. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, anyone of any age can get into software development and be just as successful as the 20-something year olds just out of college. I myself didn't even start learning until I had been out of High School for around 8 years and I didn't get my first internship until close to 30 years old - which admittedly isn't &lt;em&gt;old&lt;/em&gt;, but it's definitely not the traditional path. I've also worked with plenty of engineers that are twice my age or more, and many of them make me look like someone who just wrote my first "Hello World" program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Age is nothing but a number. Whether you're a fresh graduate not even out of teenage years, or you're looking to switch careers after 30+ years in another industry, you can become a software engineer if that's where you want to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#myth-6-programmers-are-introverts-that-spend-all-day-in-the-darkness-staring-at-a-screen"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Myth #6: Programmers are introverts that spend all day in the darkness staring at a screen
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay. So this one definitely could be true for some. If you like to be in a dark room while you work and coding is your passion so you spend all day and night doing it, then you do you! But my point here is that this isn't the way it has to be. It's not like you get your first programming job and are suddenly teleported to a dungeon where you can never leave or talk to anyone else. I've actually found that this job can be quite social! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot (almost all) of software development in the professional world involves teamwork in some capacity. Whether it's virtual meetings or working together in person, you will be collaborating with others to get your work done. There's also a good chance you will be interacting with people who aren't developers. A lot of teams will also consist of designers, project managers, sales, and even sometimes clients or stakeholders, so you may be interacting with a lot of different groups of people. Additionally, if you're particularly extroverted, you may find yourself joining the many developers today that go to conferences, teach classes, host podcasts, or in general spend a lot of their time being around others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's also a lot of networking. Networking with others can become vital to a software engineer's career, especially in the early days. Whether that means just having a presence on LinkedIn, or going to meetups and workshops and exchanging information with the people you meet, networking can open up tons of new job opportunities. Think about it. If you're a hiring manager or a recruiter looking for a new Front End dev to join your team, and you recently had a great conversation with someone about how JavaScript really isn't &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; that bad, you're probably going to reach out to that person first to see if they are interested! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you don't have to be secluded in a corner to be a developer. In fact, it helps if you can manage to have a little bit of a social side to you! That's not to say you can't be a developer as an introvert either. As a fellow shy-guy I can confirm that it's possible. But if you can manage to put yourself out there to meet and talk to people every once in a while, and if you can collaborate well with your team, you'll find a lot of success in this career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#wrapping-it-up"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Wrapping it up
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post ended up a lot longer than I originally intended, and if you've stuck around until now thank you! My goal with this long-winded list is to prove that anyone can start a career in software development if they really want to. We as a community in the tech world need to put a stop to the gatekeeping and bring down the intimidation factor so that more people can discover what a great career this can be. If you're considering jumping in, give it a shot. And if you have any other things stopping you from getting started that I haven't covered here, give me a shout. I'd be happy to give you some insight from the inside... and most likely end up telling you to try it anyway!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Developers' Collaborative Playlist</title>

      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-workflow"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My Workflow
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-inspired-me"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What inspired me?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spend most of my free time with coding and I need fairy of inspiration during these times of intense thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focusing on the same issue for a long time can be very tiring sometimes. Especially if the target problem doesn't have a single solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time I feel burnout, I want to take my mind on different adventures. And often the easiest way to start such an adventure is with a 'Shuffle Play' button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lYpa9l5H--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media4.giphy.com/media/lJEGgG5ajs4zC/giphy.gif%3Fcid%3Decf05e47xi4jrxg1pzq9g0ta4txnrhvf0rh0vxtj2rypwwep%26rid%3Dgiphy.gif%26ct%3Dg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lYpa9l5H--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media4.giphy.com/media/lJEGgG5ajs4zC/giphy.gif%3Fcid%3Decf05e47xi4jrxg1pzq9g0ta4txnrhvf0rh0vxtj2rypwwep%26rid%3Dgiphy.gif%26ct%3Dg" alt="need_vacation" width="480" height="270"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same algorithm can be written differently by each developer. The developer's code style becomes their signature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the question in my mind was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coding is an art, so what do artists listen to while performing this art?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6lGWfO8X--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media0.giphy.com/media/RbDKaczqWovIugyJmW/giphy.gif%3Fcid%3D790b76117fcb52c86762d981a8ef2cfa4b396358982ef5fe%26rid%3Dgiphy.gif%26ct%3Dg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6lGWfO8X--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media0.giphy.com/media/RbDKaczqWovIugyJmW/giphy.gif%3Fcid%3D790b76117fcb52c86762d981a8ef2cfa4b396358982ef5fe%26rid%3Dgiphy.gif%26ct%3Dg" alt="code_n_music" width="480" height="270"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought it might be a pretty fun and elegant way to answer: creating a &lt;a href="https://github.com/oz9un/Developers-Playlist"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;developers' collaborative playlist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, all automated using &lt;strong&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-i-created-the-workflow"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How I created the workflow?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I could, I would like to automate everything in this life. I may never be able to automate dealing with people, but this project has been a good medicine for my automatization addiction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NAzAIR2---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media1.giphy.com/media/f5YrGliGs8sn0Mjh2e/giphy.gif%3Fcid%3Decf05e47f2eqvvemztoilqpjj3d36olw0ja4t0nq34km1r7n%26rid%3Dgiphy.gif%26ct%3Dg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NAzAIR2---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media1.giphy.com/media/f5YrGliGs8sn0Mjh2e/giphy.gif%3Fcid%3Decf05e47f2eqvvemztoilqpjj3d36olw0ja4t0nq34km1r7n%26rid%3Dgiphy.gif%26ct%3Dg" alt="addiction" width="480" height="270"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I had to overcome some problems before reaching my final goal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communication with &lt;a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/"&gt;Spotify API&lt;/a&gt;, refreshing OAuth tokens, searching for songs and adding a track to the target playlist...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evaluating the issues opened by the users and returning an appropriate result. Answering and closing issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To make things a little wackier, picking random gifs from various categories and using them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The name of the developer who opened the issue and their favorite song should be stored as a contributor and written in the README. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;




&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#solution-workflow-for-problem-1-dealing-with-spotify-api"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Solution workflow for problem 1: dealing with Spotify API
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's be honest, Spotify has pretty good API documentation. But things can get complicated as you get involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn't want to have a lot of code in this repository I created for GitHub Actions Hackathon and make the situation even more complicated. For this reason, I created a different &lt;a href="https://github.com/oz9un/Spotify-API-Apps"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;public repository&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and kept all the tools I wrote to communicate with the Spotify API in there. Thus, I would be able to effectively use GitHub actions' ability to communicate with a different repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My two different repository will communicate like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jj_qexJ2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media3.giphy.com/media/WySK0nQiJKLy25HLhp/giphy.gif%3Fcid%3Decf05e474utlbpznzvyxlspp0cklmizc9q8fbn7srlcdj29s%26rid%3Dgiphy.gif%26ct%3Dg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jj_qexJ2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media3.giphy.com/media/WySK0nQiJKLy25HLhp/giphy.gif%3Fcid%3Decf05e474utlbpznzvyxlspp0cklmizc9q8fbn7srlcdj29s%26rid%3Dgiphy.gif%26ct%3Dg" alt="communicate" width="480" height="270"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The constantly talking kid on the left would represent the repository where I used GitHub Actions and submitted for this Hackathon, while the kid on the right that would just listen and execute the commands would represent the repository where I kept my auxiliary Spotify API functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, the string itself would of course be &lt;strong&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#solution-workflow-for-problem-2-issues-issues"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Solution workflow for problem 2: issues, issues...
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order for the developers to make a song request, they should open an issue with the title 'song request' and the body of the issue should have a text in - format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IfnmPvfn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fd4t9qfu81o3ozqwtokb.GIF" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IfnmPvfn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fd4t9qfu81o3ozqwtokb.GIF" alt="song_request" width="800" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, it was necessary to correctly evaluate the issues opened by the users and to produce the necessary actions accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this process, I explored the unlimited features of GitHub Actions and had to use many features from if-checks to environment variables. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#solution-workflow-for-problem-3-random-wacky-gifs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Solution workflow for problem 3: random wacky gifs
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generating random gifs was very useful in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Responses to issues opened by developers would be more fun and varied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There couldn't have been a better opportunity for me to learn about environment variables and cross-jobs data sharing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore I did it. do i regret it? No. Was that wacky? Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nVMqh6w2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media1.giphy.com/media/p4yyZS2G7tlA2tr5X0/giphy.gif%3Fcid%3Decf05e478jscdosip452h60vl0hyqtqtpj9jh96ry0sh4t6w%26rid%3Dgiphy.gif%26ct%3Dg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nVMqh6w2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media1.giphy.com/media/p4yyZS2G7tlA2tr5X0/giphy.gif%3Fcid%3Decf05e478jscdosip452h60vl0hyqtqtpj9jh96ry0sh4t6w%26rid%3Dgiphy.gif%26ct%3Dg" alt="wacky" width="480" height="480"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#solution-workflow-for-problem-4-contributors"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Solution workflow for problem 4: contributors
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a good idea to view the songs added by each user. Until you try to code it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GitHub Actions does not keep any persistent data by nature. So I had to overcome this nature and keep contributors' information:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LMsvPnP9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h0dif02ymzkoz8xx2obd.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LMsvPnP9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h0dif02ymzkoz8xx2obd.png" alt="contributions" width="550" height="301"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created files for every single contributor. Each time a new song was added, these files and the README_template would be concatenated and a new README file would be created. At this point, I used the code push feature to the target repository, which is readily available in the GitHub Actions marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Frankly, without &lt;strong&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/strong&gt;, this project would not have been easy to realize and popularize among developers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this process, I also had the opportunity to explore and use many ready-made works in the GitHub Actions market:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;actions/checkout@v2 💖&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;actions/download-artifact@v1 💖&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;actions/github-script@v5 💖&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;peter-evans/close-issue@v1 💖&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;actions/upload-artifact@v1 💖&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;actions/setup-python@v2 💖&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ad-m/github-push-action@master 💖&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Description🤖:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same algorithm can be written differently by each developer. The developer's code style becomes their signature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coding is an art, so what do artists listen to while performing this art?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Developer's Playlist&lt;/strong&gt; analyzes opened issues on this repository using &lt;strong&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/strong&gt; and collects developers' favorite songs into a collaborative playlist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Usage📖:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open an issue with title &lt;strong&gt;'song request'&lt;/strong&gt;

      <title>1000 days to £1million - this should be fun!</title>
      <author>InHuOfficial</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 23:19:54 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/inhuofficial/1000-days-to-ps1million-this-should-be-fun-2d4e</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/inhuofficial/1000-days-to-ps1million-this-should-be-fun-2d4e</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;1000 days from now Inclusivity Hub will turnover £1million!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hearing that without any context I would guess that you probably have questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions such as "what is Inclusivity Hub?", "why should I care?", "what are you doing in my bathroom?", those sort of common everyday questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well I will try and answer those questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a long article (I am introducing the next 1000 days of my life so there is a fair bit to say!) and I don't expect too many people to read it in it's entirety, but if you do I am sure you will find at least a few interesting things that will make you want to follow me for the ride! (Actually I don't expect many people to read it at all as it will be a #watercooler post and we know those don't get much visibility 🤣)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And don't worry, &lt;strong&gt;most&lt;/strong&gt; of the posts that follow on from this one will be shorter and more focused! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, let me explain what I am doing and why as I think it is going to be interesting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-little-preamble-to-set-the-scene"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A little preamble to set the scene
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have spent the last 18-24 months building a database all around accessibility and disability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I was taking stock of the project and I realised that I will never complete the database (to a stage where I can release the product associated with it) on my own. It needs money and time and I am certainly not in a position to go looking for investment to complete it as I would have to give up far too much of the company at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a few weeks ago I reassessed the direction I was taking. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why was I building this database in the first place? (to improve accessibility) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can I produce a product or service more quickly that could generate the revenue required to pay for staff and researchers to complete this product? (as I still want to build it at some point as it could really be a game changer)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything that follows is a result of that reassessment and I really do hope you find it interesting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#completely-starting-over"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Completely starting over!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won't say that the last 18-24 months have been completely wasted as I still have the work done on the database so far, but they haven't been productive months overall and have cost me a small fortune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in essence I am back at square one! Zero turnover other than a few long standing clients and next to zero capital to work with (as  I burned through most of my savings in order to work less so I could build the database!) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that realisation really did hurt (a lot) a few weeks back. It kind of still stings now to be honest as I have a lot of passion for that project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in reality, here I am, nearly 2 years of "wasted" effort, a load of money "wasted" and having to start from scratch with nothing but the knowledge in my head and some good contacts to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all that (and after licking my wounds) I realised, this is actually where the fun starts! Other people have built epic stuff from this position, I just needed to work out how to emulate them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some thought I decided to run an experiment, a mega experiment at that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would it take to go from "zero to hero" in less than 3 years?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have built some decent "lifestyle" businesses, but what about building a big business, a business that could be a behemoth in 5 or 10 years time, a world changer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, the sort of trajectory a lot of us would like to take but never quite find the gumption to give it a go or believe we can achieve?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now there are a lot of steps between the zero to hero random thought and this article, but it all boils down to falling in love with the idea of 1000 days to £1million as an interesting goal and being able to take the first step with this article. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I didn't stop there. Oh no!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent ages trying to work out how I could work the changes in my personal life that would be required to achieve this into the equation too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially this is a 1000 day experiment where I cut out the stuff that isn't productive, optimise the things I &lt;strong&gt;have&lt;/strong&gt; to do, and channel the extra time and energy into building something awesome, all while "bearing my soul" to the public! Eek!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or to put it another way, this is a 1000 day study with 1 participant on how systemising your life and planning more than a few weeks ahead can change your trajectory (or completely fail, who knows, that is the point of the experiment!) and turn you (me) into a super human!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sound-exciting-you-dont-know-the-half-of-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Sound exciting? You don't know the half of it.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been a busy boy over the last 8 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of days of feeling sorry for myself first of all, followed by a couple of days of frustration and then I was in a place to pick myself up and start reassessing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grabbed my focused writing software (it is called Cold Turkey Writer), set it to 4000 words minimum and just wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is known as free writing (writing without purpose and without editing or even worrying if what you write makes any sense) and I find it really useful to help access thoughts that are buried deep in my subconscious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spewed my anger and frustration onto the page, my darkest thoughts about myself and the world laid out in front of me (you know, the "I failed", "I wasted a load of time", "I wish I had been born with a small fortune" sort of harmful crap we tell ourselves while sat in our nice and warm houses surrounded by nice things, completely unaware of how lucky we are).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was about 1500 words into this tirade of self pity when suddenly the following sentence dropped onto the page (out of context it might look weird but I was ranting to myself about wasting time on menial tasks!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I wish I had spent more time systemising things today to save time tomorrow."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, it is almost poetic! Are you crying at the beauty of my musings? No? Well how rude!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, being serious for a second, that one sentence switched my brain into a different gear. It is one of the reasons I love freewriting and should do it more often. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systemisation is what my brain likes to do! Look at a process and find a way to systemise it is fun to me! Taking a long look at the opportunity cost of doing something (spending 20 hours systemising a process) vs the reward (an hour saved a week) and whether it is worth investing the time (absolutely).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fell down a bit of a rabbit hole of idea generation and thought. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 hours later (and a total of 6500 words) I had the outline of the most ambitious plan I have ever conceived. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was going to invest the time into long term gains even if it means short term pain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was the crux of it, a mentality of "focus on next year instead of the next week or next month".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that point I went to bed, it was late!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day I was full of nervous energy. The voice in the back of my head was going "don't be silly, this will never work", but a louder voice was going "yeah, but just imagine if it did, nothing on that list is impossible, far from it, it is just difficult and will require some serious discipline".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say I am here and writing this article so the good voice won! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#enough-preamble-what-the-hell-are-you-on-about"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Enough preamble, what the hell are you on about!
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok Ok, I know that was a lot of build up, but honestly you needed to know the context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going to build...A Content Management System (CMS)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;boo, hiss, I waited for that!? are you kidding me!&lt;/strong&gt; I hear you say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just hang on, there is a hell of a lot more to this I promise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn't a story about building a CMS, this is a story of thinking in systems. This is a story of how to turn yourself into one of those 10x people who seem to be able to do everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going to be sharing a lot more than just the journey of building and launching a CMS (I am twitching every time I say that, I promise I have some interesting ideas that will make it stand out so hang in there a little bit longer and I will explain and justify undertaking something that I would normally say you should avoid!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going to be sharing some of the systems I put in place to save time, the tools I build to help manage my time, optimise my workout regime, eat well, manage content creation, marketing, business planning and more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially by the end of this experiment I am hoping I will not only have built an awesome product that is successful, but also built a step by step idiots guide and roadmap to doing the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People don't seem to have done this before as far as I can tell (or maybe people have tried and failed and so we never heard about it 😱). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of guides on how to build a business, there are loads of guides on how to manage your time, there are loads of guides on marketing and branding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they are always treated as separate entities and to me that is just not helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no way you can grow a mega business and not have your personal life sorted, know how to market (or find someone good at it) etc. They are all things that are heavily connected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here is the thing, many people sacrifice their personal life for a business. I know, I have done it before and it &lt;strong&gt;sucks&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So while I am not going to pretend I am not going to work more hours than most people, there will also be balance there and I will be sharing how to &lt;strong&gt;make time&lt;/strong&gt; for friends and family without going off track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ok-it-all-still-sounds-a-little-bit-vague-can-you-let-me-know-exactly-what-to-expect"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Ok it all still sounds a little bit vague, can you let me know exactly what to expect?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure thing, I am glad you asked!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I have split the next 1000 days into 5 sections, think of them as sprints! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal of these thousand days is to build a company from zero to £1million turnover with a small budget and while having to support myself and my family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#section-1-optimising"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Section 1: Optimising
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first section is "optimising", where I will be sharing little bits of software I build and systems I have developed to help manage my personal life, personal goals and time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#section-2-ramp-up"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Section 2: Ramp Up
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second section is "ramp up" where I will be building some mini applications that are related to the CMS. These will be built in such a way that they can be sold as stand alone products but later integrate them into the main product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#section-3-launch"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Section 3: Launch
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third section is "launch" in which I will be combining some of the products I have built into an Minimal Viable Product (MVP) for the CMS (nearly there if you are hanging on to see what will make  the CMS so special).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#section-4-get-funding"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Section 4: Get Funding
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth section is "get funding" where I will share the journey of taking a MVP with a (hopefully) reasonable userbase and a decent social media following out for investment and what the pitching process is like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#section-5-grow-fast"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Section 5: Grow Fast
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the final 5th section is "grow fast" where I will hopefully have secured funding and how to invest that money for growth (without being one of those silicon valley companies that think that loss making in exchange for users with no monetisation plan is in any way a good idea, profitable from day 1 is the concept here!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully that sounds interesting, but there is even more to this experiment!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#more-than-just-a-business-startup-follow-along"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  More than just a business start-up follow along?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh you bet, I told you it was ambitious!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Firstly&lt;/strong&gt; I am going to be sharing my progress with you and that takes time, so it has to be worth it for me as well as you! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can think of it like a public diary (with some filtering of course) so you can see what is working and how often I fail and the mistakes I make! (There will be plenty of them I assure you!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wherever appropriate I will by writing guides on how &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; did things in the hope that they are useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you will get value from my wins and loses and I will get value as people will become interested in the journey I am taking (and if I do everything correctly build a decent following for Inclusivity Hub (InHu)).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secondly&lt;/strong&gt; I am going to slowly reveal how each part of the puzzle leads to the next as some decisions may look strange out of context. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why would I spend the time building XXX when I could just use service YYY, what does it lead to and what are the benefits? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the personal life bit coincide with the business bit. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you write a load of content and it help grow the business following pre and post launch while being entertaining and not (overly) self promoting all the time? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly there is just too much to share in one go, but trust me I have planned a path through all this that means that no effort is wasted and everything has more than one purpose!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that (in my opinion) is the key to 10x performance. As often as possible make sure that what you are doing contributes towards two goals and repurpose things as often as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Live by the rule "We have limited time, use it wisely and efficiently."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ok-i-still-dont-get-it-but-it-certainly-sounds-exciting"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  OK, I still don't get it, but it certainly sounds exciting!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exactly, and you are too kind for saying so!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it isn't 100% clear as it is a big and complex beast with a lot of moving parts and I am trying to condense 8 weeks worth of planning into a single post. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me summarise what &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; will get out of following me on this journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A look into my mind and how I approach things - my mind is a scary place though, so you have been warned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A set of rules and systems to help you optimise your own life, pick and choose the bits that work for you or follow every single one of them, it is up to you!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constant feedback on what works and what doesn't from someone who is "new" to a lot of things. (You would be surprised at the breadth of knowledge I have on some topics compared to how little of that knowledge I implement in my daily life! 🤣 Applying principles rather than just learning them is an entirely different kettle of fish!) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A journey that will either end in success, "meh" results, or complete failure! No matter what it should be something you can learn from!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Probably a load of free tools as I prototype the proof of concepts for things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A journey of building a business from scratch through to launch that is designed to scale, explained warts and all!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launching and growing a game changing CMS (yes, I am finally going to explain the end product!) and the struggles and hard spots on getting traction!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-cms"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The CMS
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is what you came here for then sorry if you had to read all that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can imagine you are wondering why on Earth someone would build &lt;strong&gt;another&lt;/strong&gt; CMS in such a crowded market, with so many big players with mega budgets to try and compete against!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well let me tell you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#accessibility"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Accessibility
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing is that the whole thing will be built "Accessibility First" rather than trying to make something accessible after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be the main feature / selling point as few CMS systems are built this way (can you name one?). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that the editor will be built so that it is usable with Screen Readers, Magnification Software, alternative input devices etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will also have options to change colours, fonts, layouts and more to meet the needs of an individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A truly accessible CMS would be a game changer in a world that is moving towards inclusivity and the next few years are the ideal time to strike!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second thing is that it will be built "Accessibility First". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, didn't I already say that? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No this time I mean that all of the code it produces will enforce accessibility best practices and principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a component based drag and drop system and with some clever workflows and prompts this CMS will not only be accessible for those who use it for editing but it will also tackle the scourge of accessibility...content writers who break any accessibility work you do within weeks or even days!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should help make sure that the front end stays accessible without the need for an accessibility expert correcting things every few months!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall concept of this part is really simple, help businesses be part of the 2.6% of websites that don't have detectable accessibility errors! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But achieve this without adding any extra effort on their part, allowing them to increase the number of people they can reach and reduce the chance of excluding people, bad press and litigation under accessibility laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#fast-as-fast-can-be"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Fast as fast can be
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing that is important is speed and web vitals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are hundreds of tricks I have up my sleeve for this one but they key is in &lt;strong&gt;reducing flexibility&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah you heard me, I want to make a system that reduces the options people have as this will ultimately help keep their sites both on brand and highly performant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most CMS / site builders try to be all things to all people and therefore never work perfectly for anyone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would rather target this system at a particular set of companies who will benefit from rigidity and speed over the ability to move a button 5px to the left!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By utilising pre-built components that are customisable in style (via global styling decisions with certain contrast restrictions where it matters etc,) but carefully designed from a HTML / JS interactions perspective we can ensure they are accessible &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Couple that with a concept I call "Self Optimising Websites (SOW)" (a system where the browsers sends back information about the critical CSS on a page, image dimensions at certain screen widths etc. and optimises the site and "learns" how to make itself faster)  and this CMS is going to promise something nobody else can - 95+ on Page Speed Insights for every site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly the whole SOW system is something that really excites me, and no it isn't machine learning it is pure algorithms and careful structuring. But the concept could be a game changer in and of itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#designed-for-content-creation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Designed for content creation
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third pillar of this CMS is the way the content creation is handled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every CMS I have seen is clunky and doesn't offer any well thought out and optimised processes for creating high quality content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By providing tools for research, checklists, templates, wizards and more, directly within a predefined workflow, the system can make it easy for content creators to produce content that is higher quality and in less time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Couple it with a system that will assess the writing and document structure for things like reading age, skipped headings etc. and it should make even an average writer look great! Well that is what I hope as I need something to elevate my writing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combine all of that with a carefully crafted content creation calendar and checklists for promoting content after publication and you can see why this would be exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#more-unique-features"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  More unique features
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because you have stuck with me this long here are a few more features that will be part of the system that I haven't seen before!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;future article markers&lt;/strong&gt; - it is annoying when you are writing an article and know that an article you have planned would link nicely within the current article. The system allows for markers that remind you to fill in these links when the future article is released!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;research integration&lt;/strong&gt; - having all the research for an article in one place without having to jump between sites is super handy! I even have a plugin planned that makes the process of gathering research super simple!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;code snippets creator&lt;/strong&gt; - one for my fellow Devs! This snippet creator will have social sharing built in! It will link back to the snippet on the site automatically to fix the accessibility problems of "code in an image" that we are forced to use, and to drive traffic back to the site at the same time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know what, I will stop there (I was going to list a load of other features but I think I have given you a taste), you will have to follow me to find out more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ok-sounds-fun-is-there-anything-else"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Ok sounds fun, is there anything else?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah the last thing is my content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am about to ramp it up ready for the new year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My content is going to be a mix of updates on implementing systems and what works, revealing new toys for you to play with and mega series! (Oh and don't worry, there will still be some angry rants scattered throughout but probably not as often!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh wait, I didn't mention mega series yet did I? Let's fix that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help promote the CMS I have crafted and planned some series that run along side it beautifully and should hopefully provide some value back to the community (while also helping me develop the things I need for my product!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the series I have planned are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ultimate-ui"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Ultimate UI
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 80 in depth posts on 80+ different components that are carefully crafted from the ground up to be as close to perfection as possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They will include things like Right to Left compatibility and internationalisation, accessibility considerations, fall backs for older browsers, flexible styling options following a global settings pattern and they will be light-weight to meet performance targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim is to build a library of components that will form the front end and back end part of the CMS that are accessible, fast and provide a great User Experience&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#building-a-light-weight-analytics-system"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Building a light weight analytics system
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More and more people are turning their back on Google Analytics and I have some pretty interesting ideas on combining analytics with the Self Optimising Websites system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't tackle this if there weren't some other benefits to the company so you will have to follow me to find out why I would include this in the plan!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ultimate-guides"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Ultimate Guides
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a short series with only 6 articles planned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ultimate guide to forms on the web&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ultimate guide to images on the web&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ultimate guide to website speed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ultimate guide to HTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ultimate guide to WCAG&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ultimate guide to ATAG&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now these aren't your average articles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example: I am currently writing the "ultimate guide to forms on the web". I have over 100 different sections in it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently I have only written the &lt;strong&gt;first 2&lt;/strong&gt; of those sections and the word count is over 3500 words. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes these really are going to be mega reference pieces and anchors around which all other content is created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the idea behind this "dual purpose" thing I am implementing, the guides are to be used as internal reference when designing the CMS, for marketing and for content generation for other marketing channels (eBooks, infographics, twitter threads etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also serve a final purpose...as test beds for ideas on content creation workflows and for highlighting tools I need to build!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See, 10x thought process on everything!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#wrapping-up-finally"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Wrapping up finally!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you still with me after all that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have any idea what I am on about?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who knows, but one thing I do know is this is going to be spectacular (either a spectacular success or a spectacular fail! 🤣)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you found anything interesting and have any questions then the floor is yours, drop me a comment or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/InHuOfficial"&gt;DM me on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; if you prefer, I would appreciate the support if nothing else!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#keeping-track"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Keeping track
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;999 days remaining!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goals and tracking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;£0 monthly revenue / £1million annualised target&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 post released so far&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't wait to start adding more stats and targets to that list for you to follow along!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next article in this series will be on systemising my personal life and cover things like eating healthily, exercising and scheduling and how to minimise the time spent vs results!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, enough of my ramblings, see you all back here on the 1st September 2024 when I can see how much of my plan has come together and whether I hit the £1million mark! Until then I will see you in my next article (I hope).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Notify Bot : Github Action + Workflow</title>
      <author>Atharva Shirdhankar</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 23:19:32 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/star_trooper/notify-bot-github-action-workflow-2676</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/star_trooper/notify-bot-github-action-workflow-2676</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-workflow"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My Workflow
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#motivation-for-building-building-this-github-action-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Motivation for Building building this Github Action :
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are Open Source Maintainer or Contributor or a developer working with team which has huge number of members then you have definitely used Slack at one point. And as a developer we even used Github. &lt;br&gt;
Since I m Open Source Contributor and Maintainer many a times I have to find issues and take help regarding those from community members to solve that issue or direct the beginner contributor to proper issue . And mostly I have communicate and collaborate with other maintainer and contributors on Slack so I thought building this action which will surely save time of Maintainers and contributors .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#features"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Features:
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greet - When contributor of the project creates pull request a "Thank you" greet is send .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Issue Notification - When someone creates new issue few context like issue title, issue creator/contributor username and link to the github issue is shared on Slack channel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Issue Notification - When someone creates pull request few context like issue title, pull request creator/contributor username and link to the github issue is shared on Slack channel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-will-this-github-action-do-if-i-use-it-in-my-github-project"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What will this github action do? If I use it in my github project!!
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are maintainer of project this github action will surely save your time . And let help newbie contributors effectively and discuss them about the following issue on slack. You can direct new contributors to the good first issue and direct them properly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#submission-category"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Submission Category:
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintainer Must-Haves&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notification: Sends Message on Slack channel when someone create's issue or Pull Request.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greeting: Greets to the Contributors when they create new Pull Request&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;div class="gh-btn-container"&gt;&lt;a class="gh-btn" href="https://github.com/StarTrooper08/Notify-Bot"&gt;View on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-get-and-configure-tokens-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to get and configure Tokens :
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use this action + workflow we need 3 Tokens/API keys/Security keys:&lt;br&gt;
They are as following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Github Token : You don't need worry about this token since it will be automatically configured by Github.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tenor gif Token: &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go ahead and visit the &lt;a href="https://tenor.com/gifapi/documentation"&gt;tenor gif developer portal&lt;/a&gt; and sign up with gmail and get your free api key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After getting your Tenor Token you can go to your github repository where you want to setup this action then go to settings of that repository .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search for 'secrets' option. And then click on new repository secrets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give it a name and paste the token(eg.name: TENOR_TOKEN value: copied token from tenor gif portal).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slack App Token:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;a href="https://api.slack.com/apps"&gt;Slack App portal&lt;/a&gt; and click on 'Create an App'
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Nb81QGsx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/y30epf7blbxmbbs7viuj.JPG" alt="Image description" width="880" height="368"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After clicking on 'create an app' you will be asked whether you want to start from scratch or from app manifest we will go for 'from scratch option' &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6Ak6C2tE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/166sknhw588v82vxbme8.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6Ak6C2tE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/166sknhw588v82vxbme8.JPG" alt="Image description" width="672" height="476"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then one popup will arise asking for app name and to use it in which slack workspace.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1_D2ymOd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ge7re1p417kgzuwhedkl.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1_D2ymOd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ge7re1p417kgzuwhedkl.JPG" alt="Image description" width="655" height="605"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now search for Review scopes something like this option. Click on that button.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AYz09bb2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/j8on84j6xd8nv6itgpl2.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AYz09bb2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/j8on84j6xd8nv6itgpl2.JPG" alt="Image description" width="880" height="391"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;And add 2 scopes. Shown in the figure below.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Zhs9g8mu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mwqaztuzrvqyl54ibebd.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Zhs9g8mu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mwqaztuzrvqyl54ibebd.JPG" alt="Image description" width="852" height="469"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will see OAuth and Permissions option in the left side bar. Go to that option and scroll little down and click on  'install to workspace' to the workspace(workspace which we selected at the start)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6VDD0hy7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vcdq8k5xbw4hv1wtok0p.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6VDD0hy7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vcdq8k5xbw4hv1wtok0p.JPG" alt="Image description" width="782" height="593"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allow the App to join the workspace.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Zx1GzzNQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/aisyc72kjvks73d56aa8.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Zx1GzzNQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/aisyc72kjvks73d56aa8.JPG" alt="Image description" width="711" height="635"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After this above step you will see your slack app token copy it and store it in repository secrets similar to tenor token.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--N8byBFTV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9ei5utel6vroemt2flga.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--N8byBFTV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9ei5utel6vroemt2flga.JPG" alt="Image description" width="880" height="324"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lastly invite your app into the slack channel you want.
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--aJQ2xvVe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/31m53id9jx9njl82dz6a.JPG" alt="Image description" width="361" height="154"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-setup-this-action-workflow-on-our-repository"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to setup this action + workflow on our repository:
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the configuring the token stuff you are just few steps away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create &lt;code&gt;.github/workflows/my_action.yml&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After that paste this yml code into &lt;code&gt;my_action.yml&lt;/code&gt; file.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;name: Notify Bot

  pull_request:
      branches: [ master , main ]

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Wherever I have written &lt;code&gt;channel_id&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;args&lt;/code&gt; of the &lt;code&gt;notifyissue&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;notifyPR&lt;/code&gt; jobs in my_action.yml file put the id of the channel where you have install your slack app. You will get the channel id in the link of slack workspace&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;https://app.slack.com/client/[workspace ID]/[channel ID]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congrats You have Successfully added the Github Workflow🎉🚀.&lt;br&gt;

      <title>How to change the url of a remote git repo...</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently got myself into the situation where all my local git repos had the wrong remote addresses.  This was caused by a change up on our git account.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the url that git is currently using by opening the 'config' file in the .git folder.  You'll see it under the '[remote "origin"]' section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily this is pretty trivial to fix.  You can either update the url directly in the config file, or run the following command...&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;remote&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;origin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;git&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;xyz&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
