  Have you taken a huge leap of faith at work? Did it pay off?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. I had a Perl web scraper that I needed to update. It was old, ugly, messy. It used xml and wsdl, which I hadn't worked with before. But it really helped me understand a lot and learn a new language&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy International Women's Day!✨💖👯&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-most-recent-achievement-was" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My most recent achievement was…
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dream goal. One of the reasons I work in tech is because it allows us to work remotely easily. Last year, I got my first full remote position - which is my third and current job. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I very appreciate the company value non-technical expertise and people skills just as highly as technical expertise. The job was challenging from the beginning but I've learned so much there. If I hadn't been given the opportunity, I wouldn't have all that valuable experience behind me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#advocating-for-myself-looks-like" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Advocating for myself looks like…
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first would be allowing myself to take a break and rest. Next would be knowing I have a lot to learn and take it one step at a time. I've also learned to make sure I am comfortable with being uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-biggest-goal-is" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My biggest goal is…
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am keen to help inspire women from non-tech backgrounds to get into tech. It was really encouraging for me to see women from all kinds of backgrounds who didn’t have a Computer Science degree like me to work in the tech industry. And I always believe there were transferable skills between each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-advice-for-allies-to-support-underrepresented-folks-who-code-is" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My advice for allies to support underrepresented folks who code is...
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always be kind and support them in every possible way🌻 Be proud of what you achieved and learned in a time even if it is just a small thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have grown so much as a woman and a developer and I am still working on it but despite everything, nevertheless, I coded. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Dev.to, for the extra step of having someone reading the #shecoded posts and inspired other women through women's stories.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>To All of My Talented Sisters</title>
      <author>Negar</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 07 Mar 2021 23:00:55 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/negarjf/to-all-of-my-talented-sisters-28jk</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/negarjf/to-all-of-my-talented-sisters-28jk</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;"Why shouldn't I give it a try?" I wonder, sitting in the living room four years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing up, I always had huge dreams about my future, from being a superhero to becoming an astronaut. Hopefully, my parents never stopped me from dreaming big and never question any of my goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But around age 22, in the middle of my plan for becoming an astrophysicist at the physics faculty, I realized that this is not a job that makes me want to wake up every day and go back to work. I was feeling like that I had a plan for my life for years and now I am lost. I have always been the girl with the plan since I was 6 and now the same person didn't even know what should she do after graduation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was almost 4 years ago when my friend sent me a photo of a girl who was working as a developer and said "Look how successful she is!", that one picture made me wonder "Why shouldn't I give it a try?".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always been into technology. Ever since I've got my very first computer I couldn't get my hands off it. Even when I should study for my exams I rather read the book from the PDF instead of the physical book, just because then I didn't have to leave my computer. But programming was never something for me to think of. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The summer after my graduation I registered for a short frontend Bootcamp. Compared to the others in the same class I was one of the people with the least related background knowledge. I was scared and fragile. Compared to a person with a programming degree, I was lacking 4 years of studying. With all of that fears and doubts, I kept my mind open and gave all of my attention to the courses. Sometimes, I found myself opening the 20th browser tab to search for the meaning of another new concept just to be able to read an article to the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nine months later I found my very first job as a Frontend developer with HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, and Bootstrap on my skillset in my resume. I remember promising my employer in the interview that I won't be the same person in two months due to all the new things that would learn. I stood by my words and in two years of working in that team, I never let them down with anything that was assigned to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--C8FQrcic--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qqpdrjpfq74wacv1mjiq.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--C8FQrcic--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qqpdrjpfq74wacv1mjiq.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I start writing articles and making videos in my free time to share my knowledge as little as it was with the new fellow developers to help them have fewer struggles at the beginning of the road. With all the supports and encouragement that I've got from people online, there were always a few destructive comments, making fun of the simplicity of the topics or accusing me to get attention &lt;strong&gt;just because I am a girl&lt;/strong&gt;, not that I am doing anything valuable. I have to confess that some of these comments dissipate my motivation for showing up and providing more content for a while. But then I've learned no matter how experienced and professional you are, there are always some people feeling insecure about your growth and try to feel better by making you feel insecure on some levels. The best reaction to these destructive behaviors is to keep moving on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past four years, I've learned that you never know everything and you never have all the answers, even if you have all the degrees and experiences. I've learned that tools and frameworks can be learned in two months but what you need years of experience are the fundamentals that happen to seem less important and useful. I've learned that sometimes your soft skills, morals, and communications are more important factors to make you a valuable employee for a good company than the number of programming languages that you have mastered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month I proudly had a talk at the &lt;a href="https://frontenddeveloperlove.com/"&gt;JS World Conference&lt;/a&gt;, one of the conferences that I have always been dreaming about. And when it was happening it didn't seem like a dream anymore; It was reality, and it was achievable. I still have my doubts and fears when it comes to doing the things that I have never done, but from the bottom of my heart, I know that all the dreams can become reality, and then they won't seem impossible anymore. There is no such thing as a superhero because everyone can achieve anything, they just need to keep on trying and take a new step forward once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-journey-is-not-a-linear-path" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My journey is not a linear path
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My journey into tech has been a long winded process of finding myself and my own voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I graduated with a Pharmacology degree and worked as a Research Lab Scientist for 3 years. In those 3 years, I wanted to pursue PhD because I love research and data. I had a change of heart when I realised I didn’t want to spend the next 20 to 30 years going into the lab, putting on my white coat, experimenting both &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. I wanted to be creative but yet utilise my love for problem solving and learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left the field when I was diagnosed with endometriosis. The pain I experienced as a woman during ovulation and menstruation was unbearable. It took 3 years for that diagnosis, I spent those time in the lab and I think that was one of the deciding factors that I wanted to work in tech because there is a greater flexibility in working conditions, I could work with my laptop and tend to myself when I experience pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined a coding Bootcamp under apprenticeship - I went for an interview with a small BI company and I was really excited because I could possibly combine software engineering and data. I started the Bootcamp. I learnt a lot in 12 weeks but looking back, the learning style was a lot of ticking boxes and I wanted to go deeper into the subjects. I joined the company but I was the only developer with no outline of the projects I should be working on and was told to work on sales consultancy support. I was misled but I spent the whole time, hoping or wishing that there would be a project where I could utilise my skills but this never came. I quit after 2 and the half months for various reasons. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first job in tech set me back and I was left questioning my ability and whether or not a hostile and unsupportive work environment is the norm in tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I passed my Microsoft exam, quit my job and found out I was expecting. That was a lot of emotions in less than a month - happiness, excitement, anxiousness, self-deprecation and a whole lot more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was anxious about the pregnancy and what my future in tech will be. Will I have a second chance at it? Will I be able to reboot my career in tech? Am I capable of being a software engineer? Will I be ok taking a career break?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#fast-forward-20-months-later" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Fast forward 20 months later
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent my time during pregnancy dipping in and out playing around with Gatsby, coming up with project ideas that didn’t get executed and creating learning tracker and plans so I could use it after the birth of my baby. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t get to work on any projects or learning while I saw other new mums thriving in their learning with a young baby. I blamed myself for not being disciplined but the truth was, motherhood was not natural to me and I suffered with postpartum anxiety. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that my little one is 12 months old, I have learnt so much about motherhood and myself thus far - it taught me to be kind to myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am now hopeful for my future with my family by my side, friends who lift me up and supportive communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My recent achievements look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I found supportive moms-in-tech Slack group and Virtual Coffee community. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I created my &lt;a href="//www.cristien.xyz"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; to document my learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s okay to have a multitude of interests from design, web dev, data and machine learning (I tend to talk myself down for not being able to narrow my interests to one thing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was recently awarded a Bank of America scholarship to study Python with Code First Girls and currently enrolled in the evening classes for a month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have also accepted into Front End Foxes School - European region cohort 🦊 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allowing myself to take a break and rest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking kindly to myself when I don’t achieve what I need to achieve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I’ve learnt so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you have to be put in challenging situations to be true to yourself and speak up about what you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I quit my first job in tech because I wasn’t going to let myself be treated unkindly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I stopped coding for a bit because my family is my priority and fertility is not something I’m going to take for granted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I am back to code consistently and this time, with self-compassion and a sprinkle of self-belief that I can achieve my dream goal: to land a remote Software Engineering or Data Scientist role this year within an inclusive, supportive company who I can contribute my skills to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have grown so much as a woman and a developer who have struggled to find my voice. I am still work in progress but despite everything, nevertheless I coded. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy International Women’s Day!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After seeing the initiative that DEV is proposing for such a special day as 8 March, I didn't want to miss it, so I'm joining in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-biggest-achievement-this-year" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My biggest achievement this year
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, after the best professional year of my life, I decided to try my luck and try to join the company I loved, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/passionatepeoplenl/"&gt;Passionate People&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are not going to deny that I still have insecurities after 5 years in this sector, but what I see as important is that they do not stop me from pursuing my goals or my dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many times you have to do things that you don't feel capable of, like trying to get into the company of your dreams, but if you try, you will get there, so don't give up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here I am... 😱&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#women-in-tech-who-have-appeared-in-my-life" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Women in tech who have appeared in my life
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said, last year was completely crazy for me, for all the goals I achieved, for everything I accomplished in my working life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I owe it all to many women in this sector, for their support, for their help, for their strength and for making a place for us in places we were not part of!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I have to name someone first, it has to be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/debs_obrien"&gt;Debbie O'brien&lt;/a&gt;, we can say that Debbie is my shadow manager 🤣 She has been a crucial person in my life this last year, she has helped me to grow, to make an effort, to value what I do and above all to believe in myself, in my knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone told me a year and a half ago that Debbie would talk to me in a video call I would faint (she was like a divine being for me hahahaha)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another person who inspires me the most is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lauragift_"&gt;Gift Egwuenu&lt;/a&gt; how she manages to do everything she sets out to do, being everywhere and having time to cook, dance and go for a run, she is a superheroine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And my partner in crime &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/miriamgonp"&gt;Miriam Gonzalez&lt;/a&gt; could not be missing in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that the tech community has brought me is the opportunity to meet other people in online events during this year of confinement. One of them is Miriam, who is now a very important pillar, with whom I am setting up projects that make me live again a little and remember what it was like to have a laugh with friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to meeting more women in tech and joining forces 🤗&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-biggest-goal-for-this-year" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My biggest goal for this year
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contribute more to open source, encourage more women in the sector to participate, increase the female open source community, like &lt;a href="https://www.vuevixens.org/"&gt;Frontend Foxes&lt;/a&gt; has done for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to be able to mentor a woman who wants to enter in the Frontend world would also be awesome 🤩&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-advice-for-allies-to-support-underrepresented-folks-who-code" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My advice for allies to support underrepresented folks who code
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't turn a blind eye when a colleague is undervalued by their superiors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be human, if someone makes a mistake, don't whip them, remind them that we all make mistakes, that we are improving and learning thanks to having made them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Respect the speed of others, many people cannot keep up with the pace of another person, you have to try to give space and work adapting to the other person. That will make you both perform much better as a team!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thanks to all the women who have opened this path for others, who don't stop growing and surpassing themselves, we are warriors!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3U6foQyJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/m3b0uxdo4md0l9e2bo70.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3U6foQyJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/m3b0uxdo4md0l9e2bo70.gif" alt="Female warriors"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nevertheless, Jacque Coded, Even When She Wanted to Quit</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/jnschrag/nevertheless-jacque-coded-even-when-she-wanted-to-quit-3md5</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like many other people, my 2020 did not turn out the way I had thought it would. In January, I spoke at a conference and had more speaking &amp;amp; writing gigs lined up. I was anticipating a new role at work. I was excited, and ready to keep growing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time August hit, I was one breakdown away from quitting my job and permanently becoming a part of my couch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was depressed, miserable, stressed, burnt out...and embarrassed that I felt that way. Even with the perfectly valid reason of &lt;em&gt;gestures at everything&lt;/em&gt;, I was ashamed of how I felt and frustrated by my inability to push through it so I could get back to doing the projects I enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t publish a single new blog post in 2020, nor did I work on a single side project. But I did start seeing a therapist, and being more open with friends &amp;amp; colleagues about how I was feeling. The support &amp;amp; encouragement I’ve received has been amazing, and for now, that’s more than enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have days where I’d rather be a potato than a programmer. But I’m grateful for the creativity, joy, &amp;amp; delight that exist in this field, and want to continue to be a part of it even if I only have the energy to be a spectator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2021, I will continue to code, but not at the expense of my well-being. And if that means less talks, blog posts, and side projects, then that’s okay with me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Year I Finally Went After My Goals</title>
      <author>Shahed Nasser</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 07 Mar 2021 16:47:14 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/shahednasser/the-year-i-finally-went-after-my-goals-1lo</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/shahednasser/the-year-i-finally-went-after-my-goals-1lo</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although I think that I still have a long way to go, I feel inspired by others in the community and I hope I can inspire others as well to write their stories or go after their goals. So, I decided to participate and share my story.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-year-i-finally-started-writing" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Year I Finally Started Writing
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've always wanted to start a tech blog. However, I always felt intimidated and scared that my articles wouldn't be good enough or that I need to be at a certain level of expertise to be able to start one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to finally do it at the end of last year, then I stopped for a while due to some negative criticism. Then again I plucked up my courage this year and tried again, and thankfully I have been going strong and receiving a lot of comments that it has helped others. This has encouraged me to keep sharing my knowledge, and even learn more to share with others as well. I started learning new technologies and participate in certain challenges, then share what I learned.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#managing-open-source-projects" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Managing Open Source Projects
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also always wanted to contribute to open-source projects, but I felt unsure of where to start or how. So, in late September last year, I started my first open-source project &lt;a href="https://github.com/sButtons/sbuttons"&gt;sButtons&lt;/a&gt; and I've learned so much from it. I started it as a way to help other beginners to open source as well and working with the community has been motivating to keep improving myself. This encouraged me to start other open-source projects as well and gave me confidence.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#publish-npm-packages" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Publish NPM packages
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been able to publish 2 NPM packages recently, one for sButtons and one for &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-dark-mode-hook"&gt;use-dark-mode-hook&lt;/a&gt; for React. I gained courage due to the points I mentioned above. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#take-on-more-responsibilities-at-work" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Take On More Responsibilities At Work
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been working at my current job for almost 3 years now, and this year I gained the courage to take on more responsibilities, managing aspects of projects and working in different technologies. I used to feel like my opinions wouldn't matter much, or I would be saying the wrong things, but as I started speaking up more I realized the power of my voice and that I could do and be more.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-year-i-found-my-passion" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Year I Found My Passion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I've been working for many years now as a developer, it wasn't until this year that I started going after my goals, learning more technologies, and trying harder to improve myself and help others as well. After starting my blog and managing open source projects, I realized that this is not a job for me, this is a passion. I feel happy creating something new, solving problems, and connecting with the community as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, I would like to thank any person who has said any encouraging or nice words to me, as it helped me keep going as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nevertheless, She choose to challenge and coded. ✨</title>

  &lt;a href="#how-it-all-started" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How it all started
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year a time like this I didn't know how to code. But through a video I watched of how amazing women became self-taught developers, I decided to look around and use resources I could find. To be honest, at first, I was going in blind because I didn't have anyone in the tech industry. But a YouTube recommendation from &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/2i3v1BbKbs8"&gt;The come up about how to be a self-taught software engineer&lt;/a&gt; completely changed my view. &lt;br&gt;
When I told my friends and family that I wanted to change careers to tech, I could see the doubt and resistance in their eyes. Going to campus is the conventional route. My path of being self-taught was crazy and an illusion to them. But I do understand them, they love the safer route but to me, going back to Uni wasn't doable financially. I started using free resources like FreeCodeCamp to get me started. At the same time, I joined Dev to get more insight and got inspired by &lt;a href="https://dev.to/lydiahallie"&gt;Lydia Hallie&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://dev.to/ladybug"&gt;ladybug 🐞 podcast team of engineers&lt;/a&gt;. They truly shed light 🔆 on how to get started in the industry and how to change careers. That's how it all started, yes from a YouTube recommendation. 😁 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-most-recent-achievement-was" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My most recent achievement was…
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to join a small start-up that's passionate about code and they have now become my inspiration in the industry. &lt;br&gt;
I didn't expect to have a place there at first but they are so encouraging and help me along the way. As the only female web developer on the team, it made me want to work harder and bring more female engineers to the team. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-biggest-goal-is" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My biggest goal is…
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To inspire more youth around my community to join the tech industry. I believe anyone can do it, it's just a matter of finding someone who can guide along the way. Bringing more information on how to be a self-taught developer will change someone's life one day. Being part of that will be my greatest joy this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-advice-for-allies-to-support-underrepresented-folks-who-code-is" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My advice for allies to support underrepresented folks who code is...
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always stand up for those who can't speak up for themselves. Be their voice and work together for a better environment that's positive and supports all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#in-conclusion" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  In Conclusion
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn't want the post to be lengthy but I hope someone will be inspired by it. I believe we all have a part to play in this life, you can be someone's inspiration or role model without you knowing it. Keep pushing and keep fighting for your dreams. All it takes is taking the first step and working hard for what you want.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

  Journey
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funny thing about me being in tech today was the fact that I actually wanted it for a friend and ended up going into it myself 😂. It was literally a ‘um I don’t have anything doing right now, let me just try this. How hard can it be uh?’ moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I applied and got into a state coding program (CodeLagos) at the time in 2018 and my journey into tech started. Funny thing, first day of class, I got there very early and had to wait for my tutor and other classmates to arrive. I sat in a library around there and picked up a book to read to pass time, I became engrossed in the novel and when I checked the time, I was 20mins late for my class so I had to rush down to the class 🤦🏾‍♀️😂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay with me guys, still on the first day of my journey. They had an intro session which I missed and the tutor was already taking them on headings in HTML - you can imagine the confusion I was in Lmaoo. I was lost!!! I pleaded with someone beside me to put me through as the class was moving fast because the program was only 6 weeks for a web development course and we had a lot to cover. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to week 3, I was getting the hang of it and decided to embed my tweets in an assignment - a basic fast food website (ps: we weren’t asked to embed 🌚, I just wanted to do something that fascinated me) so after a series of googling, it worked and it felt sooo good that I had to share with my tutor that very night, he was pleased and shared it with the rest of the class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of the program, I had already gained a lot, made new friends and even a life long mentor(my tutor). I thoroughly enjoyed the experience, I enjoyed writing lines of code and seeing it become something so beautiful. After the program, I got an internship and started learning how to use WordPress to make websites and got on few projects during that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then took a year long break from Tech in 2019 to focus on other things while also battling imposter syndrome so I would like to think I started coding fully in 2020. I have gone on to be on multiple projects and even have projects of my own 🤩😊&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a week ago today, I wrote my first technical article - &lt;a href="https://dev.to/theflorz/how-to-make-wine-glasses-with-pure-html-css-328g"&gt;How To Make Wine Glasses With HTML &amp;amp; CSS&lt;/a&gt; and the turnout has been nothing but amazingggg!!! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I almost screamed a day after when I checked my dashboard and saw over 6k views, I had to share the news with my friends and asked them if it was normal to have that much view lool. The crazy thing was the views kept increasing day by day and today it has over 13.3k views in a week 🥳!!! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biggest one - the Google developer student club(DSC) at Masinde Muliro Univeristy in Kakamega, Kenya replicated the wine glass at a web session. The moderator gave me a shout out me on twitter, it was so surreal that I almost cried!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am really grateful for the reactions, engagements and feedbacks from everyone. Big shout out to my Peths Digital family and my best friend for encouraging and supporting me, love you guysss ❤️!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-affirmations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking breaks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not selling myself short - I love letting people know what I do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowing I have a lot to learn and taking it one step at a time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-biggest-goal-is" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My biggest goal is…
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reach a point in my career where I can positively impact people's lives and use my platform to help women, children and the less privileged. I know how it is to be torn apart by men in the industry, I wouldn't want anyone to go through that and I am making it part of my mission to help women going into tech.&lt;/p&gt;

  My advice for allies to support underrepresented folks who code is...
&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Give us the chance to do something great, we are also a working member of the society.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Listen to us&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Lastly, you can't be sexist or openly support sexism by not calling out sexists and call yourself an ally!!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sidebar" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Sidebar
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a woman, you're powerful, you're beautiful, you're strong and you're amazing. Keep your head high, pace yourself, keep being yourself, and let the world feel your impact. You rock ❤️!!!&lt;/p&gt;

  My most recent achievement was:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding a job at the start of 2021. I strongly dislike the different hoops someone needs to jump through to apply to jobs. The endless questionnaires, cover letters that some people claim don't get read anyway, uncompensated take-home projects no-one has time for, timed challenges,  etc. I once got a reply to a job application almost a year later. 😕 I seriously don't know what the next interview process will be like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Advocating for myself looks like:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking to my manger when something bothers me or I don't feel like my position in the company is safe. I think it's from my experience in other companies, but I am very hyper sensitive to people's reactions and how they speak to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is mentally draining to feel like you are not seen as good as an engineer as the rest of your team and that no matter how hard you're working and how many more hours you work you still feel like none of it changes a manager's perception of you and your competency as an engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/du5d9o1vf2nJ8EtNUN/giphy-downsized.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/du5d9o1vf2nJ8EtNUN/giphy-downsized.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-biggest-goal-is" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My biggest goal is:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work on more projects I can be proud of while maintaining a healthy work-life balance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-advice-for-allies-to-support-underrepresented-folks" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My advice for allies to support underrepresented folks:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyze what you've been doing to support minorities in tech. Have they left your company? Did you let them go because they didn't measure up to your standards? If you want them to succeed in your company, ask them how you can better support them. Do you have a careers page on your site talking about how much you value diversity and people's different backgrounds but it seems to be all talk? Work on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flexible hours are also important to me. You can't expect someone in a different time zone to constantly work at the same time you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is something else I want to address: recognize when you make mistakes and acknowledge them. I've had to bring up concerns about managers in previous companies and I always get praised for doing so but I feel like this happens too often and I'm tired of having to go though this experience.&lt;/p&gt;
