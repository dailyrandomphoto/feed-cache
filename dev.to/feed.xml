      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you know that when you deploy your React application which is created using 𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗲-𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗰𝘁-𝗮𝗽𝗽 or your own webpack configuration to a live website like Netlify, Vercel, Heroku etc, your entire source code is visible to everyone from the sources tab of the developer toolbar as shown in the screenshot of this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not an issue with the 𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗲-𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗰𝘁-𝗮𝗽𝗽 but all of the source code is added because of the source map&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;😲😲😲&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you definitely don't want everyone to see your entire source code If it's a private repository or you're working on a client project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an easy way to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a file with the name .env in your project folder with the below code inside it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so when you run 𝗻𝗽𝗺 𝗿𝘂𝗻 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 or 𝘆𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝗿𝘂𝗻 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 command from the terminal,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will generate a 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 folder with minified files without a source map that you can deploy to the production.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Decoding The Brain</title>
      <author>AaronDski</author>

      <link>https://dev.to/aarondski/will-i-ever-learn-code-5619</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/aarondski/will-i-ever-learn-code-5619</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer I am not a Medical Professional. This information is my own deduction on how the brain functions, when we learn something new. Links to my sources are below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning a new language can be more difficult than some people might realize. Or is it? There are a number of reasons, excuses and justifications that we all can use to avoid learning a new language... to say that, "it's just too hard." I, for one, am guilty of this unhealthy mindset. &lt;em&gt;Is this the way things are always going to be?&lt;/em&gt;, I thought, &lt;em&gt;Is there no way of escaping the fact that there are just some things I won't be great at (or even mediocre, by some standards)?&lt;/em&gt; I needed to know, and so I did some research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out, when you try to learn something new--like skills, sports, languages, coding, etc--there are many things happening simultaneously in your brain. I'm going to point out a few that stuck out to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) ##Dopamine&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dopamine is released in the brain when we do something that we enjoy; it's the chemical that makes us feel good. Simple enough. But what if we need to learn something that we &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; really enjoy, or that we don't even remotely like? Well it certainly makes it harder to listen to someone teaching on the topic. What if you had to learn that thing you had no interest in, but there was a large sum of money waiting for you once you had mastered the topic? Would you be more interested then? I know I would be. &lt;br&gt;
There is a very simple tactic we can use to motivate ourselves: set small objectives that can be achieved daily, which help to move you toward your desired destination. By doing this, we are not only establishing self-discipline, but we are creating miniature, daily "wins" by achieving goals, which makes us feel good (Dopamine), and produces motivation in us... and we may even then start to enjoy the topic or task at hand. (Disclaimer: there will always be subjects/projects that are not enjoyable). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dopamine is not only a great way to find things that we enjoy, but it is also a very helpful tool in the learning process. When there is more dopamine involved in your studying, your brain will find ways to reference those memories or thoughts, thus reinforcing what you just learned. So if you are on a topic that you don't particularly like, find a "carrot" to dangle in front of you. You will be amazed at what the brain is capable of, when it has a reason to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) ##Neurons &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neurons--you have around 85 billion of them. A neuron cell acts as a messenger, sending information in the form of nerve impulses (like electrical signals) to other neurons. This is how our brains access memories, operate our motor functions, and direct our speech, etc. So what does that mean when we are learning something new? Well, for everything that we already know, there are set pathways for our neurons to follow, but for things we &lt;em&gt;haven't&lt;/em&gt; previously learned, a pathway has not yet been created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the case when we don't know something: we "draw a blank" or just simply can't find the answer. In the event when we can come up with an educated guess or solution to something haven't learned, it is because our brains are trying to find a pattern or some common ground with something else we already know--a relative pathway for the information to move through. Say when you can't find a pathway, what does you brain do? It makes a new pathway, of course! You can think about making pathways like blazing a trail in a forest. Now we have a new pathway for the info to work with, but it's not that strong of a connection, (not a well-groomed, obvious trail). How do we make this connection stronger? Easy: use that pathway more. This is why repetition works so well to make things stick in your brain. Ever seen a cow trail? Same basic concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) ##BLC (Bilingual Language Control)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been a joint study on BLC done by Marco Calabria, Albert Costa, David W. Green, and Jubin Abutalebie. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This BLC ability is now established as the architecture of what our brain is assessing when it decides what language to use. This complex system involves cortical and subcortical (different areas of the brain) structures, each responsible for particular cognitive processes, such as goal maintenance, conflict monitoring, interference suppression, and selective response inhibition. Our brain will separate the 2 languages, so that they don't interfere with each other. Switching between languages is very hard at first, but the more you do it the less taxing it becomes. It is incredible to think that, without our instruction or even awareness, our brain is able to switch to a completely different way of thinking, in a matter of nano seconds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would surmise that this is applicable not only to spoken languages but to coding as well. Why not? They are "languages," after all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) ##Healthy Habits&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A.) Work well with others.&lt;br&gt;
Collaboration and collaborative learning have been a part of our human nature for as long as we know. We are inherently social beings and social learners. When collaborative learning techniques are used to support instruction, students tend to be more engaged, retain information better, and have better outcomes than those who prefer to be "solo learners."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B.) Don't be stagnant.&lt;br&gt;
Be constantly learning new things, even if they are small things. When you learn, you are increasing/maintaining good and healthy neuroplasticity. In a way, our brains are like &lt;em&gt;Play-Doh.&lt;/em&gt; If you don't use your &lt;em&gt;Play-Doh,&lt;/em&gt; it gets hard and dried out. Our brains don't literally dry out, but you get the point. Use it frequently, or your brain will begin to lose functionality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C.) Rest.&lt;br&gt;
Good sleep is one of the (if not &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt;) greatest ways for your brain to replenish, re-energize, and heal. A tired brain can't accomplish much.&lt;br&gt;
Additionally, taking breaks is more beneficial than you might realize. Spacing out your study time with small breaks (15-20 minute beaks every 2-or-so hours of studying) is very helpful in not getting "burnt out," because your brain is able to "take a breather between legs of the race" (as it were).&lt;br&gt;
My hypothesis is that it gives the brain time to strengthen and consolidate the connections between your neurons, and sort through necessary information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This greater understanding of how your brain functions and the use of supportive learning strategies can now allow you to help your brain to better learn!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Side note: Stay hydrated! Maintain a consistent intake of water... trust me! Your brain will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Learning Python-Basic course: Day 20, HashTables via Dictionaries</title>

  &lt;a href="#hashtables-and-information-retrieval"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Hashtables and information retrieval
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central theme behind hash tables is smart information storage and retrieval. The data must be stored in such a manner that it becomes very easy to search it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose we want to store a data of any thousand numbers ranging from one to a million. Using hashtables, we can efficiently store these numbers in a way which makes it easy for searching. This is possible only if we map the values to 'keys' The idea of hash table is to allow different possibilities of keys that might over to be mapped to the same location in an array. This is done with the help of 'hashfunctions' The hash function takes in a value and maps it to a key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example we might take the hash function as taking only the last three digits of the number. So, 45367 will go to the position 367, while 3769 will go to 769. In case of two numbers have same set of last three digits, we can use different algorithms to resolve collision. One way to do that is using 'chained hashtables' or linked hash tables. In this, lists are present in the hashtables instead of numeric values, where the values can be appended. The example below will make things more clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you are not familiar with hashtables, please visit the following references-&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="#simple-hashtable"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Simple hashtable
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us now see how to make a simple hashtable from using a dictionary. The user enters say five values, and we map them to a table of length ten. If the values of the keys overlap, then error message is generated and new value is ignored. This collisionj management will be handled by the next version of hashtable, i.e. linked hashtables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this program, we use a simple hashfunction given be the modulus operator as - &lt;code&gt;key = value % length&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Please enter an integer "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;#very simple hash function for length 10
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt; 
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;#to check if the element is already present in the position or not.
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"error-- value occupied!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OUTPUT-&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Please enter an integer 2
Please enter an integer 43
Please enter an integer 56
Please enter an integer 63
error-- value occupied!
Please enter an integer 78
{8: 78, 2: 2, 3: 43, 6: 56}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise 1)&lt;/strong&gt;-Modify the above code to map Unicode characters to the hashtable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#linked-hashtable"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Linked hashtable.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now create a linked hashtable, i.e. hashtable of lists. This way, we solve the issue of the keys in the same position. If there are multiple values for the same list, then the values are appended on a list rather than ignoring them. This method is used for fast data retrieval&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Please enter a number "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#append to original list exists.
&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#make a new list
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Please enter a number 23
Please enter a number 45
Please enter a number 65
Please enter a number 34
Please enter a number 79
Please enter a number 86
Please enter a number 54
Please enter a number 123
Please enter a number 457
Please enter a number 389
{3: [23, 123], 4: [34, 54], 5: [45, 65], 6: [86], 7: [457], 9: [79, 389]}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#retrieving-data-from-the-hashtable"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Retrieving data from the hashtable
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can retrieve the data from the hashtable very efficiently. In the same way as we added the data, we now will remove and display it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;b=int(input("Please enter the value"))
key=b%10
print(a[key].pop(b))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Answers as usual in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/Aatmaj-Zephyr/Learning-Python"&gt;learning python repository&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Hashtables are  one of the many many data structures present. For more information related to data structures and algorithms, please visit this series of blogs-&lt;a href="https://dev.to/ayabouchiha/series/13547"&gt;Data structures blog series by &lt;br&gt;
Aya Bouchiha on Dev.to&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;✌️So friends that's all for now. &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I've recently picked up interest in contributing to this platform (forem/dev.to) so I've been reading the documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm now stuck on the installation of ImageMagick. I run on Windows OS so im not sure if i'm to install ImageMagick on WSL or on my machine itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please help clarify. Thanks!!!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a story to tell but the story is different each time I am in a different universe. So, I want to show audiences those stories whenever they travel through different universes. For example, the story in finite vector space will be a little bit different from inifinite vector space. In another example, Disney world will have different themes and rides from Universal Studios. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My story is different a set of math universes that are rather focused on the different math textbooks and different proofs that each textbook brings in each book. So, I need to control the title of the book state and the axioms in each book state. I wanted to sync it and here it is how I did it. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setAxioms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;statements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;statements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;removeItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sentence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setAxioms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;unremovedItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/stackfindover/15-best-css-accordion-designs-you-ve-never-seen-before-10dp</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hello Friends, I have listed over 15 best css accordion designs made with HTML, CSS, and JS. Check out these excellent accordion examples which are available on Codepen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#awesome-accordion-design-2021-step-by-step"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Awesome Accordion Design 2021 step by step
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-1-creating-a-new-project"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 1 — Creating a New Project
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this step, we need to create a new project folder and files(index.html, style.css) for creating a simple accordion design. In the next step, you will start creating the structure of the webpage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-2-setting-up-the-basic-structure"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 2 — Setting Up the basic structure
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this step, we will add the HTML code to create the basic structure of the project.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;html&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;lang=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"en"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;charset=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"UTF-8"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;http-equiv=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"X-UA-Compatible"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"IE=edge"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"viewport"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;How to create accordion with css only&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;rel=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"stylesheet"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"style.css"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=IBM+Plex+Sans:wght@200;400&amp;amp;display=swap"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;rel=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"stylesheet"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is the base structure of most web pages that use HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the following code inside the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"accordion_outer"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"container"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;details&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Section 1&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/summary&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"details"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/details&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;details&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Section 2&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/summary&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/details&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;details&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Section 4&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/summary&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"details"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/details&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-3-adding-styles-for-the-classes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 3 — Adding Styles for the Classes
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this step, we will add styles to the section class Inside style.css file&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

      <title>As a developer, do you even bother with containerisation?</title>
      <author>Anthony Lapenna</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/deviantony/as-a-developer-do-you-even-bother-with-containerisation-3bob</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello there, trying to understand a bit better on how developers are actually using containers and solely for the purpose of developing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deploying containers to production is another concern and whether it concerns you or not is another discussion :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that docker-compose is a pretty common tool for creating a local development stack but are you using any other tools to use containers locally or do you actually don't bother with containers because what you want is just write code?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy to discuss!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Genius of Apple's Name</title>
      <author>swyx</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 02:11:17 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/swyx/the-genius-of-apple-s-name-2643</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/swyx/the-genius-of-apple-s-name-2643</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can hear me read this &lt;a href="https://swyx.transistor.fm/episodes/the-genius-of-apples-name-brent-schlender"&gt;on my mixtape here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently started &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3BsnXH3"&gt;the audiobook version of Brent Schlender's Becoming Steve Jobs&lt;/a&gt; and this passage on Apple's name made me stop in my tracks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are different tales about the origin of the name, but it was a brilliant decision. Years later, Lee Clow, Steve’s longtime collaborator on Apple’s distinctive brand of advertising, told me, “I honestly believe that his intuition was that they were going to &lt;strong&gt;change people’s lives by giving them technology they didn’t know they needed, that would be different from anything they knew.&lt;/strong&gt; So they needed something friendly and approachable and likable. He took a page out of Sony’s book, because Sony was originally called Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation, and [cofounder] Akio Morita said they needed something much more approachable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, adopting the name Apple foreshadows the expansiveness and originality Steve would bring to the creation of these new machines. It’s suggestive of so much: the Garden of Eden, and the humanity — both good and bad — resulting from Eve’s bite of the fruit from the Tree of Knowledge; Johnny Appleseed, the great sower of plentitude from American myth; the Beatles and their own record label, a connection that would lead to litigation years later; Isaac Newton, the plummeting apple, and the spark of an idea; American as apple pie; the legend of William Tell, who saved his own life and that of his son by using his crossbow to pierce an apple perched on the son’s head; wholesomeness, fecundity, and, of course, the natural world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple is not a word for geeks&lt;/strong&gt;, unlike Asus, Compaq, Control Data, Data General, DEC, IBM, Sperry Rand, Texas Instruments, or Wipro, to mention some less felicitously named computer companies. It hints at a company that would bring, as it eventually did, humanism and creativity to the science and engineering of computers. As Clow suggests, settling on Apple was a great, intuitive decision. Steve was innately comfortable trusting his gut; it’s a characteristic of the best entrepreneurs, a necessity for anyone who wants to make a living developing things no one has ever quite imagined before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know how many times I've looked at names like Asus, IBM, Wipro, and Texas Instruments and never reflected on how they are clearly less friendly than "Apple". It's obvious in retrospect — the best kind of obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Longtime readers here will know I have opinions on &lt;a href="https://www.swyx.io/how-to-name-things/"&gt;How to Name Things&lt;/a&gt; - mostly in code. It's easy to have strong opinions about stuff only developers see since user validation is just asking people like yourself. It's much harder to name something consumer facing. Here are some useful rules I gleaned from Apple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two syllables max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiar English word - literal 5 year olds can spell and pronounce it right&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starts with A - useful for alphabetical sort. &lt;a href="http://blog.idonethis.com/startup-name/"&gt;Amazon did this too&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name leads to easy logo/swag/branding ideas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evoke aspirational qualities - knowledge, health, nature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've vacillated somewhat on whether or not to use an English word for a name. My current company, &lt;a href="http://temporal.io/"&gt;Temporal&lt;/a&gt;, is an English word, and by sheer misfortune it exactly coincided with &lt;a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal"&gt;the Temporal JavaScript proposal&lt;/a&gt;. Given that we aim to &lt;a href="https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-node"&gt;release a JS SDK soon&lt;/a&gt;, this is regrettable potential confusion in every customer conversation. Whereas if you just make up a word, like "Netlify", or "Serverless", you not only ensure that you never clash with anyone, you also shoot right to the top in SEO results. Then again, people can just append "Apple Computer" or "Apple Macintosh" and do fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever you do, the worst outcome of naming something an English word is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zachleat/status/1387103114604470272?s=20"&gt;if it leads people to assume it does something different than you intend&lt;/a&gt;. It can help to do a sanity check by asking people to guess what your thing does without context.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="#51-what"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;5.1 What.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Redux middleware provides a third-party extension point between dispatching an action, and the moment it reaches the reducer. People use Redux middleware for logging, crash reporting, talking to an asynchronous API, routing, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="why"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#52-why"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;5.2 Why.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redux middleware were designed to enable writing logic that has side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Middleware like Redux Thunk or Redux Promise just gives you “syntax sugar” for dispatching thunks or promises&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="how"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#53-how"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;5.3 How.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In order to use Redux Middleware in your application, you need to import and use &lt;strong&gt;applyMiddleware&lt;/strong&gt; function from redux. It will help you to apply midllewares in your application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="when"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#54-when"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;5.4 When.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redux middleware is suitbale for medium or large applications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It help you to separate the business code and the view. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redux middleware were designed to enable writing logic that has side effects. As what mentioned, a Redux middleware can do anything when it sees a dispatched action: log something, modify the action, delay the action, make an async call, and more. Also, since middleware form a pipeline around the real store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;6.1. What is Redux Saga.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;redux-saga is a library that aims to make application side effects (i.e. asynchronous things like data fetching and impure things like accessing the browser cache) easier to manage, more efficient to execute, easy to test, and better at handling failures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mental model is that a saga is like a separate thread in your application that's solely responsible for side effects. redux-saga is a redux middleware, which means this thread can be started, paused and cancelled from the main application with normal redux actions, it has access to the full redux application state and it can dispatch redux actions as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sagas enable numerous approaches to tackling parallel execution, task concurrency, task racing, task cancellation, and more. Keep total control over the flow of your code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Advantages&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Simple, strong, easy to use, it is suitable for beginners&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;It is suitable for large scale applications. It helps us to write cleaner code and test the code easier when comparing with Redux Thunk&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Disadvantages&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;It is suitable for small applications.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;There is a learning curve for beginners and it is not suitable for small applications.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 2. Apply Redux Saga to Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is time to understand how Redux Saga works by applying it to our Netflix application. In the first part of this series, we built the login function. However, we just wrote a function to call Firebase authentication service when clicking on "Sign In" button. It is time to change the code by using Redux-Saga. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 1: We need to install &lt;strong&gt;redux-saga&lt;/strong&gt; by running npm install redux-saga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 2: Update &lt;strong&gt;store.js&lt;/strong&gt; file with the following code.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// import create store.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createStore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;applyMiddleware&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@reduxjs/toolkit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// import root reducer.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;rootReducer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./reducers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// import redux saga.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createSagaMiddleware&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;redux-saga&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// import root saga.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;rootSaga&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./sagas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sagaMiddleware&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createSagaMiddleware&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createStore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;rootReducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;applyMiddleware&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sagaMiddleware&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sagaMiddleware&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;rootSaga&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1st NOTE:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We import &lt;strong&gt;createSagaMiddleware&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;redux_saga&lt;/strong&gt;. This function is used to create a saga middleware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sagaMiddleware&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createSagaMiddleware&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, in order to apply redux middleare in our application, we need to use &lt;strong&gt;applyMiddleware&lt;/strong&gt;. In this case, it accepts the created &lt;strong&gt;sagaMiddleware&lt;/strong&gt; as the first parameter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The run method is used to enable saga in our application. It accepts &lt;strong&gt;rootSaga&lt;/strong&gt; as the first parameter. In fact, we can have many sagas in the application. For this reason, we need to combine all of them into a single root saga. The process is similar to combining many reducers into a single reducer. We will create the root saga at the end of the article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 3: We need to create &lt;strong&gt;services&lt;/strong&gt; folder, this folder is used to store services in the application. Services will take responsibility to interact with back-end services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 4: We are building the login feature. Therefore, we need to create &lt;strong&gt;AuthService.js&lt;/strong&gt; file in &lt;strong&gt;services&lt;/strong&gt; folder. This file will interact with back-end services which are related to auth functions.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// import firebase auth.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;firebaseAuth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../firebase/firebase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;login&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;firebaseAuth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;signInWithEmailAndPassword&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2nd NOTE: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to call Firebase authentication service. That's why &lt;strong&gt;firebaseAuth&lt;/strong&gt; will be imported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;login&lt;/strong&gt; function accept &lt;strong&gt;email&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;password&lt;/strong&gt; as parameters. It will be used in the following section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is time to create a login action (redux action). The login action will be dispatched when clicking "Sign In" button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step 5: Create &lt;strong&gt;AuthActions.js&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;actions&lt;/strong&gt; folder.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;LOGIN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;LOGIN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3rd NOTE:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;AuthActions.js&lt;/strong&gt; file, we define an action type. It is used to specify the type of the action when clicking on "Sign In" button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 6: Create &lt;strong&gt;sagas&lt;/strong&gt; folder. The folder is used to store different sagas in the application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 7: Create &lt;strong&gt;AuthSaga.js&lt;/strong&gt; inside &lt;strong&gt;src/sagas&lt;/strong&gt; folder. This file is used to specify sagas which are related to the auth function.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// import redux saga.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;put&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;takeLatest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;redux-saga/effects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// import auth service.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;authService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../services/AuthService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// import actions.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;loadingActionTypes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../actions/LoadingActions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;authActionTypes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../actions/AuthActions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;login&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;payload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;yield&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;put&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;loadingActionTypes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;SHOW_LOADING&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;userCredentials&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;yield&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;authService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;login&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;userCredentials&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;userCredentials&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;yield&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;put&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;loadingActionTypes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;HIDE_LOADING&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;yield&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;takeLatest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;authActionTypes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;LOGIN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;login&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4th NOTE:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We import &lt;strong&gt;call&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;put&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;takeLatest&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;redux-saga&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;call(fn, ...args)&lt;/strong&gt;: Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to call the function fn with args as arguments. fn: Function - A Generator function, or normal function which either returns a Promise as result, or any other value. args: Array - An array of values to be passed as arguments to fn. In this case, we use &lt;strong&gt;call&lt;/strong&gt; to call the auth service and the auth service will call Firebase authentication service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;authService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;login&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, we need to dispatch actions inside the current action, for example, we need to dispatch actions to show/hide &lt;strong&gt;Loading&lt;/strong&gt; component before / after calling back-end services. In order to achieve that, we need to use &lt;strong&gt;put&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;put(action)&lt;/strong&gt;: Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to schedule the dispatching of an action to the store. This dispatch may not be immediate since other tasks might lie ahead in the saga task queue or still be in progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;put&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;loadingActionTypes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;SHOW_LOADING&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;put&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;loadingActionTypes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;HIDE_LOADING&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;takeLatest(pattern, saga, ...args)&lt;/strong&gt;: Each time an action is dispatched to the store. And if this action matches pattern, takeLatest starts a new saga task in the background. If a saga task was started previously (on the last action dispatched before the actual action), and if this task is still running, the task will be cancelled. In this case, &lt;strong&gt;takeLatest(authActionTypes.LOGIN, login)&lt;/strong&gt; indicate that the &lt;strong&gt;login&lt;/strong&gt; saga will be used when an action with "LOGIN" type is dispatched.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step 6: Replace &lt;strong&gt;LoginForm.js&lt;/strong&gt; file with the following code.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// import useDispatch to dispatch an action to the store.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useDispatch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react-redux&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// import actions.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;authActions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../../actions/AuthActions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;login-body__form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Sign&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;login-body__input mb-16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Sign&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;login-body__options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Remember&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;me&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;login-body__need-help&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Need&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;help&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;login-body__footer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;login-body__fb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;New&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Netflix&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;            &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;login-body__sign-up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Sign&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;up&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;login-body__google_captcha&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

            &amp;lt;span className="login-body__learn-more"&amp;gt;Learn more.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
  );
}
// export LoginForm component.
export default LoginForm;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FINAL NOTE:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We import &lt;strong&gt;useDispatch&lt;/strong&gt; to dispatch redux actions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also import &lt;strong&gt;AuthActions&lt;/strong&gt; and call the login action with the following code:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;authActions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;LOGIN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;payload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;type&lt;/strong&gt; is used to specify the type of the action. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;payload&lt;/strong&gt; is used to specify the request body of the action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="conclusion"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this course, we have learn about Redux Saga by building Netflix. I hope that you can apply Redux Saga to your projects. If you feel the projects is useful, please help me share it to the community and give me Github ⭐&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Self-hosting with Supabase</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/chronsyn/self-hosting-with-supabase-1aii</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note that this article is a work in progress. Please leave any suggestions or questions in the comments.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relevant materials:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://supabase.io/docs/guides/self-hosting#configuring-each-service"&gt;https://supabase.io/docs/guides/self-hosting#configuring-each-service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-supabase"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Supabase?
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supabase is an open-source database solution based on Postgres. It includes all the standard features of Postgres with some killer additions such as realtime streams and a REST API. These are all backed up by incredibly powerful libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pros-and-cons-of-selfhosting"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Pros and cons of self-hosting
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons you might want to self-host Supabase:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;More database space - by using your own VPS, you could have a database that is many times bigger than what is (currently) available via Supabase managed platform&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full infrastructure control - you're in control of everything so if you need to make a change, you have that option&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also some reasons you may want to let Supabase host your database instead of self-hosting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's already setup - You don't have to have a significant level of technical knowledge to setup a Supabase instance on their platform&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Costs - They offer a free plan which may be enough for your needs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#who-is-this-article-for"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Who is this article for?
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article was written for people who want to self-host Supabase but have perhaps gotten lost with the self-hosting guides out there. Please be aware that at this time, the self-hosted options don't include the dashboard. If that's a deal breaker for you, this guide isn't for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get the most out of this article, it is strongly advised that you have some basic experience with the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nginx - Configuring endpoints / proxies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Docker - Deploying, configuring Dockerfiles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you're lacking those skills, I've done my best to explain the key parts, as well as the files you need to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be using Portainer to manage our Docker containers. We'll also be using our service behind Cloudflare. For this, we'll use &lt;code&gt;db.example.com&lt;/code&gt; as our domain name. This will be mentioned later in the Nginx configuration section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#getting-setup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Getting setup
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you should do is setup somewhere to host. I personally recommend DigitalOcean as almost everything can be done from the web dashboard. For the purpose of this article, if you see the word 'Droplet', this simply refers to a VPS which will host our Supabase instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supabase provide some one-click deploys for several platforms, but we won't be using those as they don't contain the full Supabase experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, we'll be installing Docker. Several VPS providers already have 'ready to deploy' Docker instances. I'd recommend using one as this can save you a significant amount of time compared to setting Docker up manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming you have setup a Droplet / VPS with Docker running, the first thing to do is install Portainer. To do this, follow the guide at &lt;a href="https://documentation.portainer.io/v2.0/deploy/ceinstalldocker/"&gt;https://documentation.portainer.io/v2.0/deploy/ceinstalldocker/&lt;/a&gt; . As of writing, there are only 3 steps needed to get Portainer installed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSH into your VPS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;docker volume create portainer_data&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -p 9000:9000 --name=portainer --restart=always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v portainer_data:/data portainer/portainer-ce&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, you need to perform some basic configuration for Portainer. In your web browser, go to &lt;code&gt;http://&amp;lt;ip-of-your-vps&amp;gt;:9000&lt;/code&gt; and follow the on-screen instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we need to setup Nginx. Fortunately, this is very easy with Portainer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optional tip before continuing:&lt;/strong&gt; Setup 2 volumes, &lt;code&gt;nginx-config&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;nginx-data&lt;/code&gt;, and then use those from the &lt;code&gt;volumes&lt;/code&gt; tab when setting up Nginx.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the left-menu of the Portainer dashboard, select 'App Templates' and from the list, select 'Nginx', and then follow the instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setting-up-the-docker-images"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setting up the Docker images
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you've got Portainer running, you'll need to get the Supabase repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, for the Supabase repo from &lt;a href="https://github.com/supabase/supabase"&gt;https://github.com/supabase/supabase&lt;/a&gt;, and then &lt;code&gt;git clone&lt;/code&gt; your forked version into a directory of your choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is to remove everything we don't need. For this, delete all folders &lt;strong&gt;except&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;code&gt;/docker&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're intending to use Nginx (as we will be in this article) Within the &lt;code&gt;/docker&lt;/code&gt; folder, you should remove the &lt;code&gt;/supabase-traefik&lt;/code&gt; folder as this will interfere with Nginx.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should then move the &lt;code&gt;/docker&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/dockerfiles&lt;/code&gt; folder to the root of the repo. Your directory structure should look something like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;- /docker
- /dockerfiles
--|-- /kong
--|--|-- Dockerfile
--|--|-- kong.yml
--|-- /postgres
--|--|-- 00-initial-schema.sql
--|--|-- auth-schema.sql
--|--|-- Dockerfile
- .env
- .gitignore
- docker-compose.yml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Inside your &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt; file, add &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt;. You'll be adding the contents of the &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file to the deployment configuration via Portainer, so it's nice to have something you can copy and paste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As per the docs, make sure you change the values of the &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, you may want to change some of the settings in &lt;code&gt;/dockerfiles/kong/kong.yml&lt;/code&gt;. In particular, changing the &lt;code&gt;keyauth_credentials&lt;/code&gt; sections at the bottom of the file. Using the JWT secret you created in &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt;, encode some new tokens at &lt;a href="https://jwt.io"&gt;https://jwt.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(More details: &lt;a href="https://supabase.io/docs/guides/self-hosting#running-supabase"&gt;https://supabase.io/docs/guides/self-hosting#running-supabase&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final step is to commit + push the repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#deploying-via-portainer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Deploying via Portainer
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going back to the Portainer web dashboard, select 'Stacks' from the left menu, and then click on 'Add Stack'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give your stack a name, and select 'Git repository'. For the repository URL, enter the full URL to your Supabase fork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under 'Environment variables' click on 'Advanced mode', and then copy and paste the contents of your &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, click 'Deploy the stack' at the bottom. This process might take a few minutes to finish. Once it is completed, click 'Containers' from the Portainer menu. You may notice that 1 of the containers isn't running. Simply select it, and then click 'Start'. It should then run without any issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your containers keep stopping, check the logs for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final step for this section is configuring the hostname for each Supabase service. From the containers menu item in the Portainers dashboard, select each Supabase container. Click on 'Duplicate/edit' near the top of the page. Then, scroll to the bottom of the page, select the 'Network' tab under 'Advanced container settings'. In the 'Hostname' field, enter the name of the service. For example, for the &lt;code&gt;supabase-rest&lt;/code&gt; container, set the hostname to &lt;code&gt;rest&lt;/code&gt;. You can set this to anything you like, but I recommend keeping it relevant to the container. Finally, click 'Deploy this container'. It will warn you that a container with the same name already exists - click 'OK'. After a short while, the container will be redeployed with the new hostname. Repeat these steps for each Supabase container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By doing this, it will help Nginx connect to the container and make it easier to identify in other parts of the infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#configuring-nginx"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Configuring Nginx
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to setup Nginx to support the various services needed for Supabase, we need to modify our Nginx config.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this, you need to SSH into your server, and then &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; your way to the volume where your Nginx config is stored. If you set up a &lt;code&gt;nginx-config&lt;/code&gt; volume as mentioned above, this will (usually) be located at &lt;code&gt;/var/lib/docker/volumes/nginx-config/_data&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here, we need to modify 2 files. The first is &lt;code&gt;nginx.conf&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside the &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt; section, add the following:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
    default upgrade;
    '' close;
}

upstream websocket {
    server realtime:4000;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The other file we need to modify is &lt;code&gt;conf.d/default.conf&lt;/code&gt;. There's many ways you can configure Nginx, but for the sake of simplicity, we're going to keep this to a single file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;conf.d/default.conf&lt;/code&gt;, replace the entire contents with the following:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name db.example.com;

    # REST
    location ~ ^/rest/v1/(.*)$ {
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        rewrite ^/rest/v1/(.*) /$1 break;
        proxy_pass http://rest:3000;
        proxy_redirect off;
    }

    # AUTH
    location ~ ^/auth/v1/(.*)$ {
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        rewrite ^/auth/v1/(.*) /$1 break;
        proxy_pass http://auth:9999;
        proxy_redirect off;
    }

    # REALTIME
    location ~ ^/realtime/v1/(.*)$ {
        proxy_redirect off;
        proxy_pass http://kong:8000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let me explain what's going on here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, our REST handler is listening to all requests sent to &lt;code&gt;/rest/v1&lt;/code&gt; path, as well as anything added after that part of the path. It is then routing it to the Supabase REST server, which by default will be accessible internally at &lt;code&gt;http://rest:3000&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, our auth handler is listening for requests to &lt;code&gt;/auth/v1&lt;/code&gt;, and routing them to the Supabase auth server, which is hosted at &lt;code&gt;http://auth:9999&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the realtime subscriptions are handled by the &lt;code&gt;/realtime/v1&lt;/code&gt; route. This routes those requests to Kong (which is utilized in Postgres to provide internal routing between services). By default, this is hosted at &lt;code&gt;http://kong:8000&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that realtime does NOT use the &lt;code&gt;rewrite&lt;/code&gt; directive while the other proxies do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason we perform this proxying is that it allows us to ensure that requests from the Supabase libraries (e.g. &lt;code&gt;@supabase/supabase-js&lt;/code&gt;) are able to correctly route to the different services in the stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may be able to route all services to Kong instead - I haven't tried this personally, and that's probably a better option. In that situation, you may not need to use the &lt;code&gt;rewrite&lt;/code&gt; directive. If you try this, leave a comment with your findings!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you've made the changes, save the file, and restart the Nginx container from the Portainer dashboard. To make sure everything is working as expected, select the Nginx container and then 'View logs'. It should indicate that everything is running as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, from the Nginx container (in the Portainer dashboard), connect it to the &lt;code&gt;supabase_default&lt;/code&gt; network - the option to do this is found at the bottom of that page in the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#final-checks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Final checks
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, everything should be running as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should be able to connect to your Postgres server using your VPS IP address, port 5432, and using the username &lt;code&gt;postgres&lt;/code&gt; and the postgres password you setup inside the environmental variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#closing-notes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Closing notes
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As stated previously, this article is a work in progress. I am still working through some of the finer details of configuring the Supabase stack for self-hosting. There might be some things missing from the article - leave a comment to let me know, and I'll look into adding it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting up Supabase for self-hosting is by no means a quick task, and there's still room for improvement. Hopefully, this article will help speed up the process for you and set you off on the journey.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>All JS String Methods In One Post!</title>
      <author>Aya Bouchiha</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 01:12:39 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/ayabouchiha/all-js-string-methods-in-one-post-4h23</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/ayabouchiha/all-js-string-methods-in-one-post-4h23</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello everybody, I'm &lt;a href="https://t.me/AyaBouchiha"&gt;Aya Bouchiha&lt;/a&gt;, on this beautiful day we're going to discuss &lt;strong&gt;all string methods&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Javascript&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, we need to know that all All methods do not change the original string, they return a new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#concat"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  concat()
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;concat()&lt;/strong&gt; : this method links together two strings or more.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Aya &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;lastName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Bouchiha&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 3 methods to concatenate two strings&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;lastName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Aya Bouchiha&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;lastName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Aya Bouchiha&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;lastName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Aya Bouchiha&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#match"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  match()
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;match()&lt;/strong&gt;: used to searches a string for a match against a regular expression, and returns the matches as an Array.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;quote&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;If you don't know where you are going, any road will get you there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;quote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/you/g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// [ "you", "you", "you" ]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#matchall"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  matchAll()
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;matchAll()&lt;/strong&gt;: returns an iterator of all results matching a string against a regular expression, including capturing groups.
&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/matchAll"&gt;more details...&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;conversation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Hi, I'm Aya Bouchiha\nHello, I'm John Doe, nice to meet you.`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;matchedArrays&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;conversation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;matchAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/I'm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\s(?&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;firstName&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;a-zA-Z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;)\s(?&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;lastName&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;a-zA-Z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/gi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;matchedArrays&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;matchedArray&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;matchedArrays&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;lastName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;matchedArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;groups&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;lastName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Output:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;I'm Aya Bouchiha&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Aya&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Bouchiha&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Hi, I'm Aya Bouchiha&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Hello, I'm John Doe, nice to meet you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;groups&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;prototype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Aya&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;lastName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Bouchiha&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Aya&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Bouchiha&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;John&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Doe&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#split"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  split()
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;split(separator)&lt;/strong&gt; : convert a string to an array by splitting it into substrings.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;replace(searchString, newValue)&lt;/strong&gt;: is a method that returns a new string with some or all matches of a pattern replaced by a replacement. The pattern can be a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;string&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; or a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;RegExp&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and the replacement can be a string or a function to be called for each match. If a pattern is a &lt;strong&gt;string&lt;/strong&gt;, only the &lt;strong&gt;first&lt;/strong&gt; occurrence will be replaced.&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace"&gt;more details&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;search(valueToSearch)&lt;/strong&gt; : returns the position (&lt;em&gt;index&lt;/em&gt;) of a specific value in a string, if the specific value does not exist in the string, it returns -1.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;includes(value)&lt;/strong&gt; : this method checks if a giving value exists in a string. if the value exists, It returns &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, otherwise, It returns &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;false&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tolocaleuppercase"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  toLocaleUpperCase()
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;toLocaleUpperCase()&lt;/strong&gt; : returns a given string with uppercase letters according to locale-specific case mappings. It's the same thing with &lt;strong&gt;toLocaleUpperCase&lt;/strong&gt; but this one returns the string with uppercase letters.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;repeat(n)&lt;/strong&gt; : returns a string repeated &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; times.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;aya&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  slice()
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;slice(startIndex = 0, endIndex = str.length)&lt;/strong&gt; : is a string method that extract a specific part of a string. It is simillar to &lt;strong&gt;substring&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript-difference-between-string-slice-and-string-substring/"&gt;difference between slice and substring...&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#substr"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  substr()
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;substr(startIndex, length=string.length)&lt;/strong&gt; : returns a specific part of a string, starting at the specified index and extending for a given number of characters afterwards.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  chartAt()
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;chartAt(index = 0)&lt;/strong&gt; : this method returns the character at a giving index in a string.
Note: &lt;code&gt;0 &amp;lt;= index &amp;lt; string.length&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#charcodeat"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  charCodeAt()
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;charCodeAt(index)&lt;/strong&gt;: method returns an integer between 0 and 65535 representing the UTF-16 code unit at the given index.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#startswith"&gt;

  startsWith()
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;startsWith(valueToSearch, startingIndex = 0)&lt;/strong&gt; : returns &lt;strong&gt;true&lt;/strong&gt; if a string starts with a giving value, otherwise It returns &lt;strong&gt;false&lt;/strong&gt;;

  lastIndexOf()
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;lastIndexOf(value, start)&lt;/strong&gt; : returns the position of the last occurrence of a specified value in a string. It searches the string from the end to the beginning, but returns the index s from the beginning, starting at position 0.
If the value is not found, It returns &lt;strong&gt;-1&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;localeCompare(stringToCompare, locales)&lt;/strong&gt; :  returns &lt;em&gt;-1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;1&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;0&lt;/em&gt; if the string comes &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt;, or is &lt;em&gt;equal&lt;/em&gt; in sort order.&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/localeCompare"&gt;more details&lt;/a&gt;
