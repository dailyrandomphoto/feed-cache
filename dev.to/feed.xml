      <title>Intro to Music NFTs</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRIMER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NFTs are simply: digital containers that hold any form of media. We then create scarcity by setting limited editions (i.e. you can make a music NFT to be a 1/1, so only one person can own it, creating demand, thus creating value). NFTs also have an embedded “smart contract” in them that allows the creator to set percentages on how much royalties they receive every time their work is resold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artists now have a new way of capitalizing their music, especially for furthering engagement within their community. Fans now have a way of “owning” digital artworks, all securely documented on the blockchain. NFTs enable engagement with your audience, for example, selling a one-off collectible digital item, selling super limited/rare works (B sides, unreleased materials, original one-offs, special edition NFT releases, digital assets, or creating your own currency for example for exclusive access to your content, or shows). Your audience can now become seed investors. It reinforces a personable artist to fan relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;❗ If you’re up for a read, here’s a significant article from earlier days that holds some of the basic ideas of why we'd mint music: newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/crypto-will-fix-the-music-industry&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I don’t want to get into politics too much, a lot of this may sound like wishful thinking. I think we’re still in early stages so everyone is still figuring this out, but in general, the main ideas are there. Some quick points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 — Established artists have a leg up! If you have a following, it would be silly not to bank on this IMO. You’re simply using new tech to tap into a market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 — Audience decides the value of the work by auctioning to the highest bidder, but artists can set a starting bid too&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 — Most music NFTs lean towards Ethereum for the most part (most of these platforms revolves around ETH, WETH, or their own crypto). For example Rarible is a NFT platform that has its own RAR coin. Foundation has its own FND coin, etc. Ethereum is basically Bitcoin except it holds the smart contract technology embedded into it, so it’s compatible with NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 — People treat digital equally with physical, and fans want to own things directly from the artist, they want to be able to say they own it and have their name on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5 — Artists are looking for autonomy, so here's a way to be platform agnostic: self-publish your music&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some interesting things being discussed today with licensing and publishing - maybe in the future we’ll be able to NFT any music samples, so that music will be thoroughly attributed and all creator royalties are accounted for through the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, a quick note about how the music industry works: a lot of people shun the "middlemen", which in some ways, is understandable because musicians are exploited and undervalued in an antiquated music industry.  NFTs can empower artists to self-publish in theory, but in reality, minting a music NFT is not going to launch your music career or give you visibility. Sometimes the "evil" middlemen are exactly who musicians rely on to further their music's visibility. In a sense, streaming platforms put musicians on a map, despite the highway robbery. Point being is many musicians today struggle with getting their work out there and NFTs won't enable that, however it can be a vehicle and tool to enable you as an artist. If you establish yourself as an artist and gain a community around it, the potential for NFTs are immeasurable. This is exactly what you'd be looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW TO MINT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 — Setup a wallet. I use Rainbow as a wallet. There’s also metamask. I'd say buy around $50-100 in Ethereum to get started. I buy my ETH off of Coinbase because it’s become established as a trustworthy ledger. I have the apps installed on my Chrome browser as extensions, and apps on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 — Find the platform you want to mint on. Some platforms are invite only. I added some links below. If you can get an invite to Foundation or Superrare, that would be extremely valuable right now. Opensea/Rarible are open to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connect your wallet to the desired platform (usually a button to connect the wallet on the corner of the main page of Zora.co for example). A platform that specifically does music (like catalog.works) would be ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 — Create a new NFT. Set your ownership percentages and other parameters. I’m more than available to help you once you get to this stage. If you have any questions, just reach out. Basically there are GAS fees for listing a NFT, so you have to pay fees to the platform of course, that’s where they getchya -_-. These gas fees fluctuate based on mass user activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the NFT is minted it then becomes biddable and folks collect them. Someone might buy a NFT and wait until someone offers them a deal to resell it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are dreaming up ways on how to show a music collection within a virtual vinyl record collection user-interface, for example. People are realizing there's value in art again, thanks to NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disclosure minted an unreleased song they made on a livestream on Twitch, here’s what it looked like on Zora: zora.co/collections/zora/1267. I'm looking into catalog.works more closely now, I think it'd be a strong move for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LINKS/resources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;❗ catalog.works — an example of where music NFTs are sold as platform, I think Catalog is an up and coming one and I notice some underground electronic acts joining in. Specific to music only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;fwb.help — FWB is community centered “DAO”, they created their own currency and in exchange you get access to a thriving creative community (I would take a look into accessing the FWB Discord, there are resources there, although in order to join you’d have to invest in their FWB coin. And also, it recently got a huge media pressing so I’m sure there’s a lot of buzz around this right now). I would look into them just to understand the philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hicetnunc — an underground, art focused, place to mint NFTs. I would mint some one-off limited edition art through here, or maybe a Bside, or maybe a single or whole EP. I think this is a sorta environment where you’d meet other aspiring artists, and not just a bunch of bros who want to get rich off of a GIF or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;foundation.app — A lot of artists I follow are on here, also Superrare is another one. If you can get invites onto these I’d say it’s super worth it/super in demand to get access to these platforms that mint ANY form of media&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zora is another NFT platform&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;opensea.io — NFT platform, similar to rarible, doesn’t require an invite to join&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;submerge.fm I found this while writing this and it looks awesome! Seems to be a new one up and coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;audius.co seems to be NFT friendly place to share music, crypto-centered&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unrelated: I get my crypto news usually from Coindesk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethereum is being reapproached into Ethereum 2 to be more economical in gas fees and more environmentally conscious. I believe Bitcoin is following similar protocols. Crypto does exhaust energy resources in an exaggerated scale but this is being attended to and will get better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPERIMENTAL IDEAS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can create a generative ambient piece and sell it? for example, you could create a series of completely original compositions, or an AI ambient piece that is always generating sound. NFT artists love combining code into their work, sometimes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Release a field recording as a NFT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mint an unreleased EP or single&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mint the artwork of a music release&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mint a music video&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mint a Splice pack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patreon model. Mint exclusive behind-the-scenes “access pass” that provides things like behind the scenes videos of the artist writing and recording specific songs, or a deeper glimpse into the personal life of the artist. You can set up a contract to offer tiered fan systems like discounts, backstage access to shows in their cities, a one-to-one video call with the artist, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made this for fun and it was fun to make this. I hope you find it helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>8 UI/UX tips about password design</title>
      <author>Clément</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 10:25:28 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/jacquelinclem/8-uiux-tips-about-password-design-5bbn</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/jacquelinclem/8-uiux-tips-about-password-design-5bbn</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the multiplication of saas (service as a software) these last years and the security problems linked to the fact of having an identical password for each service, I find myself using the « Forgot password » page much more often than before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this can be corrected beforehand thanks to password managers such as 1Password or LastPass, with the « no password » methods implemented by tools like Slack or the social login here are a few UI/UX tips to apply to the design of your « Login » and « Forgot password » pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users who try to log in, create a new password or reset their password will be eternally grateful to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-add-a-button-to-hint-the-password"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Add a button to hint the password
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to do to avoid mistakes is to offer your users the possibility to see the characters they just typed in the password field. This feature is often represented by an « eye » icon on the right of the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s simple, basic, as my favorite singer would say but it’s not always available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who know the browser console (press F12 now and enter a wonderful world) you can simply change the type= »password » of the password field to type= »text » and see what you have written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Pzm_fCaD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c3najof2gxn56gcygkks.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Pzm_fCaD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c3najof2gxn56gcygkks.png" alt="Hint the password" width="880" height="457"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-show-if-the-caps-lock-key-is-on"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Show if the Caps Lock key is on
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tell your users if the Caps Lock key is enabled when they type their password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don’t worry if it’s not, there is no need to display the text « Caps Lock is Off ». Few users will see the message and act accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EsTP1oEg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d35m4coyg59syje4lx7t.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EsTP1oEg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d35m4coyg59syje4lx7t.png" alt="Caps lock key is on" width="880" height="296"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-show-if-the-num-lock-key-is-on"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Show if the Num Lock key is on
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same UI/UX design practice can be applied with the Num Lock key&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PQGWl3gK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/05cdjt1o9nlus8f01o7e.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PQGWl3gK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/05cdjt1o9nlus8f01o7e.png" alt="Num Lock key is on" width="880" height="296"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-limit-password-conditions-and-display-them"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Limit password conditions and display them
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Display precise explanations when creating the password, don’t hide them in an tooltip to bring them out only when your user makes an error. Save him time and frustration. A real time validation is also a real plus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XrwnsETL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qbsyfq6w8n14l8xddj1t.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XrwnsETL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qbsyfq6w8n14l8xddj1t.png" alt="Limit the password conditions and display them" width="880" height="358"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-show-the-conditions-required-when-creating-the-password"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Show the conditions required when creating the password
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember… It was 6 months ago, to create his password you asked your user to add:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least 1 uppercase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least 1 number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least 8 character&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the last 3 digits of his credit card (Wait, what? Did you really ask that?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A security measure, a fashion effect, a copy cat because the competitor was doing the same or a useless waste of time? It doesn’t matter, you did it. And today he doesn’t remember these constraints that you imposed. So if he makes a mistake while login, make his life easier and remind him. Remind him the conditions required days, weeks, months or years ago, I promise you it will help him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--I123ZbXX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5dkhmkrzf5ze2ncfsqx8.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--I123ZbXX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5dkhmkrzf5ze2ncfsqx8.png" alt="Show the conditions" width="880" height="344"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-delete-the-password-confirmation-field"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. Delete the password confirmation field
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you follow the previous steps, especially the one that allows the user to see what they are writing, then the password confirmation field that was a safety feature (a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away) to avoid errors becomes obsolete. It’s already a pain to type the password once, don’t make it twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5W_sjzCX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/emq9b3z2e0r5ers0duup.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5W_sjzCX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/emq9b3z2e0r5ers0duup.png" alt="Delete the password confirmation field" width="880" height="681"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#7-fill-the-email-field-on-the-forgot-password-page"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  7. Fill the email field on the forgot password page
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process when your user realizes he have forgotten their password often looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comes to the login page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Types in his credentials&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Receives an error message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Realizes that he does not remember his login information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clicks on the link « Forgot your password »&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s where the magic happens, because at this point in the user’s journey, you already know their email address. Yep. They just typed it in a few seconds ago. All you need do to is to fill it on the present page so that they don’t have to write the same things over and over again. Remember in design every second saved matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qacvdd8p--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/86wlsbkinat43d9fqi2h.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qacvdd8p--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/86wlsbkinat43d9fqi2h.png" alt="Fill the email field" width="880" height="492"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#8-suggest-creating-a-new-password-rather-than-automatically-generating-a-new-one"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  8. Suggest creating a new password rather than automatically generating a new one
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who’s going to remember your long, complicated machine-generated password? Spoiler Alert: no one. Whether it is for security reasons or to let the user use his password manager, it’s better to let the user create a new password rather than randomly generate one in the email they will receive from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ThygD8Og--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c1eir5f2qanyn6nxkvi2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ThygD8Og--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c1eir5f2qanyn6nxkvi2.png" alt="Link to new password generation" width="880" height="582"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tldr"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  TLDR:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is 8 UI Tips to make the life of your user easier on your login and password lost pages. Remember, less friction is more conversion. You don’t want to spend time fighting with bad interface, neither does your user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a button to hint the password&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show if the Caps Lock key is on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show if the Num Lock key is on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit password creation conditions and display them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show the conditions required when creating the password&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not add a password confirmation field&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pre-fill the email field on the forgot password page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suggest creating a new password rather than automatically generating a new one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

  Description
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(15 mins) My research and career. My PhD. research was about data warehouse architecture modelling, investigation, and evaluation. I also did some research on novel concepts and state-of-the-art technologies for data management in the context of big data.&lt;br&gt;
After my Ph.D., I joined a project as a postdoc researcher. This project used deep learning models to investigate gait data for health. It is the first system to provide gait analysis as a service generating spatial and temporal gait features from videos. Currently, I am working in a start-up company, which provides insights into what's happening and what's working (or not) for staff in a company. It also enables Leaders and HRs to make faster and better decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

  Bio
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data Scientist at Wrky (Dublin City University). I have been using Python for a couple of years during my research and current work. Before Python, I was using c++ and Java to build up systems, websites and analyse data. But when I needed to analyse more data and run machine learning and deep learning models more effectively and efficiently, I started using Python as the main programming language.&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Machine learning flavours</title>
      <author>Rishal Hurbans</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 10:16:23 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/rishalhurbans/machine-learning-flavours-2ac8</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/rishalhurbans/machine-learning-flavours-2ac8</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Machine learning is useful only if you have the right data and have questions to ask that it might be able to answer. Machine learning algorithms find patterns in data but cannot do useful things magically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5TYW-zUg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/afk0tbjxt7bomhtrplvq.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5TYW-zUg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/afk0tbjxt7bomhtrplvq.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="707"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most common techniques in traditional machine learning is called supervised learning. We want to look at data, understand the patterns and relationships among the data, and predict the results if we are given new examples of different data in the same format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regression involves drawing a line through a set of data points to most closely fit the overall shape of the data. Regression can be used for applications such as finding trends between marketing initiatives and sales, or determining rent like in the next example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eqgsUJ0u--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/of4afj54t40cpokchg9t.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eqgsUJ0u--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/of4afj54t40cpokchg9t.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="881"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple example of supervised learning: &lt;a href="https://rhurbans.com/machine-learning-intuition/"&gt;https://rhurbans.com/machine-learning-intuition/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classification aims to predict categories of examples based on their features. Can we determine whether something is a car or a truck based on its number of wheels, weight, and top speed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--n8aED5va--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/awp9xq5yax4y544sthra.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--n8aED5va--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/awp9xq5yax4y544sthra.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="285"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsupervised learning involves finding underlying patterns in data that may be difficult to find by inspecting the data manually. Unsupervised learning is useful for clustering data that have similar features and uncovering features that are important in the relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On an e-commerce site, for example, products might be grouped based on customer purchase behavior. If many customers purchase soap, sponges, and towels together, it is likely that more customers would want that combination of products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reinforcement learning is inspired by behavioral psychology and operates by rewarding or punishing an algorithm based on its actions in an environment. It has similarities to supervised learning and unsupervised learning, as well as many differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QVdIX-OH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pegopoe287b7iaff3bm3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QVdIX-OH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pegopoe287b7iaff3bm3.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="801"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hackathons are a great place t learn, build, discover new ideas and make new friends too. You will also agree with me that empowerment of individuals is a key part of what makes open source community work, since in the end, innovations tend to come from small groups created during events like Hackathons. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order for you to take part in a Coding and programming challenge, you will need to find a good event for you, which will not only give you exposure but also give you an opportunity to meet amazing team of developers globally. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a tone of links about this events, which may seem tiresome going through, in this article I have collected a list of Hackathons happening this November, which is a result of organizations who have teamed up to create opportunities for developers to not only learn but also win amazing gift and swag 😍, who doesn't love them. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>6 Things Pokémon Cards Will Teach You About Design</title>
      <author>Mishacreatrix</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 10:12:44 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/mishacreatrix/6-things-pokemon-cards-will-teach-you-about-design-pnc</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/mishacreatrix/6-things-pokemon-cards-will-teach-you-about-design-pnc</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pokémon cards are so hot right now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/06/the_Pok%C3%A9mon_company_sold_a_staggering_3_7_billion_Pok%C3%A9mon_cards_last_year"&gt;nintendolife.com&lt;/a&gt;, the Pokémon company sold 3.7 billion cards in 2020 + 2021. Even though the Pokémon franchise is now 25 years old, it's still highly popular among all age groups, especially Pokémon cards. Those who grew up with it, and those just learning about it are buying Pokémon cards left and right to complete their collections, battle against others, or sell them on for a profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having gone down the rabbit hole of actually buying Pokémon cards myself, I've found there are a number of valuable things they can teach you about design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you're interested to learn what Pokémon cards will teach you about design, this article is just for you. I've put together a list of 6 things you can learn from and apply to your own designs to become a better designer, all thanks to Pokémon cards.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-use-color-to-convey-meaning"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1 Use Color To Convey Meaning
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Color is used to convey the Pokémon type. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm going to assume you have some level of knowledge of Pokémon and you know about types of Pokémon and their strengths and weaknesses. If this is completely new to you, here's a resource you can check out: &lt;a href="https://Pok%C3%A9mondb.net/type"&gt;Pokémon Types &amp;amp; Type Chart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a very high level overview, Pokémon are assigned a certain type (fire, water, normal etc) and each type can have strengths and weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an important factor for Pokémon trainers to consider so this makes type a very important piece of information to include on Pokémon cards. With that in mind, let's take a look at this Pikachu card and see how it's done:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DNOGhis_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fcgf1jztvptrbj46zu2p.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DNOGhis_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fcgf1jztvptrbj46zu2p.png" alt="Pikachu Card" width="880" height="440"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The color used on each Pokémon card conveys meaning, in this case the Pokémon type. It's pretty obvious this Pokémon is electric type because the entire card is a shade of yellow. There are other components that also denote the type but color is the most easily recognizable factor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a highly effective use of color and something you can learn from and apply to your own designs.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-dont-rely-on-color-alone-to-convey-meaning"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2 Don't Rely On Color Alone To Convey Meaning
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned this above but color isn't the only way to identify the Pokémon type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the top right corner of a card is the type symbol. Looking at the Pikachu card again, we can see there is a lightning bolt symbol to denote electric type. These might seem a little alien at first but after a short amount of time you'll quickly be able to identify the different types by symbol alone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These type symbols are used in other areas of the Pokémon card to signify:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The type of energy cards you need to perform an attack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What typing the Pokémon is weak against&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What type the Pokémon is strong against&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The type of energy cards needed to retreat the Pokémon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3PEa5Xqi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ic4v64ymmx5ujj1w6rbi.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3PEa5Xqi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ic4v64ymmx5ujj1w6rbi.png" alt="Icon Type - Pikachu Card" width="880" height="440"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colors and symbols are both used to denote type and you can see color alone isn't used to convey meaning. This is particularly helpful if someone is color blind and isn't able to make out the difference between green and red or blue and green. The fallback becomes the icon which is easily recognizable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lesson here is not to rely on color alone to convey meaning. You don't know who will be interacting with your designs. Add iconography or easily recognizable symbols in addition to color to add more context and convey meaning to elements.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-use-texture-to-add-more-visual-interest"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3 Use Texture To Add More Visual Interest
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be easy to just add a block of color to the background of these cards and call it a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, that's not the case here. A texture is created on each type of card by incorporating similar or complimentary colors into the background with brush strokes or patterns. This effectively adds more depth and visual interest to the design of each card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the screenshot below, the use of texture doesn't overpower the design. It has some visual interest but doesn't affect your ability to read the text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cmm9cYM8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nzwfcfvuaduqt93hm2xh.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cmm9cYM8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nzwfcfvuaduqt93hm2xh.png" alt="Texture - Dratini Card" width="880" height="440"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is something you can learn from and apply to your own designs: consider a subtle texture or pattern to break up a blank background but don't allow it to distract from the main content.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-use-font-size-to-create-visual-hierarchy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4 Use Font Size To Create Visual Hierarchy
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A visual hierarchy is created when you use different text to denote the importance of the content. This includes the size and weight of text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wNo98eMM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cc56xj0zv4jm09kcuz3w.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wNo98eMM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cc56xj0zv4jm09kcuz3w.png" alt="Hierarchy - Rhydon Card" width="880" height="440"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the Pokémon's name is most important so it's placed at the top and in the largest, boldest font. This immediately draws your eyes to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next most important piece of content is the Pokémon's HP. This is found next to the name and in slightly smaller slightly less bold text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As your eye moves down the card, the next most striking content is the move set and associated attack damage. These components are written in smaller text than the Pokémon name and HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This continues throughout the card so by the end you have all of the information you need and you've read it in logical order. This pattern makes it easy to find the most important information and allows for a quick scan of the card to find what you're looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pokémon cards are an excellent example of visual hierarchy so they're an excellent resource to learn from on this subject!&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-iconography-can-be-an-effective-way-to-simplify-content"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5 Iconography Can Be An Effective Way To Simplify Content
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We mentioned iconography when talking about Pokémon Type in the Color section but it's worth expanding on here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To recap what we already discussed, different icons are used to represent typing e.g. Water, Fire, Grass. Each Pokémon is a specific type and can have various strengths and weaknesses to other Pokémon types. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The type iconography is well-designed and simple. It's instantly recognizable as an advanced player but easy to learn as a new player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It uses color to add to the meaning but take away the coloring and you can still recognize what each icon means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KBI4Cle4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mz3xgwuic21qbeyxejvq.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KBI4Cle4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mz3xgwuic21qbeyxejvq.png" alt="Iconography - Energy Cards" width="880" height="440"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to type iconography, there are also icons that denote the rarity of the card and the set the card belongs to. Let's briefly look at each of these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pokémon card rarity is used to denote the value of a card. There's a lot more to determining the actual value of a card but for the sake of keeping things light, let's just leave it at that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 3 main types of rarity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Common - represented by a circle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uncommon - represented by a diamond&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rare - represented by a star&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I like about this approach is the more sides the shape has, the rarer the card. It's an easy system to remember and instantly recognizable when scanning a card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can learn more about card rarity here: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cardmavin.com/pokemon/pokemon-card-rarity"&gt;Pokémon Card Rarity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pokémon card set symbols deserve an article on their own but for the interest of this article, these symbols denote the set cards belong to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is used to help players identify which cards can be used in competitive play and which cards are no longer in use competitively. It's also another way to determine the value of the card as very old card sets can be worth a lot of money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find out a lot more about set symbols here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cardmavin.com/pokemon/pokemon-card-set-symbols"&gt;Pokémon Card Set Symbols&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big lesson here is that iconography, when used effectively, can be a great way to simplify content.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-quality-is-important"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6 Quality Is Important
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The perceived quality of something will affect how people see it, how they feel about it, and how they enjoy it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is no one tangible thing I can point to here to give you an example of quality I will say, it's about the design as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the points we talked about are used effectively here to add to the quality of the design of these cards. The use of color, iconography, typography, alignment, whitespace all combine to create a visually pleasing design that's easy to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Lug3QGcq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4hb7s5xsedubzt4hjgq8.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Lug3QGcq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4hb7s5xsedubzt4hjgq8.png" alt="Quality - Pokémon Cards" width="880" height="440"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Side note: We could start talking about the impact of nostalgia and collectibles and how that affects things but let's stick purely with the design aesthetics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider this: how you make use of design techniques will affect the quality of your design. Use them well and you'll create an aesthetically pleasing design that works well. Use them incorrectly or not at all, and you'll lose your audience.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-key-take-aways"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My Key Take Aways
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see from this list, there are lots of things you can learn about design from Pokémon cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, I hope this opens your mind up to the possibility of learning about design from other areas outside of traditional mediums like websites, mockups, tutorials etc. Design is everywhere, you just need to stop and take notice of it to learn from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you learned something from this article and it inspires you to delve into the world of Pokémon cards or even consider other places you can learn about design.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#background"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Background
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenya Power(KPLC) is the main power distributor and retails electricity to customers throughout Kenya.&lt;br&gt;
KPLC posts daily planned outages on their official care account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KenyaPower_Care"&gt;KenyaPowerCare&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LmDKY-c3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4zf5lc7lq8lev3jhveju.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LmDKY-c3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4zf5lc7lq8lev3jhveju.png" alt="KPLC scheduled power interruption" title="KPLC scheduled power interruption" width="739" height="592"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The planned interruption schedules are posted in image format and include :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Region&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Area&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Date &amp;amp; Time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Locations within the area&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#purpose-of-the-project"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Purpose of the Project
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main inspirations for this project is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To be able to visualize and understand which parts of the country get more power interruptions than others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To be able to understand trends and patterns which KPLC use for their interruption schedules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To possibly automate the process of notifying citizens (via SMS/Email) about planned outages in there areas as soon as they are posted on the KenyaPowerCare Twitter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#project-outline"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Project Outline
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project is going to be a series and will go from scraping the planned interruption images from Twitter to analyzing and visualizing this data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AxlHQeco--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/glxon5adjp2pv1br3x7j.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AxlHQeco--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/glxon5adjp2pv1br3x7j.png" alt="project flow diagram" title="Project flow" width="607" height="556"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The steps I am going to take to achieve all this include;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scraping the images from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KenyaPower_Care"&gt;KenyaPowerCare&lt;/a&gt; using this Twitter Image Downloader I built &lt;a href="https://github.com/Kimkykie/twitter-image-downloader"&gt;Twitter Image Downloader&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extract Text from the images and converting them to txt file using &lt;a href="https://tesseract.projectnaptha.com/"&gt;Tesseract.js&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cleaning, manipulating and analysing the extracted data using &lt;a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/"&gt;Pandas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visualizing the data on a map.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automating the process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next article I am going to take you through the process of building my Twitter Image Downloader.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to enable Right-to-Left (RTL) support using Chakra UI</title>
      <author>Esther Agbaje</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 10:07:29 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/estheragbaje/how-to-enable-right-to-left-rtl-support-using-chakra-ui-2apj</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/estheragbaje/how-to-enable-right-to-left-rtl-support-using-chakra-ui-2apj</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;RTL support is a means of building your website or app in a way that is responsive to the RTL text direction.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;English and many other languages are written LTR but there are quite a number of languages that go from RTL such as Arabic, Hebrew and a few more.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I'll show you how to create this card component using Chakra UI as well as enable RTL support:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AiMSzLUa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/14in1x0w8rgxzbzmq4w8.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AiMSzLUa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/14in1x0w8rgxzbzmq4w8.gif" alt="Right to left support" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#importance-of-rtl"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Importance of RTL&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helps you reach a wider audience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boosts customer interactions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve conversions &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chakra UI supports RTL languages across all components using RTL-aware style props.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For ease of understanding, &lt;strong&gt;let's divide this post into 2 parts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building the UI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enabling RTL support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#part-1-building-the-ui"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Part 1: Building the UI
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll start off by using &lt;a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/chakra-ui-javascript-lzzg9"&gt;Chakra’s JavaScript code sandbox template&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1:&lt;/strong&gt; First, let’s buildout the content area using &lt;code&gt;HStack&lt;/code&gt; to horizontally layout the &lt;code&gt;Avatar&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Heading&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Tag&lt;/code&gt;  components in &lt;code&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ChakraProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HStack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Avatar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Tag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Heading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@chakra-ui/react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;ChakraProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;HStack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Avatar&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Jill Vince"&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="na"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1508214751196-bcfd4ca60f91?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;w=1170&amp;amp;q=80"&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Heading&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;fontSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"xl"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Jill Vince&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Heading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Tag&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"sm"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;variant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"solid"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;colorScheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"teal"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              Developer
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Tag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;HStack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;       
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;ChakraProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Step2:&lt;/strong&gt; Now, add in the &lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt; component just below &lt;code&gt;HStack&lt;/code&gt;. Then, wrap &lt;code&gt;HStack&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt; within a &lt;code&gt;Box&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At this point, you should have something like this 👇 👇 👇&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UOO98NeX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ii3n8grfsal1056dxt8g.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UOO98NeX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ii3n8grfsal1056dxt8g.png" alt="Card component" width="880" height="254"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Next, it's time to add some more styles to the &lt;code&gt;Box&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;a href="https://chakra-ui.com/docs/features/style-props"&gt;style props&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ChakraProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HStack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Avatar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Tag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Heading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@chakra-ui/react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Box&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;paddingY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"8"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;bg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"white"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"md"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;borderStartWidth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"5px"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;borderStartColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"teal"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;paddingStart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"8"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;paddingEnd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"6"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;HStack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Avatar&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Jill Vince"&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1508214751196-bcfd4ca60f91?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;w=1170&amp;amp;q=80"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Heading&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;fontSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"xl"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Jill Vince&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Heading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Tag&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"sm"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;variant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"solid"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;colorScheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"teal"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      Developer
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Tag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;HStack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and 
    typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's 
    standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown 
    printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a 
    type specimen book.
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice we're using the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Logical_Properties"&gt;CSS Logical properties&lt;/a&gt; instead of the physical properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;code&gt;borderStartWidth&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;borderLeftWidth&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;borderStartColor&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;borderLeftColor&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;paddingStart&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;paddingLeft&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;paddingEnd&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;paddingRight&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Physical properties like &lt;code&gt;left&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;right&lt;/code&gt; don't automatically adjust in RTL layout. This is where logical properties come- they make the layout automatically flip from RTL to LTR and back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4:&lt;/strong&gt; Let's add the star icon at the top right. Chakra provides a set of commonly used interface icons you can use in your project, called &lt;a href="https://chakra-ui.com/docs/media-and-icons/icon#using-chakra-ui-icons"&gt;Chakra icons&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
We'd use the &lt;code&gt;StarIcon&lt;/code&gt; and import it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chakra Icons is a dependency so you'd need to install it if you're using it. Alternatively, you can use a &lt;a href="https://chakra-ui.com/docs/media-and-icons/icon#using-a-third-party-icon-library"&gt;third-party icon library&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ChakraProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HStack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Avatar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Tag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Heading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@chakra-ui/react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;StarIcon&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@chakra-ui/icons&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;ChakraProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our &lt;code&gt;Card&lt;/code&gt; component is looking good! You're doing amazing and only a few steps are left!&lt;/em&gt; 😉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#learn-how-to-truncate-text-using-chakra-ui"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://dev.to/estheragbaje/how-to-truncate-text-using-chakra-ui-4mpj"&gt;Learn how to truncate text using Chakra UI&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Step 5:&lt;/strong&gt; Position the &lt;code&gt;StarIcon&lt;/code&gt; relative to the parent &lt;code&gt;Box&lt;/code&gt;. To do this, we'd need to assign position &lt;code&gt;relative&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;Box&lt;/code&gt; and position &lt;code&gt;absolute&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;StarIcon&lt;/code&gt;. Next, go ahead to add in the remaining styles for the icon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you should have something like this 👇 👇 👇&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MtvtIxo8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hzpiyun1tgwcb9hibres.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MtvtIxo8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hzpiyun1tgwcb9hibres.png" alt="Card component" width="880" height="310"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, you'll notice two things from our card. The first thing is, the card is too close to the edge of the screen and needs a bit of padding. The second, there needs to be a parent container with a gray color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Step 6:&lt;/strong&gt; Add a parent &lt;code&gt;Box&lt;/code&gt; to wrap the entire component and style it like this: &lt;code&gt;padding="4"&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;bg="gray.100"&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BlD-YkgF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dzpkp9mmmvrnqfegu0q3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BlD-YkgF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dzpkp9mmmvrnqfegu0q3.png" alt="Card component" width="880" height="315"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-final-ui-code-is"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The final UI code is:
&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ChakraProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HStack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Avatar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Switch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Tag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Heading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@chakra-ui/react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;StarIcon&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@chakra-ui/icons&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;ChakraProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Box&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"4"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;bg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"gray.100"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Box&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"relative"&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;paddingY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"8"&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;bg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"white"&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"md"&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;borderStartWidth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"5px"&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;borderStartColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"teal"&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;paddingStart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"8"&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;paddingEnd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"6"&lt;/span&gt;

            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;ChakraProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#part-2-enabling-rtl-support"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Part 2: Enabling RTL support
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we've built out this UI, it's  time to add RTL support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1:&lt;/strong&gt; First, we import &lt;code&gt;extendTheme&lt;/code&gt; function from "@chakra-ui/react". You'd need this to add direction key to the theme.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;extendTheme&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@chakra-ui/react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Next, create a slice of state to keep track of the RTL and LTR states.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setDir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;ltr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We also need to set the direction prop, &lt;code&gt;dir&lt;/code&gt; and set it to this &lt;code&gt;dir&lt;/code&gt; state on the &lt;code&gt;Box&lt;/code&gt; component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Next, we go to ChakraProvider and add a &lt;code&gt;direction&lt;/code&gt; key to the theme using the &lt;code&gt;extendTheme&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;ChakraProvider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;extendTheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;direction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dir&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
...
&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;ChakraProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4:&lt;/strong&gt; Since we'll be switching between LTR and RTL layouts, we need build out a switch that toggles this state and gives the right layout accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll do this using the &lt;code&gt;Switch&lt;/code&gt; component and assign an onChange handler to it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Switch&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;onChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setDir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;checked&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;rtl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;ltr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 5:&lt;/strong&gt; Finally, to beautify this &lt;code&gt;Switch&lt;/code&gt;, let's center it and add LTR and RTL labels.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Center&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;mt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"4"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;HStack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;LTR&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Switch&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;onChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setDir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;checked&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;rtl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 
        &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;ltr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;RTL&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;HStack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The final code snippet with RTL support enabled will look like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>WordPress - Minify CSS, HTML, JS files using PHP</title>
      <author>Deepak Singh</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 09:55:46 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/techmesh/wordpress-minify-css-html-js-files-using-php-2pb9</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/techmesh/wordpress-minify-css-html-js-files-using-php-2pb9</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As web developers or designers, we all have an enemy which is called Site Speed. There are so many ways to speed up your web page, we are going to discuss one of those ways. Minifying HTML, CSS &amp;amp; JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minifying means removing redundant or unnecessary data such as spacing, well-named variables, and comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minified version of the code [HTML, CSS, JavaScript] is 48% smaller in general. In some cases, minification can reduce the file size by as much as 60%. For example, there's a 176 kb difference between the original and minified version of the jQuery/JavaScript library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It reduces web page load times and bandwidth usage on websites and improves website speed and accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we are going to minify WordPress using a simple PHP function. Add below codes to your functions.php, if your are using child theme add in side child-theme/functions.php.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step One Create a Class:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;class WP_HTML_Compression{
    protected $wp_compress_css = true;
    protected $wp_compress_js = true;
    protected $wp_info_comment = true;
    protected $wp_remove_comments = true;
    protected $html;
    public function __construct($html)
    {
        if (!empty($html)) {
            $this-&amp;gt;wp_parseHTML($html);
        }
    }
    public function __toString()
    {
        return $this-&amp;gt;html;
    }
    protected function wp_bottomComment($raw, $compressed)
    {
        $raw = strlen($raw);
        $compressed = strlen($compressed);
        $savings = ($raw - $compressed) / $raw * 100;
        $savings = round($savings, 2);
        return '&amp;lt;!--HTML compressed, size saved ' . $savings . '%. From ' . $raw . ' bytes, now ' . $compressed . ' bytes--&amp;gt;';
    }
    protected function wp_minifyHTML($html)
    {
        $pattern = '/&amp;lt;(?&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;script).*?&amp;lt;\/script\s*&amp;gt;|&amp;lt;(?&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;style).*?&amp;lt;\/style\s*&amp;gt;|&amp;lt;!(?&amp;lt;comment&amp;gt;--).*?--&amp;gt;|&amp;lt;(?&amp;lt;tag&amp;gt;[\/\w.:-]*)(?:".*?"|\'.*?\'|[^\'"&amp;gt;]+)*&amp;gt;|(?&amp;lt;text&amp;gt;((&amp;lt;[^!\/\w.:-])?[^&amp;lt;]*)+)|/si';
        preg_match_all($pattern, $html, $matches, PREG_SET_ORDER);
        $overriding = false;
        $raw_tag = false;
        $html = '';
        foreach ($matches as $token) {
            $tag = (isset($token['tag'])) ? strtolower($token['tag']) : null;
            $content = $token[0];
            if (is_null($tag)) {
                if (!empty($token['script'])) {
                    $strip = $this-&amp;gt;wp_compress_js;
                } else if (!empty($token['style'])) {
                    $strip = $this-&amp;gt;wp_compress_css;
                } else if ($content == '&amp;lt;!--wp-html-compression no compression--&amp;gt;') {
                    $overriding = !$overriding;
                    continue;
                } else if ($this-&amp;gt;wp_remove_comments) {
                    if (!$overriding &amp;amp;&amp;amp; $raw_tag != 'textarea') {
                        $content = preg_replace('/&amp;lt;!--(?!\s*(?:\[if [^\]]+]|&amp;lt;!|&amp;gt;))(?:(?!--&amp;gt;).)*--&amp;gt;/s', '', $content);
                    }
                }
            } else {
                if ($tag == 'pre' || $tag == 'textarea') {
                    $raw_tag = $tag;
                } else if ($tag == '/pre' || $tag == '/textarea') {
                    $raw_tag = false;
                } else {
                    if ($raw_tag || $overriding) {
                        $strip = false;
                    } else {
                        $strip = true;
                        $content = preg_replace('/(\s+)(\w++(?&amp;lt;!\baction|\balt|\bcontent|\bsrc)="")/', '$1', $content);
                        $content = str_replace(' /&amp;gt;', '/&amp;gt;', $content);
                    }
                }
            }
            if ($strip) {
                $content = $this-&amp;gt;wp_removeWhiteSpace($content);
            }
            $html .= $content;
        }
        return $html;
    }
    public function wp_parseHTML($html)
    {
        $this-&amp;gt;html = $this-&amp;gt;wp_minifyHTML($html);
        if ($this-&amp;gt;wp_info_comment) {
            $this-&amp;gt;html .= "\n" . $this-&amp;gt;wp_bottomComment($html, $this-&amp;gt;html);
        }
    }
    protected function wp_removeWhiteSpace($str)
    {
        $str = str_replace("\t", ' ', $str);
        $str = str_replace("\n",  '', $str);
        $str = str_replace("\r",  '', $str);
        $str = str_replace(" This function requires postMessage and CORS (if the site is cross domain).", '', $str);
        while (stristr($str, '  ')) {
            $str = str_replace('  ', ' ', $str);
        }
        return $str;
    }
 }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Step Two call the functions:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;function wp_html_compression_finish($html)
 {
    return new WP_HTML_Compression($html);
 }
 function wp_wp_html_compression_start()
 {
    ob_start('wp_html_compression_finish');
 }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Final step call Wp hook:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;add_action('get_header', 'wp_wp_html_compression_start');
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All to getherL&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;class WP_HTML_Compression{
    protected $wp_compress_css = true;
    protected $wp_compress_js = true;

    protected $wp_remove_comments = true;
    protected $html;
    public function __construct($html)
    {

            $this-&amp;gt;wp_parseHTML($html);
        }
    }
    public function __toString()

    protected function wp_bottomComment($raw, $compressed)

        $savings = ($raw - $compressed) / $raw * 100;
        $savings = round($savings, 2);
        return '&amp;lt;!--HTML compressed, size saved ' . $savings . '%. From ' . $raw . ' bytes, now ' . $compressed . ' bytes--&amp;gt;';

        preg_match_all($pattern, $html, $matches, PREG_SET_ORDER);
        $overriding = false;
        $raw_tag = false;
        $html = '';

                    }
                }
            } else {

                    }
                }
            }
            if ($strip) {
                $content = $this-&amp;gt;wp_removeWhiteSpace($content);
            }
            $html .= $content;
        }
        return $html;
    }
    public function wp_parseHTML($html)
    {
        $this-&amp;gt;html = $this-&amp;gt;wp_minifyHTML($html);
        if ($this-&amp;gt;wp_info_comment) {

 {
    ob_start('wp_html_compression_finish');
 }
 add_action('get_header', 'wp_wp_html_compression_start');
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br&gt;
Instead of using plugins to minify simply add this function to your WordPress site and see the magic🏃‍♂️.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Day 32 of 100 Days of Code &amp; Scrum: Branching, Merging, and More Physical Therapy</title>
      <author>Rammina</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/rammina/day-32-of-100-days-of-code-scrum-branching-merging-and-more-physical-therapy-4m12</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like every Tuesday, wasn't that productive today because I was impeded by my Physical Therapy session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn't have much time for coding, and the best that I could do where make a desktop breakpoint for my navbar, re-factor my code, and then do a pull request to merge it with my main branch. Next, I have to make a Services section, so I was looking at the websites of web agencies to use as a reference for design. I did not start coding it yet, but I already made another branch for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#yesterday"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Yesterday
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned about &lt;code&gt;react-css-modules&lt;/code&gt; and used it to make it easier to code CSS. Also, I finished the mobile version of my navigation menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#today"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Today
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the things I learned and worked on today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#nextjs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Next.js
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remembered to use &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Image /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; for images in Next.js as it comes with optimization such as lazy loading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also learned that if you want to style &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Link /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; with a className, you can insert &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a className={styles.link}&amp;gt;link text&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; like this:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Link href="/"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;a className={styles.link}&amp;gt;Home&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/Link&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and that you can't do it like this (INVALID):
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Link href="/" className={styles.link}&amp;gt;Home&amp;lt;/Link&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#scrum"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Scrum
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read some horror stories about Scrumbags (really bad Scrum Masters).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I did some practice flashcards for Scrum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reviewed some of the things I've learned before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to make some time for studying Typescript, but maybe tomorrow onwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a good day, everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
