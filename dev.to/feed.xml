      <description>&lt;p&gt;Societies in industrialized countries depend more and more on software. The rising impact of cyber-physical systems on the real world as well as the amount of personally identifiable information collected and processed shows that systems must be secure. This is not easy to achieve due to rising complexity of those systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizations have information security departments that support securing business functions and train employees in a variety of security topics to show how to react on certain events and how to handle classified information. While there are trainings for administrators to show them how to secure a system, often little to none effort is put into teaching software engineers and developers on how to develop a secure software solution. This is quite a big issue I'd like to address and raise awareness about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) created the "&lt;a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-proactive-controls/"&gt;OWASP TOP 10 Proactive Controls project (OPC)&lt;/a&gt;" to encourage developers starting with application security. This blog entry summarizes the content of it and adds hints and information to it too. Please keep in mind that this should only raise awareness and is a starting point to help get deeper into this topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#define-security-requirements"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Define Security Requirements
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security falls under the category non-functional requirements. It should define the needed security functionality the software has to satisfy. To save up time and not re-invent the wheel on each new project, you can select security requirements from a catalog. There is a general one called "&lt;a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/"&gt;Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)&lt;/a&gt;" and one for the mobile named "&lt;a href="https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs"&gt;Mobile Application Verification Standard (MASVS)&lt;/a&gt;". They contain a collection of requirements which are best practices for each listed category. Fortunately they have mapped those requirements with CWE (common weakness enumeration which is basically a list of software and hardware weaknesses). Depending on the used tools, those CWEs can be automatically scanned in your code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#leverage-security-frameworks-and-libraries"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Leverage Security Frameworks and Libraries
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally third-party libraries/frameworks are included into the project to re-use already written code. You should only use those from trusted sources, which are actively maintained and used by many applications. Keep them up to date and encapsulate the library, so you only expose the required need into your software. There are quite some dependency checkers out there to help you select dependencies and keep them up to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#secure-database-access"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Secure Database Access
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has some subitems, but we'll go through them quite quickly. Secure your queries. We all know those funny SQL injection jokes, but you can solve this problem quite easily with query parameterization. You can find a cheat sheet from OWASP &lt;a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Query_Parameterization_Cheat_Sheet.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and another one from Bobby Tables &lt;a href="https://bobby-tables.com/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Database management systems are not always "secure by default" configured. There are guidelines and benchmarks available out there which you should check out like &lt;a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Access to the database should be properly authenticated. This should take place over a secure channel, and your credentials should be properly secured. Besides authenticating with credentials, you should also check out if it's possible to access it instead with your managed identity.&lt;br&gt;
The last point is secure communication. Encrypting your data in transit by having a end-to-end communication security when sensitive data is transmitted over any network. This can be done via TLS. There are guides there helping you choose the minimum allowed TLS version and choosing a cipher suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#encode-and-escape-data"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Encode And Escape Data
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here we reach injection attacks again. By encoding characters we ensure that special characters are not processed for malicious intends. This means that the content will be displayed but not executed. For example, instead of sending &lt;code&gt;"&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;"&lt;/code&gt; we encode special characters inputted by the user and send &lt;code&gt;"&amp;amp;lt;script&amp;amp;gt;"&lt;/code&gt; which will be displayed on the browser like &lt;code&gt;"&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;"&lt;/code&gt; but will not be executed. This output encoding should be applied before the content is passed to the target interpreter, to defend against XSS. There are some examples for &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/cross-site-scripting"&gt;C#&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-java-encoder/"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/zendframework/zend-escaper"&gt;PHP&lt;/a&gt;. There are also other types of encoding and injection defenses like "shell escaping" for os command input. Forms of escaping are not limited to those examples listed here. Look for guidelines and best practices when using user input for certain operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#validate-all-inputs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Validate All Inputs
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might have already noticed that you can't trust input from clients which means that the data has to be validated before usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0nXtL0EI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nux3sea4j58pmp9lue9g.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0nXtL0EI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nux3sea4j58pmp9lue9g.png" alt="Exploits of a Mom" width="666" height="205"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data should be checked that its syntax and semantic is valid. &lt;br&gt;
Syntax validity ensures that data are in a expected form and should not allow any deviations. If three digits are expected, it should be checked that the input consists only of digits and has three digits in length.&lt;br&gt;
Semantic validity accepts input only in an acceptable range specified by the applications functionality and its context. For example a start date has to be before an end date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those validations can be performed both on the client and server side, but security related validations always have to be done on the server side, since the validation on client side can be bypassed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are in general two approaches for syntax validation: blacklisting and whitelisting. While blacklisting blocks exact texts (e.g. &lt;code&gt;"&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;"&lt;/code&gt;) to prevent injections, is whitelisting checking for data set matches. In general it is recommended to use whitelisting on a minimal approach, instead of blacklisting since it is prone to bypasses. In other words, whitelisting limits attack surface, while blacklisting detects and stops obvious attacks.&lt;br&gt;
Bear in mind that those validations have limits. Since complexity allows more variations and posibilities, valid data cann still be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to check whether data matches a specific pattern is the usage of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression"&gt;regular expressions&lt;/a&gt;. This should be used with caution since expressions can get quite complex as well as hard to maintain. It also enables a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReDoS"&gt;regular expression denial of service attack&lt;/a&gt; (ReDOS) which produces a denial of service due to the exploitation of the exponential time worst-case scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty validation libraries that can be leveraged to validate data. PHP has &lt;a href="https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_ref_filter.asp"&gt;filter functions&lt;/a&gt;, and Java has the &lt;a href="https://hibernate.org/validator/"&gt;Hibernate Validator&lt;/a&gt; and C# the &lt;a href="https://github.com/FluentValidation/FluentValidation"&gt;FluentValidation&lt;/a&gt;. You can also sanitize your data to erase not needed data in your input. Please keep in mind that input validation should not be your primary method to prevent injections and other attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another problem you might encounter is the validation of serialized data. &lt;a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A8_2017-Insecure_Deserialization"&gt;Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources&lt;/a&gt;. If this is not possible, you might want to implement integrity checks or encryption to prevent tampering. Enforce strict type constraints and possibly run code in a low privilege environment like in a temporary container to deserialize data. Log exceptions and failures such as the not expecting  incoming type or failure in deserialization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from serialized data, there is also the problem with autobinding. Some frameworks support automatic binding of HTTP request parameters to server-side objects consumed by the application. Those bindings enable an attack vector to exploit a vulnerability called "Mass assignment". For example the user can set a parameter like "isAdmin" to true to elevate privileges. There are two ways to handle this, by either avoid autobinding and use Data Transfer Objects (TDOs) which are basically POCOs, or setup whitelist rules to define which fields are allowed to be auto-bound. There is a cheat sheet by OWASP you might to check out &lt;a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Mass_Assignment_Cheat_Sheet.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to get more information on how to resolve this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#enforce-access-controls"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Enforce Access Controls
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Access Controls manages the access to systems as well as resources and ensures that only authorized users/systems have access. It should be forced that all requests go through the access control to ensure that every request is checked and authorized to pass. You may already come across of the terms privilege, right and permission. Those are not interchangeable terms! For more information, read Wentz Wus &lt;a href="https://wentzwu.com/2020/07/21/privileges-rights-permissions/"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This topic should be thoroughly designed up front and taken early into account in the designing phase.&lt;br&gt;
There are different types of access controls that should be considered (but not limited to):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discretionary_access_control"&gt;Discretionary Access Control&lt;/a&gt; (DAC): lets people manage content by their own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_access_control"&gt;Mandatory Access Control&lt;/a&gt; (MAC): restricts access based on sensitivity (by a label) of the information and the authorization of the user to access such sensitivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control"&gt;Role Based Access Control&lt;/a&gt; (RBAC): controls access to resources based on defined rules. Performed actions are identified with roles rather than with individual subject identities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute-based_access_control"&gt;Attribute Based Access Control&lt;/a&gt; (ABAC) manages the request based on policies which combines attributes of the user and object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two principles that you should embed when using access controls. The first is deny by default. This means that if a request is not specifically allowed it must be denied. The second is the principle of least privilege. Ensure that only the least and only necessary access is possible. Often when time passes, it can happen that &lt;a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/privilege-creep"&gt;privilege creep&lt;/a&gt; occurs. This means that an identity accumulated access rights and has higher privileges than necessary, so keep that in mind and check regularly if certain permissions and rights are needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linked to a granular access control is the programmed check of permissions. Many applications use access controls that are role based. This limits the developers and adds dangers to it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;hasRole&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"SuperUser"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;hasRole&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Admin"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;doAction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead your should implement rights and check for them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;hasRight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"RightX"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;doAction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With this, you don't need to re-deploy everything if new roles are added that should have the privilege to perform actions and it is easier to maintain. It also enables for a more granular access control which helps administrators to configure the system more securely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, you should ensure that all access control failures should be logged to ensure &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-repudiation"&gt;non-repudiation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#data-protection"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Data Protection
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data can contain sensitive information which requires more protection, since it may fall under laws and regulations. It is important to classify data in your system to determine sensitivity. Depending on those classifications it may also add security requirements to the system/infrastructure that collects, processes or stores this data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data can be in three states. At rest, in transit or in use. Depending on the classification you have to secure the data in each state to avoid information disclosure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Application secrets should never be stored in code, configs or other files. Keep them in a secret vault like Azure KeyVault or Amazon KMS. Besides security this also gives more flexibility on configuring your solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to add here to also think about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_retention"&gt;data retention&lt;/a&gt; as well as backup strategies. For data retention you have to keep laws and regulations in mind. Consult with a specialist or lawyer to know what the requirements are. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backup strategies should not only be planned and executed, but also the results tested. There is a saying that you do not have a backup when you did not test it. In the end, you do not want to be on several tech blogs because of some &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/01/gitlab-suffers-major-backup-failure-after-data-deletion-incident/"&gt;deletion incident and backup failure like GitLab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#implement-security-logging-and-monitoring"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Implement Security Logging and Monitoring
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of Security logging is to log security information during runtime. It can be used for forensic analysis and investigations, as well as satisfying regulatory compliance requests. Monitoring is the live review of logs using various forms of automation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logging solutions must be designed, build and managed in a secure way. Encode and validate dangerous characters before logging to prevent &lt;a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Log_Injection"&gt;injections or forging attacks&lt;/a&gt;. Ensure log integrity to protect against tampering. When logging, remove any sensitive information to avoid information disclosure. There should also be a common logging format to be consistent. Keep also an eye on time syncing across systems to have consistent timestamps in your logs. Furthermore, you should forward logs to a central, secure logging service to allow centralized monitoring and securing log data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To identify potentially malicious activties, following activies can be logged as high severity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Submitted data that is outside of an expected range&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Submitted data that contains changes that should not be modifiable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requests violating access control rules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a more comprehensive list, check out OWASPs AppSensor Detection_points tab here.&lt;br&gt;
When encountering those activties, the application should respond to possible attacks and shut them down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a small cheat sheet related to application security logging here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#handle-all-errors-and-exceptions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Handle all Errors and Exceptions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exceptions can happen in various ways and should be handled accordingly. This handling occurs in all areas of the application including business logic and security features. It is also important for intrusion detection. Certain attacks against the application may trigger errors which can help detect attacks in progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manage exceptions in a centralized manner to avoid duplicated try/catch blocks and ensure all unexpected behavior is correctly handled. When displaying the error message to the user, be sure that you do not leak any critical information but still provide enough information to respond properly.&lt;br&gt;
When logging error messages, provide enough information so that the support, forensics and incident response teams understand the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help discover possible failures early, you can also use Netflix's &lt;a href="https://github.com/netflix/chaosmonkey"&gt;Chaos Monkey&lt;/a&gt;. It randomly terminates VMs and containers to show how resilient your services are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#some-more-information"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Some more Information
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#code-review"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Code Review
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the mentioned areas, you should also have a look at OWASP's &lt;a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-code-review-guide/"&gt;Code Review Guide&lt;/a&gt;. It is quite comprehensive but also raises awareness on different topics, containing code examples and figures to illustrate in an easy way to show what has to be considered when reviewing code besides clean code practices and business logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#do-not-write-your-own-encryption"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Do not write your own encryption
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some developers are tempted to rollout their own encryption. &lt;a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2011/04/schneiers_law.html"&gt;Schneir's Law&lt;/a&gt; states&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone, from the most clueless amateur to the best cryptographer, can create an algorithm that he himself can't break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since those persons believe that they can not break their cipher, they use it as evidence that it is unbreakable. This is a good example of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect"&gt;Dunning-Kruger effect&lt;/a&gt;. There is a &lt;a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/43272/why-is-writing-your-own-encryption-discouraged"&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; on why it is discouraged to write your own encryption on Stack Exchange.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore use existing solutions that are recognized by the industry and follow their best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Roadmap 2022 : from a beginner to advanced developer</title>
      <author>Rawan Amr Abdulsattar</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 11:38:49 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/rawan_amr_abdulsattar/my-roadmap-2022-from-a-beginner-to-advanced-developer-1cp4</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/rawan_amr_abdulsattar/my-roadmap-2022-from-a-beginner-to-advanced-developer-1cp4</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the end of &lt;strong&gt;2021&lt;/strong&gt; I found myself a programmer who only knows about some programming languages and some frameworks but with no real programming experience,no projects and no achievements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why ?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was because I didn't start with the &lt;strong&gt;fundamentals&lt;/strong&gt;, I didn't learn about algorithms, data structures or anything important as Big O.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-decision"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My Decision
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to start from the beginning as if I learnt nothing before, and then wrote my goals of 2022, &lt;strong&gt;a modified roadmap every beginner should use.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Roadmap 2022:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-introduction-to-programming"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1- Introduction to programming:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--586swKkh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/27fm0ravp7i1pmwjzi4i.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--586swKkh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/27fm0ravp7i1pmwjzi4i.jpg" alt="Image description" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Programming is writing computer code to create a program, to solve a problem. Programs are created to implement algorithms . Algorithms can be represented as pseudocode or a flowchart , and programming is the translation of these into a computer program.&lt;br&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  2-Algorithms and data structures
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SST-1-rv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/w00hhh69j0sbv5ravlhp.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SST-1-rv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/w00hhh69j0sbv5ravlhp.jpeg" alt="Image description" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A data structure is a named location that can be used to store and organize data. And, an algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem. Learning data structures and algorithms allow us to write efficient and optimized computer programs.&lt;br&gt;

CS50 is an on-campus and online introductory course on computer science taught at Harvard University and Yale University. In 2016, CS50 became available to high school students as an Advanced Placement Computer Science course&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Important lectures in my opinion are :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

Flutter is a cross-platform software development framework that was presented by Google in 2015 and received its first release in May of 2017. Flutter nowadays has steadily grown and provided possibilities not only for iOS and Android mobile development but also for web and desktop applications as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Create Image slider using Js and CSS</title>
      <author>anomaly3108</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 11:25:25 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/anomaly3108/create-image-slider-using-js-and-css-48l3</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/anomaly3108/create-image-slider-using-js-and-css-48l3</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article, we are going to make an Image Slider with a clean UI and smooth transition. First, Let's see what are we building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#preview"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  PREVIEW
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1VPCyh4n--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lkchj8pzdo19yd1sqmz2.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1VPCyh4n--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lkchj8pzdo19yd1sqmz2.gif" alt="Image description" width="575" height="402"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#html"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  HTML
&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div class="container"&amp;gt;
     &amp;lt;div class="img-comp-container"&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;div class="img-comp-img"&amp;gt;
               &amp;lt;img src="a.png" height="400" width="300"&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;div class="img-comp-img img-comp-overlay"&amp;gt;
               &amp;lt;img src="b.png" height="400" width="300"&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
     &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We will have an outer div with class &lt;code&gt;.img-comp-container&lt;/code&gt;. It will have two separate children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;.img-comp-img&lt;/code&gt;: It will contain the first image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;.img-comp-overlay&lt;/code&gt;: It will contain the second image for overlay. This image will be overlayed over the top of first image to create the effect of sliding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess now you have an overview of what are we doing. Now let's get into the CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#css"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  CSS
&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

.img-comp-container {
    position: relative;
    height: 500px;
}

.img-comp-img {
    position: absolute;
    width: auto;
    height: auto;
    overflow: hidden;
}

.img-comp-img img {
    padding: 20px;
    display: table-row;
}
.container {
    display: table;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This CSS is for the image that will be displayed on the screen.&lt;br&gt;
Everything above is self-explanatory but If you have any queries then comment down.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;.img-comp-slider {
    position: absolute;
    z-index: 9;
    cursor: ew-resize;
    /*set the appearance of the slider:*/
    width: 40px;
    height: 40px;
    background: url(slider_icon.jpg);
    background-color: #ffffff70;
    background-repeat: round;
    backdrop-filter: blur(5px);
    border-radius: 50%;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;this CSS is for the slider button &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#javascript"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Javascript
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the fun begins. Let's see from the scratch.&lt;br&gt;
First, we need to find all elements with an "overlay" (&lt;code&gt;img-comp-overlay&lt;/code&gt;) class&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;var x, i;
    /*find all elements with an "overlay" class:*/
    x = document.getElementsByClassName("img-comp-overlay");
    for (i = 0; i &amp;lt; x.length; i++) {
        /*once for each "overlay" element:
        pass the "overlay" element as a parameter when executing the compareImages function:*/
        compareImages(x[i]);
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, we will create a function &lt;code&gt;compareImages&lt;/code&gt; with an &lt;code&gt;img&lt;/code&gt; parameter&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;function compareImages(img) {
   var slider, img, clicked = 0, w, h;
   /*get the width and height of the img element*/
   w = img.offsetWidth;
   h = img.offsetHeight;
   /*set the width of the img element to 50%:*/
   img.style.width = (w / 2) + "px";
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, We will create the slider using Js in the same function&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;/*create slider:*/
slider = document.createElement("DIV");
slider.setAttribute("class", "img-comp-slider");
/*insert slider*/
img.parentElement.insertBefore(slider, img);
position the slider in the middle:*/
slider.style.top = (h / 2) - (slider.offsetHeight / 2) + "px";
slider.style.left = (w / 2) - (slider.offsetWidth / 2) + "px";
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, Let us add the listeners that will be triggered when we press the mouse button.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;/*execute a function when the mouse button is pressed:*/
slider.addEventListener("mousedown", slideReady);
/*and another function when the mouse button is released:*/
window.addEventListener("mouseup", slideFinish);    
/*or touched (for touch screens:*/
slider.addEventListener("touchstart", slideReady);
/*and released (for touch screens:*/
window.addEventListener("touchstop", slideFinish);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, Basic structure of our slider is created. Next we need to create some functions that will perform the main functionality of the slider. i.e, Slide over the the image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this we will first create &lt;code&gt;slideReady&lt;/code&gt; Function inside the &lt;code&gt;compareImages&lt;/code&gt; Function that will be executed when mouse button is pressed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;function slideReady(e) {
    /*prevent any other actions that may occur when moving over the image:*/
    e.preventDefault();
    /*the slider is now clicked and ready to move:*/
    clicked = 1;
    /*execute a function when the slider is moved:*/
    window.addEventListener("mousemove", slideMove);
    window.addEventListener("touchmove", slideMove);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, create another Function inside the &lt;code&gt;compareImages&lt;/code&gt; Function when the slider is no longer clicked&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;function slideFinish() {
    /*the slider is no longer clicked:*/
    clicked = 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, we will create 3 more functions in &lt;code&gt;compareImages&lt;/code&gt; with which we will get the cursor position and move the slider accordingly across the Image window&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;function slideMove(e) {
    var pos;
    /*if the slider is no longer clicked, exit this function:*/
    if (clicked == 0) return false;
    /*get the cursor's x position:*/
    pos = getCursorPos(e)
        /*prevent the slider from being positioned outside the image:*/
    if (pos &amp;lt; 0) pos = 0;
    if (pos &amp;gt; w) pos = w;
    /*execute a function that will resize the overlay image according to the cursor:*/
    slide(pos);
}

function getCursorPos(e) {
    var a, x = 0;
    e = e || window.event;
    /*get the x positions of the image:*/
    a = img.getBoundingClientRect();
    /*calculate the cursor's x coordinate, relative to the image:*/
    x = e.pageX - a.left;
    /*consider any page scrolling:*/
    x = x - window.pageXOffset;
    return x;
}

function slide(x) {
    /*resize the image:*/
    img.style.width = x + "px";
    /*position the slider:*/
    slider.style.left = img.offsetWidth - (slider.offsetWidth / 2) + "px";
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wrap it all in a parent function with name &lt;code&gt;initComparisons&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Now we have covered all the aspects of this now let's see the full  &lt;code&gt;Scripts.js&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;function initComparisons() {
    var x, i;
    /*find all elements with an "overlay" class:*/
    x = document.getElementsByClassName("img-comp-overlay");
    for (i = 0; i &amp;lt; x.length; i++) {
        /*once for each "overlay" element:
        pass the "overlay" element as a parameter when executing the compareImages function:*/
        compareImages(x[i]);
    }

    function compareImages(img) {
        var slider, img, clicked = 0,
            w, h;
        /*get the width and height of the img element*/
        w = img.offsetWidth;
        h = img.offsetHeight;
        /*set the width of the img element to 50%:*/
        img.style.width = (w / 2) + "px";
        /*create slider:*/
        slider = document.createElement("DIV");
        slider.setAttribute("class", "img-comp-slider");
        /*insert slider*/
        img.parentElement.insertBefore(slider, img);
        /*position the slider in the middle:*/
        slider.style.top = (h / 2) - (slider.offsetHeight / 2) + "px";
        slider.style.left = (w / 2) - (slider.offsetWidth / 2) + "px";
        /*execute a function when the mouse button is pressed:*/
        slider.addEventListener("mousedown", slideReady);
        /*and another function when the mouse button is released:*/
        window.addEventListener("mouseup", slideFinish);
        /*or touched (for touch screens:*/
        slider.addEventListener("touchstart", slideReady);
        /*and released (for touch screens:*/
        window.addEventListener("touchstop", slideFinish);

        function slideReady(e) {
            /*prevent any other actions that may occur when moving over the image:*/
            e.preventDefault();
            /*the slider is now clicked and ready to move:*/
            clicked = 1;
            /*execute a function when the slider is moved:*/
            window.addEventListener("mousemove", slideMove);
            window.addEventListener("touchmove", slideMove);
        }

        function slideFinish() {
            /*the slider is no longer clicked:*/
            clicked = 0;
        }

        function slideMove(e) {
            var pos;
            /*if the slider is no longer clicked, exit this function:*/
            if (clicked == 0) return false;
            /*get the cursor's x position:*/
            pos = getCursorPos(e)
                /*prevent the slider from being positioned outside the image:*/
            if (pos &amp;lt; 0) pos = 0;
            if (pos &amp;gt; w) pos = w;
            /*execute a function that will resize the overlay image according to the cursor:*/
            slide(pos);
        }

        function getCursorPos(e) {
            var a, x = 0;
            e = e || window.event;
            /*get the x positions of the image:*/
            a = img.getBoundingClientRect();
            /*calculate the cursor's x coordinate, relative to the image:*/
            x = e.pageX - a.left;
            /*consider any page scrolling:*/
            x = x - window.pageXOffset;
            return x;
        }

        function slide(x) {
            /*resize the image:*/
            img.style.width = x + "px";
            /*position the slider:*/
            slider.style.left = img.offsetWidth - (slider.offsetWidth / 2) + "px";
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now the final step, use this script in HTML and call the &lt;code&gt;initComparisons&lt;/code&gt; function at the starting of the page where you want the slider.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;
    initComparisons();
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The final product will look like:-&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Yvv3x-Ro--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/044pq2jwhnu83l1lgrwj.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Yvv3x-Ro--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/044pq2jwhnu83l1lgrwj.gif" alt="Image description" width="400" height="540"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#wrapping-up"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Wrapping Up
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed the article, if yes then don't forget to press ❤️. You can also bookmark it for later use. It was fun to make this slider and If you have any queries or suggestions don't hesitate to drop them. See you. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="#dropzonejs-multiupload-with-rename-functionality"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Dropzone.js Multiupload with rename functionality
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#scenrio-user-wants-to-upload-logos-of-tv-channelssports-team-etc-if-he-uploads-one-by-one-it-is-a-hassle"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Scenrio: User wants to upload logos of tv channels/sports team etc, if he uploads one by one it is a hassle.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rough design, how UI might look(How I intially imagined it to be)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--z2FA-uSH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sahilkashyap64/dropzone-sortablejs-multiupload-rename/master/img/UI%2520formultiupload%2520and%2520rename.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--z2FA-uSH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sahilkashyap64/dropzone-sortablejs-multiupload-rename/master/img/UI%2520formultiupload%2520and%2520rename.png" alt="UI drawn using excalidraw" width="880" height="263"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#used-these-js-lib"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Used these js lib
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Lib&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Version&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Use&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;dropzone.min.js&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;^5.9.3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Multi drop images&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sortable.js&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;^*&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sort dropzone instances&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;select2.min.js&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;^4.0.13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;For multiselect&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;jquery.js&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;^0.3.1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;simple add/remove items from dom&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Html drag and drop API, was able to create the ui.&lt;br&gt;
Renaming is done via server side(Laravel php),I just pass 2 arrays&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Names&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply merge the arrays,save the file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32007662/147849196-5ba3c92c-1fd4-49e4-a83f-e7e998ba05bb.mp4"&gt;video demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Docker - Run/Refactor PHP code from a web interface</title>
      <author>Christophe Avonture</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 11:11:31 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/cavo789/docker-runrefactor-php-code-from-a-web-interface-1ffn</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/cavo789/docker-runrefactor-php-code-from-a-web-interface-1ffn</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a loyal reader of several forums for years, I frequently find unreadable PHP code posted by beginners asking for help. Before we can try to help them, it is sometimes useful to reformat the code and rewrite it partially. This can take times...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To execute the code to see where the problem is before fixing it, I have been using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/websiteduck/Run-PHP-Code"&gt;Run-PHP-Code&lt;/a&gt; tool for a few years but it does not meet the need for reformatting (&lt;a href="https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer"&gt;php-cs-fixer&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/"&gt;php code-beautifier&lt;/a&gt;) or refactoring (&lt;a href="https://github.com/rectorphp/rector"&gt;rector&lt;/a&gt;). Second disadvantage here (since I don't trust the PHP code), &lt;em&gt;Run-PHP-Code&lt;/em&gt; is running on my localhost i.e. on my machine and that can represent a risk (creation/deletion of files, ...). The ideal is to execute the code in a sandbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It had been a while since I wanted to do it: I took some hours to take the code of &lt;em&gt;Run-PHP-Code&lt;/em&gt; to make his own Docker image, based on PHP 7.4.26 and thus to allow to run it in a secure environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also took the time to add a "refactor" button which then calls php-cs-fixer, phpcbf and Rector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is this ready-to-use Docker image: &lt;a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/cavo789/runcode"&gt;https://hub.docker.com/r/cavo789/runcode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In only two CLI commands, you will have a web interface with an editor where, on the left side, you can copy/paste or type a PHP code and on the right side visualize the result of its execution (button &lt;code&gt;Run&lt;/code&gt;) or its refactoring (button &lt;code&gt;Refactor&lt;/code&gt;); the whole running in a Docker container and thus isolated from your machine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty easy and helpful when trying to give support on forums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--33DZxp0n--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/25uvrxisg07nwr7sygsz.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--33DZxp0n--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/25uvrxisg07nwr7sygsz.png" alt="Run and refactor php from an isolated environment" width="880" height="488"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tool-introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tool Introduction &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone! In this short article, I wanted to share with the DEV community here a utility tool that immensely me in 2021 for managing and developing the Software(s) I worked on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am talking about &lt;code&gt;asdf&lt;/code&gt;. While most of the PRO developers out there are aware of it. This article is to share with community members who are unaware of this like I was a few months back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;asdf&lt;/code&gt; is a CLI tool for managing &lt;strong&gt;multiple runtime(s)&lt;/strong&gt; via extendable plugins - docs at &lt;a href="//asdf-vm.com"&gt;asdf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this one single CLI tool, not only you can &lt;strong&gt;manage and switch to multiple runtime/s and its version/s&lt;/strong&gt; but can also simply avoid the &lt;strong&gt;installation overhead&lt;/strong&gt;. Thus, having a levy to switch the runtime versions in between projects you are working on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how does it works? I will be explaining this in brief in the following content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tool-managementusage"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tool Management/Usage &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can easily install &lt;code&gt;asdf&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;a href="http://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html#_3-install-asdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It has all the details and has good documentation available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, It's really simple, &lt;code&gt;asdf&lt;/code&gt; for each runtime uses a &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; plugin. A plugin shares one-to-one mapping with the runtime you want to install. After adding a plugin you can now install multiple versions of the runtime using the same plugin. Here are the simple 4 steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Search for a plugin&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;asdf plugin-list-all | grep python&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Install/Add a plugin&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;asdf plugin-add python&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Install a runtime version of your choice, default is the latest stable head/version&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;asdf install python latest&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;asdf global python latest&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above command will make an entry into an &lt;code&gt;$HOME/.tool-versions&lt;/code&gt; file (more details to follow on this config file)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can not install other runtime versions by repeating the above step no need to add a plugin as it's a one-time process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;asdf install python 3.8.7&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;asdf local python 3.8.7&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above command will make an entry into an &lt;code&gt;$WORK_DIR/.tool-versions&lt;/code&gt; file (more details to follow on this config file)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using local scope you can set the asdf version for local project scope runs on python 3.8.7 and not on python latest/3.10.1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8Yx-AbHB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x3rz1g87rjymltfvcpjf.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8Yx-AbHB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x3rz1g87rjymltfvcpjf.png" alt="asdf runtime/python installation" width="880" height="890"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another example:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FAFzd-3v--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9f3pfh3w0ox09yks4hip.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FAFzd-3v--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9f3pfh3w0ox09yks4hip.png" alt="asdf runtime/scala installation" width="880" height="723"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, with the help of &lt;code&gt;asdf&lt;/code&gt;, I can easily manage all the below runtimes some with even multiple versions like for &lt;code&gt;nodeJS&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt; etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--j8u8uitT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h1bk2j9h8veeme9drfzj.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--j8u8uitT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h1bk2j9h8veeme9drfzj.png" alt="asdf multiple runtime installations" width="880" height="544"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="#best-practices-and-tips"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Best practices and tips &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-use-of-raw-hometoolversions-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1: Use of &lt;code&gt;$HOME/.tool-versions&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to share some useful tips to make full use of &lt;code&gt;asdf&lt;/code&gt;. For most of the runtimes (particularly for a programming language(s), we maintain a &lt;em&gt;version file&lt;/em&gt; as a satellite file inside the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For &lt;em&gt;python&lt;/em&gt; it is &lt;code&gt;.python-version&lt;/code&gt;, for &lt;em&gt;nodeJS&lt;/em&gt; it is &lt;code&gt;.nvmrc&lt;/code&gt; and for &lt;em&gt;RoR&lt;/em&gt; it is &lt;code&gt;.ruby-version&lt;/code&gt;. These files are recognized as &lt;em&gt;legacy&lt;/em&gt; files to &lt;code&gt;asdf&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For &lt;code&gt;asdf&lt;/code&gt; that satellite file is called &lt;code&gt;.tool-versions&lt;/code&gt;. You can maintain one copy under a &lt;code&gt;$HOME/.tool-versions&lt;/code&gt; directory to mention the version you want to use globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For local projects, you can add another &lt;code&gt;.tool_verisons&lt;/code&gt; file under &lt;code&gt;$WORK_DIR/.tool-versions&lt;/code&gt;. So every time you check-in into the project &lt;code&gt;asdf&lt;/code&gt; knows which version to switch for a particular runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what my &lt;code&gt;~/.tool-versions&lt;/code&gt; file looks like (globally) attaching for reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rXXHPbAB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fv5esgjgrnafenhlacow.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rXXHPbAB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fv5esgjgrnafenhlacow.png" alt="Global tool-versions" width="880" height="1481"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-use-of-raw-homeasdfrc-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2: Use of &lt;code&gt;$HOME/.asdfrc&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may not want to use/manage multiple satellite files just for the sake of auto-switching of the runtime version. In such a case we can you one config file &lt;code&gt;~/.asdfrc&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/.asdfrc&lt;/code&gt; is the configuration file for managing &lt;code&gt;asdf&lt;/code&gt;. As spells out from the file name it is based on &lt;strong&gt;cosmic config&lt;/strong&gt; configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For &lt;code&gt;asdf&lt;/code&gt; to work with the legacy version file you need to turn on the switch for &lt;code&gt;legacy_version_file&lt;/code&gt; under &lt;code&gt;$HOME/.asdfrc&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;legacy_version_file = yes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this config is turned on it means that &lt;code&gt;asdf&lt;/code&gt; can globally/locally pick the versions based on the legacy file if the &lt;code&gt;.tool-versions&lt;/code&gt; file is not found. More details &lt;a href="//ide/getting-started.html#using-existing-tool-version-files"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more generic use case is to have one &lt;code&gt;.tool-versions&lt;/code&gt; file for a project which builds on using multiple runtimes of a particular version. It makes lots of sense to switch to a single &lt;code&gt;.tool-versions&lt;/code&gt; file instead of maintaining multiple &lt;code&gt;legacy&lt;/code&gt; files. O/w in most cases legacy files are usually preferred! and &lt;code&gt;asdf&lt;/code&gt; support that as well via the &lt;code&gt;.asdfrc&lt;/code&gt; config file as mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-from-my-experience-with-this-tool"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3: From my experience with this tool
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may happen that you for some runtimes/tools you are not able to install/list a plugin, in such cases, a google search will help. For example below plugin URL, I found by searching on Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--W95nL45J--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c6j62fva8es0tjci7i1o.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--W95nL45J--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c6j62fva8es0tjci7i1o.png" alt="asdf built-in plugin not found" width="880" height="357"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope, this article may help the DEV community who are unaware of this cool utility software development till the time of reading this post. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It not only help to manage &lt;strong&gt;multiple runtime(s)&lt;/strong&gt; in a single click but at the same time helps in avoiding all the &lt;strong&gt;installation overhead&lt;/strong&gt; and conflicts among them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, you might be wondering about the full form/meaning of &lt;code&gt;asdf&lt;/code&gt; let me tell you its a series of keys on your keyboard :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;br&gt;

      <title>In JavaScript Console Other Than Console.log()</title>
      <author>Kamran Ahmad</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 10:39:06 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/officialkamran/in-javascript-console-other-than-consolelog-5222</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/officialkamran/in-javascript-console-other-than-consolelog-5222</guid>
      <description>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Console.count()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let assume you want to keep a count of how many click the user makes on the button. The code with .log() might look like this&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;let userClickCounter = 0;
function watchUserClicks(){
userClickCounter++;
console.log("User Clicked ${userClickCounter}")
}
&amp;lt;button onclick = "watchUserClicks()"&amp;gt;
Click Me to Without pause
&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The other method is also present&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;function watchUserClick(){
consol.count('User Click');
}
&amp;lt;button onclick = "watchUserClicks()"&amp;gt;
Click Me to Without pause
&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here the need for variable and its related code is eliminated thereby, making the code optimal and readable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Console.Dir()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This method shows all the properties of the JS Object.&lt;br&gt;
The console.log() print out toString representation whereas consol.dir() print out a navigation tree&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;see the difference:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--csErmDrP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/is91b14d3w7eysw2rr93.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--csErmDrP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/is91b14d3w7eysw2rr93.jpg" alt="Image description" width="880" height="305"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This method come to the real help when you want to show a single Dom Element like this&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rC2KARFV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ymxx0s7a2fec36fqmra7.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rC2KARFV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ymxx0s7a2fec36fqmra7.jpg" alt="Image description" width="880" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Console.Time() and Console.ThimeEnd()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are working on a complex algorithm. time is one of the main factor you need to look on simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this is where you can use these console method to know how much time your algorithm is taking to execute.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3gEj2YXO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u3utg7zqdox6s8fitq32.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3gEj2YXO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u3utg7zqdox6s8fitq32.jpg" alt="Image description" width="880" height="800"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Console.table()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the best method vs console.log() to show an object In JS. this method is used to represent complex object or arrays in tabular format.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--f0v8O8Pf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oedhpj9pg8suz7gby9o1.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--f0v8O8Pf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oedhpj9pg8suz7gby9o1.jpg" alt="Image description" width="880" height="717"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to add Color to your code snippets using markdown</title>
      <author>Jima Victor </author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 10:36:47 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/jimajs/how-to-add-color-to-your-code-snippets-using-markdown-fic</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/jimajs/how-to-add-color-to-your-code-snippets-using-markdown-fic</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Which one of these look better?&lt;br&gt;
this?👇&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;function printHello() {
 console.log("Hello"); // prints hello to the console..
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;or this..👇&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;printHello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// prints hello to the console..&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That's right! The code snippet with colors definitely looks better and there are many advantages of using this feature built into text editors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feature that enables us to add colors to our code is known as &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;syntax highlighting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and it makes it easier and more enjoyable to read and understand code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-add-syntax-hightlighting-in-markdown"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to add syntax hightlighting in markdown
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is actually very easy to implement. All you have to do is add the name of the the programming language after the backticks in your markdown editor.&lt;br&gt;
like this👇&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;


```javascript
function printHello() {
 console.log("Hello"); // prints hello to the console..
}
```


&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and viola! You're done!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make the world beautiful today by adding some color to it😊&lt;br&gt;
Happy New Year Coders🎉🎉🎉..&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Day 67 of 100 Days of Code &amp; Scrum: Back From Holiday Break!</title>
      <author>Rammina</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 10:25:37 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/rammina/day-67-of-100-days-of-code-scrum-back-from-holiday-break-5hh4</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/rammina/day-67-of-100-days-of-code-scrum-back-from-holiday-break-5hh4</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year, everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a long time off from coding and blogging during the holiday season. My &lt;a href="https://blog.rammina.com/day-66-of-100-days-of-code-and-scrum-services-and-portfolio-pages-for-my-business-website"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; was back from December 21, 2021. I just wanted to take a break from my usual daily routine and spend time with people that I cared for the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I finally went back into it! I have a long list of tasks that I have to deal with as a result of taking a break for about two weeks. I managed to deal with my social media backlog, which I haven't checked in a while. Also, I checked my e-mails and other messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my remaining free time, I studied Scrum for my upcoming Professional Scrum Master I (PSM I) certification exam. Also, I re-examined my &lt;a href="https://www.rammina.com"&gt;company website&lt;/a&gt;, found some of the things that didn't work as intended, as well as thought of ways to improve the &lt;a href="https://www.rammina.com/portfolio"&gt;Portfolio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.rammina.com/services"&gt;Services&lt;/a&gt; sections of the website. It was kind of difficult to start working after such a long break, but it shouldn't take me long to get back my lost momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, let's move on to my first daily report of the year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#two-week-holiday-break"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Two Week Holiday Break
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No coding, blogging, and social media. Time was spent with my wife playing games, reading novels, eating unhealthy Christmas food, watching movies, and unproductive things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#today"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Today
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the things I learned and worked on today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#company-website"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Company Website
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I found a few things that are either bugs or not working as intended in my &lt;a href="https://www.rammina.com"&gt;business website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;plan out how to improve the &lt;a href="https://www.rammina.com/portfolio"&gt;Portfolio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.rammina.com/services"&gt;Services&lt;/a&gt; sections of the website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#scrum"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Scrum
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I reread the &lt;a href="https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html"&gt;2020 Scrum Guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Took some practice exams for the Professional Scrum Master I (PSM I) certification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I did some practice flashcards for Scrum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reviewed some of the things I've learned before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#other-stuff"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Other Stuff
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;replied to emails and social media messages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope everyone had a great time during the holidays. And I wish you all the best for this new year!&lt;/p&gt;
