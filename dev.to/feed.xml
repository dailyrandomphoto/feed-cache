      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the agile development methodology, the velocity of testing holds the key to delivering the best quality software within the stipulated budget and time constraints. As such, this drives the need to automate the testing process. Most software development teams visualize test automation as a discreet step in the delivery lifecycle instead of viewing it as a designed sequence of steps. There are various aspects of testing through which software needs to pass, such as unit testing, functional testing, integration testing, smoke testing, performance testing, and more. Each of these needs to be automated in order to achieve certainty of software behavior and reduce the time to test. However, simply automating the tests is not enough to achieve the desired levels of quality and reduction in the time and cost to get there. This is where test orchestration plays an essential role.&lt;br&gt;

      <title>The Arrow Function in JS!</title>

      <link>https://dev.to/ziratsu/the-arrow-function-in-js-528f</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/ziratsu/the-arrow-function-in-js-528f</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey &lt;strong&gt;fellow creators&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;arrow function&lt;/em&gt; exists since 2015 and is quite different from the classic functions. Let’s see how !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you prefer to watch the video &lt;strong&gt;version&lt;/strong&gt;, it's right here :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O6lMYOT6XLs"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-how-to-use-an-arrow-function"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. How to use an arrow function.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the basic syntax, we don't need the "function" keyword and we put it by default in a constant, that way we won't have hoisting issues.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you have just a return, you can use the short version.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you have one parameter (but only one), you can remove the parenthesis which would make it even more concise:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s very useful when you use it with some higher order function like the &lt;em&gt;map.()&lt;/em&gt; method:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;multiplied&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-the-difference-between-a-classic-function-and-an-arrow-function"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. The difference between a classic function and an arrow function.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main difference between the classic and arrow function is the value of "this".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use a classic function as the value of a property in an object, "this" will refer to the calling context, i.e. the obj where the function is defined :&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// {a: 5, foo: ƒ}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, if you use an arrow function, "this" will return the global object.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Window Object&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In that case, this will refer to the parent of the calling context, thus the global object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of refering the direct context, it will refer to the parent of that context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to keep that difference in mind when you are dealing with functions and the "this" keyword.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come and take a look at my &lt;strong&gt;Youtube channel&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Learntocreate/videos"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/c/Learntocreate/videos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to use spot instances during the Christmas frenzy?</title>
      <author>CAST AI</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 09:26:32 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/castai/how-to-use-spot-instances-during-the-christmas-frenzy-5c0f</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/castai/how-to-use-spot-instances-during-the-christmas-frenzy-5c0f</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ve been doing a great job using spot instances for the entire year. But as 2021 is coming to a close, you might have noticed that there’s less inventory of your favorite instance types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even when you manage to get your hands on some, &lt;strong&gt;they get reclaimed rather quickly&lt;/strong&gt;. Everyone else needs extra capacity during the holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you even trust spot instances to reduce your costs at such a critical time?&lt;/strong&gt; Should you run everything on on-demand instances and pay the premium just to keep the application running? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are the questions we will answer in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jump to the section that’s most relevant to you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#dealingwithspotinstanceinterruptions"&gt;Dealing with spot instance interruptions manually is hard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#andwhatifyouhandledspotinstancesautomatically"&gt;And what if you handled the spot interruptions automatically?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#automationtakesmanytasksoffyourplate"&gt;Automation takes many tasks off your plate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#hereshowspotinstanceautomationworks"&gt;Here’s how spot instance automation works in practice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#theresultsmaysurpriseyou"&gt;The results may surprise you&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="dealingwithspotinstanceinterruptions"&gt;Dealing with spot instance interruptions manually is hard&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hyperscalers like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure have massive data centers scattered around the globe. At some point, they find themselves with spare capacity and they offer it at a discounted price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only catch is that the vendor can pull the plug at any time. This makes spot instances generally difficult to manage for production workloads. When getting a spot instance, you have no guarantee on how long it will stay available.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vendors only share some historical data about past interruptions to help you make a more informed decision. Or notify you when the risk of interruption increases for the instance you’re using to give you some extra time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spot instance is reclaimed with short notice - from 2 minutes to as little as 30 seconds. &lt;strong&gt;Is that enough time to drop everything and find a replacement for your instance? &lt;/strong&gt;You may know a superhuman engineer who’s able to do that, but they surely have more productive tasks to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spinning up a new instance takes time &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even if you identify the virtual machine where to move your workload, creating a new one takes time, so you’re still facing the danger of potential downtime. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Running paused machines means extra costs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you could have some paused machines at your disposal that could step in if you happen to lose a spot instance. But this comes at an additional price, and aren’t you in the spot business to save on your cloud costs? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spot instance availability changes rapidly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another issue is that the available capacity sold as spot instances can differ a lot based on size, region, time of day, and many other factors - all subject to frequent changes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The availability of an instance is based on supply and demand. So if you pick the most popular instance types and a market surge like Black Friday occurs, prepare for a nasty surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="andwhatifyouhandledspotinstancesautomatically"&gt;And what if you handled the spot interruptions automatically?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using an automation platform addresses all the problems listed above and makes all the difference when it comes to your cloud bill. You can rely on spot instances even during the most intense times of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At CAST AI, we have the &lt;strong&gt;Spot Fallback feature that keeps your workloads running even if the cloud provider sells all the capacity and there are no spot instances left for you to use&lt;/strong&gt;. If no spot instances matching your requirements are available, the autoscaler temporarily adds an on-demand node for your spot-only workloads so they have a place to run on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the inventory of Spot/Preemptible instances is available again, the autoscaler replaces the on-demand nodes used during the fallback with actual spot instances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That way you can still get the benefits of spot instances without having to be anxious about the potential downtime.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5IH2fgwS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cast.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Spot-Fallback-GIF.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5IH2fgwS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cast.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Spot-Fallback-GIF.gif" alt="spot instances" width="600" height="314"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="automationtakesmanytasksoffyourplate"&gt;Automation takes many tasks off your plate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But arguably the best part is that you don’t need to care about provisioning instances. Moving a workload from one spot instance to another is challenging if you do it manually because it’s a multi-step process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Examine the cloud provider offer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check the less popular instances - they're less likely to be interrupted and can run for longer periods of time. Before deciding to buy an instance, look at how often it is interrupted (its interruption or eviction rate).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Make your bid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set the maximum price you want to spend for your preferred spot instance. The rule of thumb is to follow the level of on-demand pricing and avoid getting interrupted when the price of that instance spikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Manage spot instances in groups&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This opens the doors to request a variety of instance types at the same time and increases your chances of securing a spot instance. You can get more tips about managing spot instances here: &lt;a href="https://cast.ai/blog/how-to-reduce-cloud-costs-by-90-spot-instances-and-how-to-use-them/" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Spot instances: How to reduce AWS, Azure, and GCP costs by 90%&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make spot instances work and secure the right mix of instances, you’ll have to dedicate a lot of time and effort to configuration, setup, and maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good automation platform will do them all for you. All you need to do is set up the right policies and see your workloads gracefully moved from one instance to another when interruption happens. Here’s how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="hereshowspotinstanceautomationworks"&gt;Here’s how spot instance automation works in practice &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CAST AI is an automation platform that uses a mix of tactics to optimize cloud costs and help teams get the performance they need. This approach extends to how spot instances are automated in CAST AI. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The platform doesn’t stick to a predefined list of instance types, but instead scans workloads for spot suitability and matches their requirements automatically. You can edit the list of spot-suitable workloads afterwards. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This flow is a lot faster than selecting the instance types you prefer manually and picking the pods which shouldn’t run on spot instances at all. The AI checks it all for you in minutes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the times when everyone is competing for spot instances they know and use, you will be playing in a mostly empty playground of ALL instance types suitable for your application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Configuring the automation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can automate spot instances on Kubernetes workloads running on EKS, Kops, AKS, and GKE. Here’s a short overview of how you can configure CAST AI to cover all the scenarios your application might face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tolerations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This configuration comes in handy when spot instances are an optional choice for your workload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When your pod is marked only with tolerations, the Kubernetes scheduler can place the pod on both spot and regular nodes, always picking the most cost-effective resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Node Selectors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this configuration, workloads will only use spot instances. The autoscaling mechanism will pick a spot instance whenever your pod requires an additional workload in the cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Node Affinity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we use spot instances if they’re available - if not, the application falls back to on-demand instances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if a spot instance gets interrupted and the on-demand instances in the cluster have some available capacity, pods that previously ran on that spot instance will be scheduled on the available on-demand resources. Moving your workloads back to spot instances is possible via the Rebalancer feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spot Reliability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This configuration focuses on minimizing the chance of workload interruptions. The autoscaler identifies which instance types are less likely to be interrupted and you can set a default reliability value to be applied across the entire cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reliability value is measured by the percentage of reclaimed instances during the trailing month for this instance type. Click &lt;a href="https://docs.cast.ai/guides/spot/#tolerations"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more info.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can control the reliability value at a more granular level, per workload. For example, you can leave the most cost-efficient value globally and choose more stable instances for specific workloads. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="theresultsmaysurpriseyou"&gt;The results may surprise you&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6yeviT4A--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cast.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Optimize-CAST-AI.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6yeviT4A--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cast.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Optimize-CAST-AI.png" alt="" width="880" height="461"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, we decided to check whether we were really using the best instances available and were shocked to see this spot instance recommendation: the INF1 instance. Who would CAST AI pick that for us? It's essentially a supercomputer for high-performance ML inference that costs a lot if you buy it for on-demand pricing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funnily enough, the CAST AI platform didn’t go off rails. The INF1 spot instance was actually cheaper at that point in time than the typical instance we were getting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while everyone was manually competing for what they knew, we rented a Ferrari for the price of a Fiat just because automation looked at every single instance type that can do the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we were choosing instances manually, we’d never look into this category. Automation expanded our reach and got us this gem of an instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are ready to quit competing on the same level everyone’s on - let us know and we’ll happily show you around the CAST AI platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like all service upgrades, MySQL is no different. Bump the service version, build the docker image, try to “make up“ the project and hope for the best. I’ve decided to dedicate this blog to four things that turned this “it is going to be an easy project” to “8 months in hell while upgrading MySQL from v5.6 to v8.0”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-fantastic-sql-modes-and-where-to-find-them"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Fantastic SQL modes and where to find them
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While looking at all changes made to MySQL between v5.6 and v8.0, I came across something rather interesting. They announced they had enabled a bunch of other previously optional SQL modes as a part of strict mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, only &lt;em&gt;NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION&lt;/em&gt; mode was enabled in our database. 😕?!?! What could possibly go wrong after years of using the database with strict mode off?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of things apparently, so I made a list of modes I need to enable/check out before finally enabling &lt;em&gt;STRICT_TRANS_TABLES&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO&lt;/em&gt; → &lt;a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/sql-mode.html#sqlmode_error_for_division_by_zero"&gt;in later versions, no longer an option but part of strict mode&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;NO_ZERO_IN_DATE&lt;/em&gt; → &lt;a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/sql-mode.html#sqlmode_no_zero_in_date"&gt;in later versions, no longer an option but part of strict mode&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER&lt;/em&gt; → &lt;a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/sql-mode.html#sqlmode_no_auto_create_user"&gt;in version 8.0, no longer an option but part of strict mode&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;NO_ZERO_DATE&lt;/em&gt; → &lt;a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/sql-mode.html#sqlmode_no_zero_in_date"&gt;in later versions, no longer an option but part of strict mode&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY&lt;/em&gt; → decided to leave it disabled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION&lt;/em&gt; → was already enabled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;STRICT_TRANS_TABLES&lt;/em&gt; → needs to be enabled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This little side quest of cleaning up migrations, Doctrine entities which were not in sync with corresponding database tables, fixtures, using null for everything — does not matter is the field nullable or not, missing primary keys on tables etc. cost us 193,4 hours (around 33 days) just to make the application run with some additional SQL modes enabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-sphinx-client-issues"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Sphinx client issues
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some legacy parts of our application still used Sphinx instead of ElasticSearch. We faced a tough choice then and there because MySQL v8.0 had a new default authentication plugin &lt;em&gt;caching_sha2_password&lt;/em&gt;, and Sphinx v2.2.4, that we were still using, uses the old authentication plugin &lt;em&gt;mysql_native_password&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connecting to Sphinx with a user that was using &lt;em&gt;caching_sha2_password&lt;/em&gt; authentication plugin resulted in:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;bash-4.4$ mysql -hsphinx -usphinx 
ERROR 2003 (HY000): Can't connect to MySQL server on 'sphinx' (111)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, we tried to create a user that used the old authentication plugin. That still resulted with an error:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;bash-4.4$ mysql -hsphinx -P9306 
ERROR 2000 (HY000): Unknown MySQL error
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://sphinxsearch.com/docs/sphinx3.html#version-3.1.1-17-oct-2018"&gt;Issues with connecting to MySQL client 8.0+ were fixed in Sphinx v3.1.1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This left us with two possible ways to go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upgrade legacy parts of the application, that we all want removed, to v3.1.1 — not too much effort&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove Sphinx from the project — little sub-project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went with a 751 hour endeavor for 5 people and removed Sphinx from the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-the-magnificent-world-of-charsets-collates-and-row-formats"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. The magnificent world of charsets, collates and row formats
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#about-charsets-and-collates"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  About charsets and collates
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MySQL uses &lt;em&gt;UTF8&lt;/em&gt; as an alias for the now deprecated &lt;em&gt;UTF8MB3&lt;/em&gt;. It is expected, at some point in the future, that &lt;em&gt;UTF8&lt;/em&gt; will become an alias for the &lt;em&gt;UTF8MB4&lt;/em&gt; charset. In a future MySQL release, &lt;em&gt;UTF8MB3&lt;/em&gt; should be removed. You can read more about it &lt;a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/charset-unicode-utf8mb3.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To follow the recommendation, we decided to change our charset to &lt;em&gt;UTF8MB4&lt;/em&gt;. To match our brand new charset, we had to change the collate to any one compatible with &lt;em&gt;UTF8MB4&lt;/em&gt; charset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#about-row-formats"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  About row formats
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four row formats: &lt;em&gt;REDUNDANT, COMPACT, DYNAMIC&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;COMPRESSED&lt;/em&gt;. MySQL v5.6 uses &lt;em&gt;COMPACT&lt;/em&gt; by default, and v5.7 and later use DYNAMIC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-row-format.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The DYNAMIC row format offers the same storage characteristics as the COMPACT row format but adds enhanced storage capabilities for long variable-length columns and supports large index key prefixes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our code, we like to use these “cutting edge” things from the “era gone by”, meaning, we used row format &lt;em&gt;FIXED&lt;/em&gt;. It is so deprecated, that if &lt;em&gt;innodb_strict_mode&lt;/em&gt; is disabled, InnoDB issues a warning and assumes row format &lt;em&gt;DYNAMIC&lt;/em&gt;, and if innodb_strict_mode is enabled, InnoDB returns an error. We replaced &lt;em&gt;FIXED&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;COMPACT&lt;/em&gt; row formats with &lt;em&gt;DYNAMIC&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a bug. 🐛&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you try to create an index on a field that exceeds 767 bytes you will get an error that looks like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ERROR 1709 (HY000): Index column size too large. The maximum column size is 767 bytes
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But it was still possible to create an index like that if you were using row format &lt;em&gt;COMPRESSED&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;REDUNDANT&lt;/em&gt;, or you didn’t explicitly define row format &lt;em&gt;DYNAMIC&lt;/em&gt;. The result, after a server reboot, the table was inaccessible and could not be recovered. But luckily, this &lt;a href="https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=99791"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; was fixed in MySQL v8.0.22.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you still want to create an index on VARCHAR field, make sure the length is less or equal to 190. This is because &lt;em&gt;UTF8&lt;/em&gt; takes up to (3*255) 765 bytes, and &lt;em&gt;UTF8MB4&lt;/em&gt; takes up to (4*255) 1020 bytes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-real-issue"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The real issue
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, not to hard. So we change the charset, collate and row format. Big woop, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real hard part was altering every single table in the production database. This will not be a problem if you do not have any huge tables, but if you do, these alters can and will take hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trickiest thing of all is altering all these tables with some reasonable downtime. Because, if you try to join two tables with a different collate and charset — it will fail. If you try to alter everything on one slave, and then replicate it — it will fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your safest bet is to backup or delete some data you can spare to reduce the table size. Or create new empty tables that will be used while the real ones are being altered and sync the deltas once it is over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-mysql-query-cache-is-no-more"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. MySQL query cache is no more
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you rely on MySQL query cache, you will have to replace it with something else. It was deprecated in MySQL v5.7 and completely removed in MySQL v8.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some alternatives, like ProxySQL query cache. But there are definitely some cutbacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the simplest alternative, really easy to setup, benchmarks show better throughput — meaning performance boost. But…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike MySQL query cache that would invalidate the cache every time there was a write, in ProxySQL there is no way to define a way to invalidate the cache other then &lt;em&gt;cache_ttl&lt;/em&gt;. This can definitely be a limitation because there is a chance you will serve some stale data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other then that, it does not support caching prepared statements and there is no way to manually purge the query cache. There is a parameter &lt;em&gt;mysql-query_cache_size_MB&lt;/em&gt; that defines how big your cache can get. But this is not strict, it is only used to automatically trigger the query cache purge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, it just depends on whether or not this is acceptable to you. You can find more about it &lt;a href="https://www.percona.com/blog/2018/02/07/proxysql-query-cache/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are planning on upgrading MySQL, I hope you will find this helpful. The biggest problem for me was underestimating the time needed for delivering the project. I wrote this post, if for nothing else, to help you know what to look out for. :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Open Source win: IBM shifts legacy commerce systems to my one-man OSS project</title>
      <author>Michael Bromley</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 08:58:10 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/michlbrmly/open-source-win-ibm-shifts-legacy-commerce-systems-to-my-one-man-oss-project-4n9b</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/michlbrmly/open-source-win-ibm-shifts-legacy-commerce-systems-to-my-one-man-oss-project-4n9b</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the past 3.5 years I've been working on an open-source e-commerce platform, &lt;a href="https://www.vendure.io/"&gt;Vendure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's in a niche known as "headless commerce" which is really hot right now, so I've had lots of interest from investors over the past year. However, I'm determined to see how far I can take things as a bootstrapped indie-hacker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was a major milestone as I was able to announce that &lt;a href="https://www.vendure.io/case-study/ibm/"&gt;IBM have adopted Vendure&lt;/a&gt; to replace an outdated, proprietary system that had been slowing them down and causing huge expense in terms of license fees as well as lost developer productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--z2PaT0C6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.vendure.io/case-study/ibm/ibm-header.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--z2PaT0C6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.vendure.io/case-study/ibm/ibm-header.jpg" alt="case study image" width="877" height="438"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is really exciting because it shows just how much progress the open-source movement has made, that even the largest enterprises are willing to bet on lean, relatively new projects like Vendure - a single-person open-source project!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a sign that the technology stack &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; important. Developer experience, maintainability, documentation, openness - all these things actually contribute to the cost of running a system. So from both a technical &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; financial viewpoint, OSS solutions increasingly make more sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's that old phrase, "nobody got fired for buying IBM". Well, I'm hoping that this will make it clear that my project is a safe choice, no matter the company size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just thought I'd share the success!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to know more about Vendure, I recently wrote a &lt;a href="https://dev.to/michlbrmly/set-up-a-nodejs-e-commerce-app-in-10-minutes-with-vendure-287b"&gt;short intro tutorial&lt;/a&gt;, and I plan a more in-depth series of tutorials in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Getting Started with Comet ML</title>
      <author>Angelica Lo Duca</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 08:24:46 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/alod83/getting-started-with-comet-ml-169k</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/alod83/getting-started-with-comet-ml-169k</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;An overview of the popular experimentation platform for Machine Learning, with a practical example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comet ML is an experimentation platform, which permits testing Machine Learning projects, from the beginning up to the final monitoring. Many other similar platforms exist on the Web, including Neptune.ai, Guild.ai, Sacred, and so on.&lt;br&gt;
Comet ML can be easily integrated with the most popular Machine Learning libraries, including scikit-learn, Pytorch, Tensorflow, Keras, and so on. Experiments can be written in Python, Javascript, Java, R, and REST APIs.&lt;br&gt;
In this article, I focus on Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article is organized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overview of Comet ML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with Comet ML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example of usage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-overview-of-comet-ml"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1 Overview of Comet ML
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comet ML is an online platform, which permits tracking experiments. The main advantage of Comet ML is that I can easily build a reporting dashboard and a monitoring system.&lt;br&gt;
Comet ML provides the following features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;compare experiments: I can easily build different experiments for the same project, and compare the results, in terms of metrics, system metrics, parameters, and so on;
monitor the model: I can monitor the model from the early stages up to production. This can be done through alerts and debugging strategies;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;collaborate with other people: I can share my workspace project with other people;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;build reports and panels: starting from the results of my experiment, I can easily build reports and dashboards;
keep my project public or make it public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-working-with-comet-ml"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2 Working with Comet ML
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I enter the Comet ML Web site, I can create a free account. Then, I log in to the platform and I create a new project, by clicking the relative top right button. I fill the form with needed information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I click on the Create button, an empty dashboard appears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can add a new experiment, by clicking the button on the top right of the page (+Add). I select Experiment from the dropdown menu.&lt;br&gt;
The platform generates a new API for the experiment, that can be used in my Python code:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;# import comet_ml at the top of your file
from comet_ml import Experiment

# Create an experiment with your api key
experiment = Experiment(
    api_key="PUT HERE MY API KEY",
    project_name="decisiontree",
    workspace="PUT HERE MY ACCOUNT NAME",
)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, I need to install the comet_ml Python package on my local computer:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip3 install comet_ml 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And then I can start coding, as usual.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building Docker Images Faster for Webpack</title>
      <author>Pablo Chico de Guzman</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 07:58:33 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/okteto/building-docker-images-faster-for-webpack-44jc</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/okteto/building-docker-images-faster-for-webpack-44jc</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At Okteto we are very passionate about increasing developer productivity. We were looking for ways to improve our container build times when we came across an amazing project, &lt;a href="https://github.com/moby/buildkit"&gt;BuildKit&lt;/a&gt;. BuildKit helps us build Docker images faster than ever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when getting started we found that there were very few practical examples on how one could optimize their Dockerfiles with Buildkit - so we thought why not change that? This article is going to be about how you too can optimize your Docker builds using &lt;a href="https://github.com/moby/buildkit/blob/master/frontend/dockerfile/docs/syntax.md#run---mounttypecache"&gt;Buildkit caches&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-why"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Why
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first question which arises is, why even bother with optimizing your Dockerfiles? Well, the thing is that containers have revolutionized how we build, ship, and run our applications these days. So much so that containers are now heavily integrated into the development cycle and are built over and over - manually or in CI pipelines for testing and live previews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest quality of life improvement that comes with better image build times is faster testing and review cycles. The quicker everyone can see and test the changes they make, the more the productivity of the team would increase! We have first-hand witnessed this for our website, but more on that &lt;a href="#performance-evaluation"&gt;later&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-standard-dockerfile-for-webpack"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Standard Dockerfile for Webpack
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we look at how we can speed up build times using BuildKit, let's first see how a standard Dockerfile for Webpack should look like.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Dockerfile&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="s"&gt;FROM node:16 as build&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="s"&gt;WORKDIR /usr/src/app&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="s"&gt;COPY package.json yarn.lock ./&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;RUN yarn install&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="s"&gt;COPY . .&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;RUN yarn build&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="s"&gt;FROM nginx:alpine&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;COPY --from=build /usr/src/app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;EXPOSE &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;80&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This Dockerfile uses a &lt;code&gt;build&lt;/code&gt; step to build the final artifacts, and then, it copies the artifacts to an &lt;code&gt;nginx&lt;/code&gt; image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to optimize the Dockerfile instructions cache, we are purposefully &lt;strong&gt;first&lt;/strong&gt; copying &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;yarn.lock&lt;/code&gt; to install the runtime dependencies. We don't copy over everything else in this same step since most of the commits don't change the yarn dependencies, allowing this step to be cached in those cases leading to better build times! But this is already a commonly known best practice and BuildKit would help us optimize the process even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next thing we do is to &lt;code&gt;COPY&lt;/code&gt; all our remaining files from our local folder to our &lt;code&gt;WORKDIR&lt;/code&gt;. Our changes would be made to one of these files so this means that &lt;code&gt;yarn build&lt;/code&gt; is always executed unlike the &lt;code&gt;yarn install&lt;/code&gt; instruction above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember to configure your &lt;code&gt;.dockerignore&lt;/code&gt; file. In this case, adding &lt;code&gt;.git&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; to your &lt;code&gt;.dockerignore&lt;/code&gt; file will dramatically reduce the time to send your build context to the docker daemon. This is even more relevant if your build is running on a remote server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#optimizing-the-standard-dockerfile"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Optimizing the Standard Dockerfile
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we've looked at how a standard Dockerfile for Webpack looks like, let's see how we can leverage BuildKit caches to further reduce our build times. BuildKit enables us to configure cache folders for the &lt;code&gt;RUN&lt;/code&gt; instructions in our Dockerfile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contents of the BuildKit cache directories persist between builder invocations without invalidating the instruction cache. BuildKit also takes care of compatibility - our builds would work with any contents of the cache directory. This is necessary since another build may overwrite the cache files or GC may clean it if more storage space is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our case, we will use BuildKit caches to persist the &lt;a href="https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/cache"&gt;yarn cache&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://webpack.js.org/configuration/cache/#cachecachedirectory"&gt;webpack cache&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Dockerfile.buildkit&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="s"&gt;FROM node:16 as build&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="s"&gt;WORKDIR /usr/src/app&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="s"&gt;COPY package.json yarn.lock ./&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.yarn YARN_CACHE_FOLDER=/root/.yarn yarn install&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="s"&gt;COPY . .&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;RUN --mount=type=cache,target=./node_modules/.cache/webpack yarn build&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="s"&gt;FROM nginx:alpine&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;COPY --from=build /usr/src/app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;EXPOSE &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;80&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What this means is that &lt;code&gt;yarn install&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;yarn build&lt;/code&gt; will be much faster. This is because their contents will be cached now onwards instead of them being run from scratch every time like earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that we've not covered the installation process for BuildKit in this article since it's fairly simple and is documented well &lt;a href="https://github.com/moby/buildkit#quick-start"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#performance-evaluation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Performance Evaluation
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The improvement in build times we saw for our website after using BuildKit was phenomenal! Have a look yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IRdhgSSP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pem7j1ujloqqxpc9dfbq.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IRdhgSSP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pem7j1ujloqqxpc9dfbq.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="698"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first graph shows the performance improvement we saw whenever we changed a dependency of our website and the second one shows the boost we got from using BuildKit when making code changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means if you're building your images 100 times a day, you save more than 1 hr 23 mins of build time every day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope you too can now appreciate how powerful BuildKit is. A change of only two lines of code in your Dockerfile can dramatically decrease your image build times! We hope this article was useful and you too are now able to optimize your Docker builds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy coding!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Data Recovery Algorithm For HFS+ File System</title>
      <author>Michael Mirosnichenko</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 07:57:50 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/hetmansoftware/data-recovery-algorithm-for-hfs-file-system-428k</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/hetmansoftware/data-recovery-algorithm-for-hfs-file-system-428k</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article, we will explore the structure of HFS+ file system, and the changes that distinguish it from the previous version, HFS. We will also analyze algorithms for data recovery applied to HFS+ drives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#advantages-and-peculiarities-of-hfs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Advantages and peculiarities of HFS+
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main distinction of HFS+ is using the 32-bit architecture instead of the 16-bit in HFS. The older addressing system was a serious limitation by itself as it didn’t support work with volumes containing more than 65 536 blocks. For example, on a 1 GB disk, the allocation block size (cluster) under HFS is 16 KB, so even a 1 byte file would take up the entire 16 KB of disk space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as its predecessor, HFS+ uses the so-called B-tree to store a major part of metadata.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HFS+ volumes are divided into sectors (called logical blocks in HFS), usually 512 bytes in size. One or more sectors make up an allocation block (cluster); the number of allocation blocks depends on the total size of the volume. The 32-bit addressing allows to use over 4 294 967 296 clusters compared to the 65 536 available for 16 bit. In comparison, the two file systems differ by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;file name length: in HFS: 31, in HFS+: 255;&lt;br&gt;
file name encoding: HFS: Mac Roman, HFS+: Unicode;&lt;br&gt;
record size: HFS: 512 bytes, HFS+: 4 Kbyte;&lt;br&gt;
and the maximal number of files has increased: HFS: 2^31, HFS+: 2^63.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YouTube: &lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WUoCNzx1VwI"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#hfs-plus-architecture"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  HFS Plus architecture
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HFS Plus volumes are divided into sectors (called logical blocks in HFS), usually 512 bytes in size. These sectors are then grouped together into allocation blocks (similar to clusters in Windows) which can contain one or more sectors. The number of allocation blocks depends on the total size of the volume. HFS Plus uses a larger value to address allocation blocks than HFS, 32 bits rather than 16 bits. The file system uses Big Endian encoding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3HtpvFQe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vnkj2f70pnqsxwg7p8iu.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3HtpvFQe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vnkj2f70pnqsxwg7p8iu.png" alt="Image description" width="500" height="628"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To manage the process of data allocation on the disk, HFS+ stores special service information known as metadata. The following elements are most important for the proper operation of the file system and are of special interest when searching for missing data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volume Header. Has a table-type structure, and makes use of extent records (Extents);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allocation File. Structured as a bitmap, it makes use of extent records (Extents);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Catalog File. Has B-tree structure, and makes use of extent records (Extents);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extents Overflow File. Has a B-tree structure;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad block file. Has a B-tree structure;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;StartUp file. Fixed size;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Journal. The disk area with a fixed size and location.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The operating system includes more other structures, but the ones we have listed are of primary importance for data recovery. In order to continue examining the structure, we need to study the basic notions, B-tree and extents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-a-btree"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is a B-tree?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To store a part of information, HFS+ uses B-trees. They are required to enable writing certain amounts of data (for example, 100 MB) into fixed-size blocks (for example, 4 KB). In this case, the first block doesn’t contain the data itself, but the links to the following blocks which may either contain links to another level of blocks, or contain the actual data. The tree elements containing links are known as nodes, and zero level elements containing data are referred to as leaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PHt620BO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8zi6gxpsprz8h1jxkbzt.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PHt620BO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8zi6gxpsprz8h1jxkbzt.png" alt="Image description" width="788" height="338"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-are-extent-records-and-extent-overflow-file"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What are extent records and Extent Overflow File?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To store information on the number of blocks occupied by a file, HFS+ may use from 0 to 8 extent records. Every record contains a link to the first block containing data, and the number of sequential clusters used to store data. If a file is too fragmented and 8 records are not enough to describe all of its parts, the remaining fragments (elements) are written to the file with additional extents – Extent Overflow File.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#volume-header"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Volume header
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Volume header is always located in the second sector of the disk (counting from the beginning) and contains general information on the volume. For example, the size of allocation blocks, a timestamp that indicates when the volume was created or the location of other volume structures: Catalog File, Extent Overflow File, Allocation File, Journal etc. The second to last sector of the disk always contains Volume Header Copy, that is, the copy of the Volume Header.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--V5Y_o9VN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0wc7yqu7ant353hyo06p.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--V5Y_o9VN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0wc7yqu7ant353hyo06p.png" alt="Image description" width="788" height="639"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_2ggTxWH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hn89wft0ngt4byo2xypd.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_2ggTxWH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hn89wft0ngt4byo2xypd.png" alt="Image description" width="788" height="618"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q-4AzQVG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/iyck76rlbxe3n8dilsyf.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q-4AzQVG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/iyck76rlbxe3n8dilsyf.png" alt="Image description" width="533" height="943"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#allocation-file"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Allocation file
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It contains data on occupied and vacant allocation blocks. Each allocation block is represented by one bit. A zero value means the block is free and a one value means the block is in use. Sometimes, this structure is referred to as bitmap. The allocation file can change size and does not have to be stored contiguously within a volume. All information on the elements of the file is stored in the Volume Header.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Nr9upw7l--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/upz93frnk1t2lf4c8ec6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Nr9upw7l--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/upz93frnk1t2lf4c8ec6.png" alt="Image description" width="788" height="494"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#catalog-file"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Catalog file
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It stores a major part of data on allocation of files and folders on the disk, and it’s actually a large B-tree structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In HFS Plus, this file is very similar to the catalog file in HFS, the main difference being the field size. Now it is bigger and contains more data. For example, it allows to use longer 255-character Unicode names for files. In HFS, the record size is 512 bytes, compared to 4KB in HFS Plus for Mac OS and 8 KB for OS X. The fields in HFS have fixed size, while HFS Plus lets them have varied size depending on the actual amount of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most fields store small attributes which can be fitted into 4 KB of space. For larger attributes, additional extents are used (the maximum number available is 8 extents, and if any more are needed, they are saved to Extent Overflow File). The extents contain links to the other fields where data of the larger attribute is stored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#startup-file"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  StartUp file
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This file is intended for operating systems which don’t support HFS or HFS Plus, And is similar to boot blocks in HFS volumes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#bad-blocks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Bad blocks
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This file contains data on all relocated (faulty) blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#journal"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Journal
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Journal is not a file but rather a fixed-size area (set of blocks) on the disk. Links to the first blocks and the size of the area are stored in the Volume Header. Before any changes are written to the disk, HFS+ writes them to the journal, and only then to the system files. In case of a power cut happening during the writing operation, the file system can be restored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted, though, that the journal size in HFS+ is limited and its contents get overwritten regularly. The boot volume journal in Mac Mini is usually overwritten within 5-10 minutes, and the time before it gets overwritten in MacBook is about 30 minutes. If Time Machine is enabled, this time is reduced to 20 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--knHVrwaQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/27m1ipwe0vw2ylnegth3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--knHVrwaQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/27m1ipwe0vw2ylnegth3.png" alt="Image description" width="788" height="494"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#data-recovery-in-time-machine"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Data recovery in Time Machine
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beginning with Mac OS X Leopard, the operating system includes Time Machine. This utility creates backup copies of files to record all changes that happen to the file system. All these things help users restore the entire operating system, several files or an individual file in exactly the same form it was in at a certain moment of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allocate a separate disk for Time Machine to use. Apple manufactures a special device, Apple Time Capsule, which can be used specifically as a network drive for storing Time Machine backup files. Time Machine can be used with any USB or eSATA disk. When you start it for the first time, Time Machine creates a folder on the specified backup (reserve) disk to contain all the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, Time Machine will only copy the modified files. Generally speaking, as long as Time Machine is used for a disk, recovering lost data is not much of a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QKkAUuBW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qwp7ajjoesaqk2dpnm6v.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QKkAUuBW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qwp7ajjoesaqk2dpnm6v.png" alt="Image description" width="578" height="380"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#recovery-algorithm-for-hfs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Recovery algorithm for HFS+
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recovering data from HFS+ file system is more difficult than from other file systems. One of the aspects causing difficulties is that HFS+ uses B-trees to store most volume metadata on allocation of files. After a file is removed, the B-tree is updated immediately, so the information on where the removed file was located is lost at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our program lets you see the storage device and the HFS+ structure in Windows without using any extra software or drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While running a full analysis scan, its algorithm allows to exclude these elements when searching for lost data, and recover the information we need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you choose a fast scan, the program reads the Volume Header or its copy, gains access to the Catalog file and location of the journal on the disk. If the blocks related to such files are not overwritten yet, it will read them and recover the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If blocks of the removed file haven’t been overwritten, this method lets you recover the file completely. And even if overwriting has taken place, the file data can still be found in the journal, or the file will be recovered partially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The algorithm beyond full analysis allows the program to exclude certain elements while searching for deleted data, so the program will rebuild the disk structure and display the deleted files, even if Volume Header and Catalog file have been overwritten partially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nv33LQw2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/o3w7b3yl533mh8k4rqu5.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nv33LQw2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/o3w7b3yl533mh8k4rqu5.png" alt="Image description" width="788" height="596"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, it can be said that HFS+ is an obsolete file system, which has come to exist as the optimized version of an even older file system, HFS. At the moment, HFS+ is replaced by Apple File System.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of performance, safety and reliability, HFS+ fall behind APFS considerably, so the issue of data recovery becomes especially relevant. Information rarely disappears without trace, so knowing well how the file system works, you may hope to recover even the elements initially considered to have been lost for good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello Devs, If you want to become a Data Scientist in 2022 and are curious about which programming language should you learn then you have come to the right place. In the past, I have shared the &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/10/data-science-and-machine-learning-courses-using-python-and-R-programming.html"&gt;best data science courses&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://medium.com/better-programming/top-5-courses-to-learn-python-in-2018-best-of-lot-26644a99e7ec"&gt;best Python courses&lt;/a&gt;, and today, I will tell why learning Python is the best choice for Data Science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to learning Data Science and Machine learning, you have mainly have two programming languages to choose, either use &lt;strong&gt;Python or R&lt;/strong&gt;, but you will find that most Data Scientists and Machine Learning specialists use Python. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about it for quite some time; why Data scientists love Python so much? And what makes Python an absolute choice for Data Science and Machine learning exploration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I set out to research this and read many articles, &lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/6-best-python-books-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-in-2021-2f41d9fbf8be"&gt;books&lt;/a&gt;, and joined Data Science courses with both Python and R to figure out myself and what found was nothing more than surprising. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, it was the simple reason which makes Python than any mystery advantage over R or any other mainstream programming languages like &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/05/top-5-java-courses-for-beginners-to-learn-online.html"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@javinpaul/top-10-courses-to-learn-c-for-beginners-best-and-free-4afc262a544e"&gt;C++&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-ruby-and-rails-courses-to-learn-online.html"&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/06/top-10-courses-to-learn-javascript-in.html"&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python is loved by everyone from beginner to experienced programmers for its simplicity and powerful set of libraries and tools which makes working with data really easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, you can easily cleanse raw data acquired from a survey to create your Machine learning Model using Padas library.  If you try to do the same thing in other programming languages like Java, you will have to write tons of code and it's not as easy as it is in &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/09/5-websites-to-learn-python-for-free.html"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This combination of simplicity, easier learning curve, powerful toolset, and a library make Python the best programming language for Data Science and Machine learning in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, if you already made your mind to learn Data Science with Python and looking for resources where you can learn Data Science with Python programming language, tools, and practices then &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=40328&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fprofessional-certificates%2Fibm-data-science"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IBM Data Science Professional Certificate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Coursera is a great program to start with. This program is specially designed for people who wants to become a Data Scientist in 2022 by learning Python programming language and tools. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=40328&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fprofessional-certificates%2Fibm-data-science"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uftAPoNR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://images.credly.com/images/28944969-813a-43b9-944f-7910111ce764/Professional_Certificate_-_Data_Science.png" alt="Best Data Science Professional Certificate - IBM Training for python developers" width="600" height="600"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let's take a look at all of these reasons in detail before you choose Python to start your Machine Learning and Data Science journey with Python in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-reasons-to-learn-python-for-data-science-in-2022"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5 Reasons to learn Python for Data Science in 2022
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here are the top 5 reasons why Python is so popular among Data Scientists and Machine Learning enthusiasts and why you should learn Python if you want to become a Data Scientist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-pythons-readability-and-simplicity"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Python's readability and simplicity
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main advantages of Python is that it's intuitive and straightforward, and that's what makes it likable for anyone who wants to get a result rather than lost in code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python is also very readable and easy to learn, which means a shallow entry barrier as compared to other programming languages like &lt;a href="https://www.java67.com/2018/09/top-5-free-R-programming-courses-for-Data-Science-Machine-Learning-Programmers.html"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.java67.com/2018/08/top-10-free-java-courses-for-beginners-experienced-developers.html"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-cpp-courses-to-learn-programming.html"&gt;C+&lt;/a&gt;+, which requires a proper environment to be set up to do anything other than running a trivial HelloWorld program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, If you are already convinced that Python is the best programming language for Data Science in 2022 and looking for an online course that teaches you Python from a Data Science point of view then I highly recommend you to join Kirill Erenemko and SuperDataScience Team's &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fpython-coding%2F"&gt;Python A-Z: Python For Data Science With Real Exercises!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  course on Udemy.  This hands-on course is the best course to learn Python for Data Science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fpython-coding%2F"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KTFxr61m--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pPtZfbklaYM/X2LcBqpLFJI/AAAAAAAAjag/xyo6FIQLS78xvFRbUs103DhSAI12eotwACLcBGAsYHQ/s400/Python%252BA-Z%252BPython%252BFor%252BData%252BScience%252BWith%252BReal%252BExercises%252521%252Bbest%252BUdemy%252Bpython%252Bcourse%252Bfor%252Bdata%252Bscience.png" alt="Best Programming language for Data Science - Python" width="400" height="225"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-tools-and-libraries"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Tools and Libraries
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main primary responsibility of Data scientists is to analyze the Data, and in the real-world Data comes in all shapes. They are often raw and not suitable to run any kind of analytics; hence Data wrangling is applied to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a process to clean and transform the data so that you can analyze and model it to create insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python helps Data Scientists here; it comes with so many &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/10/top-8-python-libraries-for-data-science-machine-learning.html"&gt;open-source Python libraries&lt;/a&gt; that can do all these tasks for them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the libraries that are regularly get updated, and all you need to do is use them in your Python scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don't need to &lt;strong&gt;learn how NumPy works&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;how Pandas works&lt;/strong&gt;, as long as you can get your Data clean, apply some mathematical formulas, run some statistical equation you are happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn't that a result-oriented person will like? Well, I certainly do. All you need to learn is how to import a Python module, and you are done. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are curious about which Python module to use for which job, then just Google it, you will find your answers. You don't need to remember which Python libraries I should use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, after working with few scripts, you will automatically get familiar with essential Python libraries for Data Scientists like &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2021/10/top-5-courses-to-learn-numpy-for-python.html"&gt;NumPy&lt;/a&gt;, which stands for Numerical Python, &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/10/top-5-courses-to-learn-pandas-for-data-analysis-python.html"&gt;Pandas&lt;/a&gt;, which is the most critical tool for Data cleanup and Analysis, and &lt;a href="https://matplotlib.org/"&gt;MatPlotLib&lt;/a&gt; for visualizing data, creating charts and generating insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also have &lt;a href="https://becominghuman.ai/top-10-courses-to-learn-tensorflow-for-machine-learning-in-2020-39a31e7cd84b"&gt;TensorFlow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://becominghuman.ai/10-free-courses-to-learn-python-machine-learning-libraries-scikit-learn-numpy-pandas-keras-3c77ba1a6907"&gt;Sci-kit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.java67.com/2020/06/top-5-courses-to-learn-pytorch-and-keras.html"&gt;PyTorch&lt;/a&gt;, which provide some Scientific and Machine learning capability and continuously being enhanced and updated by talented people around the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Facebook has recently added a lot of machine learning capability on &lt;a href="https://www.java67.com/2020/06/top-5-courses-to-learn-pytorch-and-keras.html"&gt;PyTorch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a Data Scientist and Machine learning enthusiast, you don't need to worry about updating libraries, adding new functionalities, etc., as someone else is doing that job for you. You just need to use the library to do your job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcomplete-python-bootcamp%2F"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ycTymrRB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aM0F_MP5BRc/XrQLerBkDvI/AAAAAAAAe28/GvgJH3MBOScr7tsixGVuUGb4ffXkLexKQCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h300/Matplotlib%252BPython%252Bmachine%252Blearning%252Blibrary.png" alt="5 Reasons Why Python is the Best Choice for Machine Learning" width="400" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-jupyter-notebook"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Jupyter Notebook
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason why Data scientists love Python is Jupyter Notebook, which allows you to code and collaborate with other Data Scientists using a web browser. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jupyter Notebook was born from IPython, an interactive command-line terminal for &lt;a href="https://medium.com/swlh/5-free-python-courses-for-beginners-to-learn-online-e1ca90687caf"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since working on the command line is not easy for everyone, they created a powerful web interface to Python and named it Jupyter Notebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jupyter Notebook is an incredibly powerful tool for developing and presenting Data Science projects. IT allows you to integrate code and its output into a single document, combining Visualization, mathematical formulas, and explanations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, most of the online courses I have taken about &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=40328&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fprofessional-certificates%2Fgcp-data-engineering"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine learning on Google Cloud&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Coursera uses Jupyter Notebook for a hands-on example. Because of its impressive capabilities, Jupyter Notebook is very popular among Data Scientists, and it's one of the must-have tools for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=40328&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fprofessional-certificates%2Fgcp-data-engineering"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Iyee2yXa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uUIvheOVCDg/XrQKXxLwy0I/AAAAAAAAe2s/W_EF2C_-sC0GG87lawx6qUFppZjQFw93ACLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h267/Jupytor%252Bnotebook%252Bfor%252Bpython.png" alt="Why Python is the best Programming language for Machine Learninge?" width="397" height="267"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if all these good things are not enough, you would be surprised to know that Jupiter Notebook can also handle R code, which means you can also collaborate with a fellow Data Scientist who is using the &lt;a href="https://becominghuman.ai/top-5-free-courses-to-learn-r-programming-for-data-science-and-statistics-in-2020-305bf1c6f24e"&gt;R programming language&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-community-support"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Community Support
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason which I found behind the popularity of Python among people learning Data Science in the community. Since Python has an active community, and many people are doing &lt;a href="https://becominghuman.ai/5-best-courses-to-learn-pythons-pandas-libary-for-data-analysis-and-data-science-34b62abb0e96"&gt;Data Science using Python&lt;/a&gt;, you already have an active community to call upon when you get stuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also benefit from their work as most of the things are shared as open source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many big organizations like Google and Facebook have contributed to &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/08/top-5-tensorflow-and-machine-learning-courses-online-programmers.html"&gt;TensorFlow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.java67.com/2020/06/top-5-courses-to-learn-pytorch-and-keras.html"&gt;PyTorch&lt;/a&gt;, some of the most popular Python libraries for Data Science and Machine Learning.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-pandas"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Pandas
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an extension of the second point, but Pandas is such an essential tool for Data Scientists that It warrants a special mention. Most of the Data Science project I have worked upon starts with &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/10/top-5-courses-to-learn-pandas-for-data-analysis-python.html"&gt;Pandas&lt;/a&gt; and finishes with it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It not only allows you to clean and massage your Data but also to analyze the data. You can load data from various data sources like CSV files, &lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/7-best-microsoft-excel-courses-for-beginners-33a069708680"&gt;Excel&lt;/a&gt;, Databases, and many other sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pandas contain a large variety of functions for data import, export, indexing, and data manipulation. It also provides a handy data structure like DataFrames (a series of rows and columns) and Series (1-dimensional array)and efficient methods for handling them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, you can use Pandas to reshape, merge, split, and aggregate data. In short, Pandas is an indispensable tool for Data Scientists along with the Jupyter Notebook. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn Pandas better, I also recommend you to check out the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fdata-analysis-with-pandas%2F"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Analysis with Python and Pandas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; course on Udemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fdata-analysis-with-pandas%2F"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5uUVwNp3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-F4X0t8fxAQ4/XqglDUHnACI/AAAAAAAAeoU/uEXonnv3rfk5UotxkKBxY8NpQuz-_9oKQCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h225/Data%252BAnalysis%252Bwith%252BPandas%252Band%252BPython%252BUdemy%252Bcourse.jpg" alt="why python is the best programming language for machine learning" width="400" height="225"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming back to the topic, because of all these excellent tools, frameworks, libraries, and simplicity of the Python programming language, Data Scientists love Python and continue to love it.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, here are &lt;strong&gt;5 main reasons why Python is the most popular and best programming language&lt;/strong&gt; for Data Science and Machine Learning&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Python is Simple and Intuitive.&lt;br&gt;
2. Jupyter Notebook allows Data scientists to collaborate and combine cod and output.&lt;br&gt;
3. Python packages and libraries like &lt;a href="https://www.java67.com/2021/11/top-5-free-courses-to-learn-numpy-for.html"&gt;NumPy&lt;/a&gt; and Pandas help with data cleanup and Analysis.&lt;br&gt;
4. Community support&lt;br&gt;
5. Pandas&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you still have doubts, here is a chart from IBM's survey about the most popular programming language for Machine learning from the last couple of years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a bit old, but it shows a clear trend that Python is way ahead with mainstream programming language like Java, C++, JavaScript when it comes to Data Science and Machine learning&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's all about &lt;strong&gt;why Python is the most popular programming language for Data Science and Machine learning&lt;/strong&gt;. I am also from the same camp. I did try R but not more than a couple of days. Why? Because I wanted to spend my time on something which I can use in places other than Data Science, and on that parameter, Python is well ahead with R.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you also think that &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/05/why-python-is-best-programming-language.html"&gt;Python is the best Programming language for Data Science&lt;/a&gt;, here are some courses you may want to checkout to learn Python from the Data Scientist point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Documenting versus fixing</title>
      <author>Berislav Babic</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 07:41:45 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/berislavbabic/documenting-versus-fixing-1epd</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/berislavbabic/documenting-versus-fixing-1epd</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you would rather have something properly documented than fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In engineering, documentation is crucial although we don't like to think about it. Documenting the processes, implementations, architecture, problems that we encountered and the ways we solved them helps a lot in the future. Not only to the people that will have to work on the things you worked on, but also to yourself since you will most likely forget what you worked on 6 months ago. Having the ability to look up the reason &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; something was done the way it was done is priceless. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I listened to the &lt;a href="https://rubyrogues.com/common-table-expressions-in-activerecord-ft-vlado-cingel-ruby-523"&gt;Ruby Rogues&lt;/a&gt; podcast after a long while, and the main reason is that my friend &lt;a href="https://github.com/vlado"&gt;Vlado&lt;/a&gt; was a guest on it with his cool and useful gem called &lt;a href="https://github.com/vlado/activerecord-cte"&gt;activerecord-cte&lt;/a&gt;. One of the hosts said something like this: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want an engineering team to fix any sort of outstanding issue, give them a choice to either fix the issue at hand or document it so it can be fixed later. Engineering will fix it in no time given that option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This quote rings so true to me, since the detachment between wanting to document something and digging in to fix it is huge. The best “documenters” I met were people that originated from support, and I understood their willingness to document stuff as much as possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you tried working in support for just a week, you would understand why they value good documentation above all other things. It is so much easier to link an article or a how-to document when a hundredth customer asks you the same question over and over again. It saves a lot of time for these agents and removes a lot of confusion because you might recite something different every other time someone asks you (or even forget stuff). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have this great anecdote in engineering where we explain the problem to a coworker, or if we lack coworkers, we can explain it to a rubber duck. Just the process of explaining the issue increases our own understanding of the issue, and usually brings out a solution while we are explaining it. Whiteboards can help in solving problems by drawing them out and giving a bigger perspective. This has worked wonders for me personally whenever I faced a hard-to-solve issue that sat there unsolved for what seemed like ages. Though we do not need to document every bug that happens, as I already mentioned, &lt;a href="https://berislavbabic.com/the-value-of-a-great-post-mortem/"&gt;incident post-mortems&lt;/a&gt; are a great way to understand what happened and how we can learn from it to prevent it from happening in the future. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_by_teaching"&gt;Learning by teaching&lt;/a&gt; is the best way to learn in my opinion because the more you teach, more you learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want your code to last, you have to make sure people want to work on it and it's hard to work on something you don't understand. Documentation, specifications, and inline docs all add to the readability and understandability of the code at hand. If you lack one of them it's okay, but if you lack all of them, it will  be very hard to persuade people to work on your project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.whitenoise.email/"&gt;Tom White&lt;/a&gt; for reviewing and helping me improve this post.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Five Laptop Problems You Can Expect to Encounter</title>
      <author>Sajal Manjhi</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 07:37:47 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/sajalmanjhi/five-laptop-problems-you-can-expect-to-encounter-3l60</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/sajalmanjhi/five-laptop-problems-you-can-expect-to-encounter-3l60</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After purchasing a laptop, you expect to have a performing device that will not run into various issues. This might be true early on, but a laptop is no different from other similar devices. It is only a matter of time before you experience performance problems and struggle to work on the laptop efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, a lot depends on how much effort you are putting into the computer’s maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Purchasing a second-hand laptop to save money is also worth mentioning, as used laptops are more prone to problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing what to expect and how to counter the problem is one way to circumvent potential issues before they snowball. Let’s take a look at common laptop problems and cover methods to deal with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#loud-noises"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Loud Noises
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loud noises coming from a laptop are not a good sign, particularly when you are not running resource-heavy applications. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you want to do is to check the situation with the dust inside. If you have been using the laptop for a while and never bothered cleaning the dust inside, it is possible that too much of it has accumulated over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cleaning the dust should solve loud noises and overheating. In case you are reluctant to do the work yourself because taking a laptop apart is too risky, leave it to an experienced computer service worker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case removing the dust does little and the internal fans still struggle to cool the laptop and are overworked, consider getting a cooling pad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#unresponsive-keyboard-keys"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Unresponsive Keyboard Keys
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, a laptop’s keyboard should function properly so long as you take care of the computer. However, there are times when one or multiple keys become unresponsive or difficult to click.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most likely reason is something stuck inside the keyboard, such as food particles. A worn-out key is also one of the possibilities, though it is less likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replacing individual keyboard keys can be tricky for a laptop because you might not find the right key separately. Purchasing an external keyboard does not sound like a decent option either because of the money you would need to spend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try cleaning the keyboard and see if it fixes it. If not, you will need to take one of the two options mentioned in the previous paragraph. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#battery-drain"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Battery Drain
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with fast battery drain is that you cannot really prevent it after a while. A laptop’s battery will start to underperform eventually, and what you can really do at that point is to take some measures to slow the drainage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep an eye on background processes. If you notice a random application running for no reason, quit it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, avoid cluttering the desktop with random shortcuts and documents. Not only do desktop icons take more from the battery, but they also put a toll on the system since it has to render each icon when users switch between the desktop and other tabs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, avoid having the charger cable plugged when the battery is at 100 percent. Overcharging is also a common cause behind the poor battery lifespan problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#screen-flickers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Screen Flickers
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Random screen flickers might not feel like a significant issue if they are not too frequent. On the other hand, the fact that this problem exists in the first place is an indication that there is something wrong with the laptop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, once you notice screen flickers, expect that the frequency will only increase with time if you do not solve the problem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More often than not, a laptop’s screen starts to flicker because the GPU becomes incompatible with the operating system. In case you noticed the issue after installing an OS update, try going back to a previous operating system version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the solution does not work, you will need to seek help from a computer service store. Laptop screens require knowledge to fix, and tinkering with them without the necessary experience will only make the problem worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#audio-problems"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Audio Problems
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Audio issues range from scuffed sound quality to unresponsive microphones and no audio at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internal speakers should function, and it is common to connect external speakers or headphones for better sound quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if the audio problems, you should start by checking whether you have given permissions to applications. Some software asks to access the system audio to operate properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tinkering with sound settings is also worth a shout. Sometimes, the settings get all over the place and even get disabled. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, you should be more careful with how you use a laptop. A proper maintenance routine is one of the best ways to prevent potential issues from ruining the device’s performance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, some problems are more or less inevitable, and it is necessary to know how you can deal with them. And if not, you still have the option to rely on a computer service store&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Native vs Cross-Platform Development: Pros &amp; Cons</title>
      <author>Fora Soft</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 07:37:46 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/forasoft/native-vs-cross-platform-development-pros-cons-o6o</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/forasoft/native-vs-cross-platform-development-pros-cons-o6o</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whenever you create an iOS application, the question you ask first is usually “do I have to develop a native solution using &lt;strong&gt;Swift&lt;/strong&gt; or go with a cross-platform app?”. You will be able to answer this question, as well as understand the advantages and disadvantages of the both options, after reading this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#short-description-of-crossplatform-solutions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Short description of cross-platform solutions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;React Native&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Facebook created and supports this platform. React Native helps develop cross-platform mobile apps on JavaScript. With that being said, developers are free to use up to 70% of the code between different platforms, such as iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flutter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Flutter is a young yet promising platform. It has attracted attention from big companies that developed their apps. Flutter’s simplicity is comparable with web applications, and its speed is equal to that of native apps’. The programming language that goes with Flutter is Dart, which compiles into a binary code. That allows operation speed to be comparable to Swift’s and Objective-C’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xamarin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Xamarin is a framework for cross-platform mobile application development, which uses the C# language. Microsoft bought Xamarin in 2016, made the source code of Xamarin SDK open, and included it into IDE Microsoft Visual Studio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#short-description-of-native-solutions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Short description of native solutions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective-C&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Objective-C used to be the main language of development for iOS until not so long ago. This language is a superset of C, that’s why the compiler Objective-C fully understands C-code. Therefore, an app created with Objective-C can be very fast. Objective-C also has object-oriented programming, which helps make programs that you can easily scale in the future if needed. However, this language is quite old. Stepstone created it in the 1980s. Apple, on the other hand, is a very progressive company, so it wasn’t a huge surprise when they introduced a new programming language in 2014 – Swift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swift&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Swift is a language that allows writing applications for phones, desktop computers, and servers. The compiler is optimized for productivity, and the language is optimized for development, with no compromises from each side. Swift has years of development behind it, and it’s still moving forward, constantly learning new opportunities. When it was just released, the community split into two parts. The first one believed that there was nothing better than Objective-C. The second one rooted for Swift and tried to use it to create apps. Now, after several years of development, it’s safe to say that when it comes to creating iOS apps, Swift is language #1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#advantages-and-disadvantages-of-crossplatform-solutions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Advantages and disadvantages of cross-platform solutions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of writing an app for iOS and Android simultaneously does draw attention to itself. However, nothing is perfect.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Advantages:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Simplicity&lt;/strong&gt;. Choose between JavaScript, C#, or Dart as the main programming language. More developers can work with those, which will simplify the development process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Speed and cost of development&lt;/strong&gt;. You only need one team of developers to create an app that will look the same on both iOS and Android. When you need to create an app for the both platforms quickly, this becomes a substantial advantage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Safety&lt;/strong&gt;. Almost all cross-platform solutions have an open source code, and any thief who knows how to program can look at it, find the weak spots, and hack your app. It’s also important that a cross-platform app connects with the backend via usual HTTP-calls, and thieves can easily intercept your data and use it for their advantage (read more about it &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/why-is-http-not-secure/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The difficulty of work with iOS native functions&lt;/strong&gt;. Swift developers have integrated useful modules into the language. You can work with audio, video, phone camera, location, Bluetooth with those modules. When developing a cross-platform app, the work with these functions is more difficult. For example, to add an AR-object on a video from a camera or demonstrate a screen during an online call, you need to develop additional modules. It increases the time spent on developing, making it more expensive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Speed and interface responsiveness&lt;/strong&gt;. When an app that shows some data (for example, an online shop or a newsfeed) is developed, the speed of a cross-platform app is equal to a native one, but it will often be lower. If your app supports calls, video chats, AR, it works even slower compared to a native app. Users won’t like it if they miss half of what their interlocutor was speaking about, or if they are unable to catch their favorite Pokemon due to low interface responsiveness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#advantages-and-disadvantages-of-native-solutions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Advantages and disadvantages of native solutions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to research conducted by &lt;a href="https://armadsen.micro.blog/2019/02/16/how-many-apps.html"&gt;Andrew Madsen’s blog&lt;/a&gt;, out of 79 most popular non-game applications in the App Store, about 53% are written in Swift, and the other 47% don’t use Swift. It’s important to mention that somebody from that 47% can be using Objective-C, which is a native language, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also research by &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/869224/worldwide-software-developer-working-hours/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20survey,%2042,mobile%20developers%20use%20native%20tools"&gt;statista.com&lt;/a&gt;, which says that ⅔ of all apps are native, for both Android and iOS. Why is that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;All peculiarities of a platform are considered&lt;/strong&gt;. No doubt that developing an app for the both platform at the same time is convenient, but each one of them is individual. Requirements for safety, interface design, and payment system integration differ. For example, system elements that iOS and Android have are absolutely different (the example is on the image below). The user expects to see elements familiar to the platform.
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FoSWHRFK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3bvfwrrlt25ts8cjisha.png" alt="Image description" width="685" height="362"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Speed and interface responsiveness&lt;/strong&gt;. Native-written apps work faster. It’s a lot more convenient for a user to use an app where the animation is smooth, touching buttons is processed instantly, and they can scroll the screen without freezes, while quickly loading content. It is very important as people are actively using apps nowadays to go shopping, visit doctors, attend business meetings. No one would want their screen to freeze in the moment of payment or during important meetings. These things can make the user look for an alternative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;No obstacles to updating apps or widen their functionality&lt;/strong&gt;. Platforms evolve, they add new functions, and apps must support them. An iOS update can completely break an application. Unless cross-platform app developers release a new version, the app may not be working, and there is nothing you can do about it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Access to own functions and private API platforms&lt;/strong&gt;. Swift developers have integrated useful modules into the apps, as we’ve mentioned earlier. Whenever you want to create an app with online conferences, AR, or sharing via Bluetooth (push ads upon entering a Bluetooth tracker area or money transfer in bank apps), the developers won’t have to create these modules themselves, which saves time and money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Safety&lt;/strong&gt;. The source code of operating systems and native ways of development is closed. Gaining access to it is impossible, unlike cross-platform apps with an open source code that anyone can access.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You need to create two applications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You then need to support these two applications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cross-platform and native ways of development have advantages and disadvantages to them. There is no multi-purpose tool that will be better everywhere. When choosing development tools, take an app type, app’s and platform’s peculiarities, your money, and goals into consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;strong&gt;go for a cross-platform solution&lt;/strong&gt;, if you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are limited in time and money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need your app to look the same on all platforms, despite their peculiarities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t need your app to use platform-specific functions like working with the phone camera, difficult animations, photo and video editing, Bluetooth, online calls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t require your app to be extremely safe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples:&lt;/strong&gt; news apps, pizza ordering apps, a beauty salon registering apps, online shops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, &lt;strong&gt;go for native tools&lt;/strong&gt; if your app:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is supported during a long period of time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses a phone camera, difficult animations, Bluetooth, video and audio calls, streams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requires support for new platform functionality after the platform update&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has different design on different platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looks the way the platform guidelines recommend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is demanding to safety&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requires high speed of work and interface responsiveness, however new and powerful a device is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples&lt;/strong&gt;: e-learning, medicine, internet TV, video chats, video surveillance, augmented reality.&lt;/p&gt;
