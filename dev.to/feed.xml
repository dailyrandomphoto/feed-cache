      <title>Swapping Tokens on MetaMask</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;MetaMask, one of the most popular Ethereum-based crypto wallets offers the ability to swap a crypto token with another, seamlessly. We can do that either by using the built-in swap feature within the wallet app, or manually by using any DEX platform such as Uniswap or Pancakeswap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#using-the-builtin-swap-feature"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Using the built-in swap feature
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IGoJilQc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bo392dxlybibghvp3io3.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IGoJilQc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bo392dxlybibghvp3io3.jpeg" alt="1_uy-1VbHPw8vJd62lIqgGvA"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To swap a token using the swap feature on MetaMask, we'll need to follow these simple steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the MetaMask extension&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the new ‘Swap’ button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the tokens you want to swap and click ‘Get quotes’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let MetaMask do its magic ;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compare all available quotes and select the best one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on ‘Swap’ and wait until the transaction completes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#manually-using-a-dex"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Manually using a DEX
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To manually swap tokens using MetaMask, we can use a DEX such as Uniswap or Pancakeswap. Let's walk down the steps on how to do it with Pancakeswap. These steps would be pretty much the same on most DEX platforms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-fire-up-your-browser-and-visit-pancakeswapfinance"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Fire up your browser and visit pancakeswap.finance
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fBa2Pvx5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vmls4pr4uymofbi6yj6n.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fBa2Pvx5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vmls4pr4uymofbi6yj6n.png" alt="pancakeswap"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then click on &lt;code&gt;Trade &amp;gt; Exchange&lt;/code&gt; from the menu at the left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7Rv9mZMA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ekv1dumg4qfvlcwlyq1n.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7Rv9mZMA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ekv1dumg4qfvlcwlyq1n.png" alt="Screenshot from 2021-07-27 16-24-46"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-click-on-connect-at-the-top-right-corner"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Click on 'Connect' at the top right corner
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensure that you're signed into your MetaMask wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ov8-4Qqk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/neti5fsytdewbtx6ro2j.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ov8-4Qqk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/neti5fsytdewbtx6ro2j.png" alt="Screenshot from 2021-07-27 16-24-46"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-select-metamask-from-the-list-of-supported-wallets"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Select 'MetaMask' from the list of supported wallets
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZFtaAFRP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mrx8j5wgae4cli68e3dm.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZFtaAFRP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mrx8j5wgae4cli68e3dm.png" alt="Screenshot from 2021-07-27 16-24-46"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-select-the-account-you-want-to-connect-and-click-next"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Select the account you want to connect and click 'Next'
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--oVAGQIu2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tad9gv0tbk9vaq4nazze.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--oVAGQIu2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tad9gv0tbk9vaq4nazze.png" alt="Screenshot from 2021-07-27 16-26-00"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-select-the-tokens-you-want-to-swap-in-the-from-and-to-section-and-click-swap"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Select the tokens you want to swap in the 'From' and 'To' section, and click 'Swap'
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Zz96_ysx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nq57oe24scll8hd9nusb.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Zz96_ysx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nq57oe24scll8hd9nusb.png" alt="Screenshot from 2021-07-27 16-24-46"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-confirm-the-transaction-from-your-wallet"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. Confirm the transaction from your wallet
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OqZOaCN3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9gk39qyg0fkk1vyxfz7m.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OqZOaCN3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9gk39qyg0fkk1vyxfz7m.png" alt="Screenshot from 2021-07-27 16-27-54"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And voila! Your transaction is submitted. You can view the status of your transaction on BSCScan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bzXKePCG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zarjgpfb90afabagv29z.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bzXKePCG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zarjgpfb90afabagv29z.png" alt="9vw40kseg2p61"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure that you've added the token's contract in your MetaMask wallet so that it shows up after the swap! &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Top 10 Podcasts for Python in 2021</title>
      <author>Kat Holder</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 14:16:08 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/katholder/top-10-podcasts-for-python-in-2021-14h0</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/katholder/top-10-podcasts-for-python-in-2021-14h0</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Python is one of the most popular, easy, and versatile programming languages among developers. And amusingly, it has a community that teems with podcasts choices that the developer is confused about which one to choose, so here is an attempt to compile the best &lt;b&gt;Podcasts for Python&lt;/b&gt; that are out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python is a comprehensible English-like syntax that is quite friendly with beginners. It has fast pace delivery with adaptable solutions to a diverse range of industries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internet contains vast resources to learn Python, some of them would be the online MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses), websites, YouTube channels, and the ever-growing area of podcasts. Podcasts come quite handy when you are multitasking and can learn at your own pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog, it would be an attempt to cover the podcasts from the whole range of skill sets an emerging to a seasoned developer would require. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Podcasts for Python in 2021&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://realpython.com/podcasts/rpp/"&gt;The Real Python Podcast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hosted by Christopher Bailey weekly that provides you with interviews, coding tips, and conversations with guests from the Python community. It has received rave reviews from all types of developers. One of the feedback involves how one of the episodes on Python packaging helped a beginner to understand and reach the desired tutorials that helped him build his first Python package.Also Could Read the &lt;a href="https://codersera.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-python/"&gt;Beginner’s Guide To Python &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also appreciated for the copious notes it provides along with the recommendations to sync in your understanding of the language. It has been in the market since 2012 and has an outstanding reach of 91.2K followers on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://talkpython.fm/"&gt;Talk Python To Me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a weekly &lt;b&gt;podcast&lt;/b&gt; hosted by Michael Kennedy. It has a format of 45 minutes where industry experts are invited to speak on a wide array of topics related to Python and interlinked to it. With the success of this podcast, they have also launched a second one. Deemed to be the counterpart of the long format of the first one, this one- Python Bytes- delivers on the topical items in a fifteen-minute conversation to the listener. It is co-hosted by Brian Okken.&lt;br&gt;
Another remarkable thing about this podcast is the range of courses it provides you on an individual level. The courses vary from a beginner to a seasoned developer to the requirements of an entrepreneur to building projects using APIs.&lt;br&gt;
It has been in the community since 2015 and has voluminous followership of 44K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pythonpodcast.com/"&gt;Podcastinit__&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A podcast with a followership of 8.8K, it is led by the brilliant Tobias Macey. A product of the technical Operational lead at MIT’s Open Learning Programme. It works with the mantra of one size fits all. No matter where you're coming from, what field of IT you are into, this must be one of the most helpful podcasts that bounds to be on your list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It covers all the challenges, use cases, and the motivation that went into making the software that you are using and making this accessible from the horse’s mouth. It has a format of 30 minutes and covers dynamic topics related to Web Applications. Scientific Research, DevOps, Data Science, and much more.&lt;br&gt;
One of their latest topics- Episode 323- explores The SpeechBrain Toolkit for Speech Processing. It is a definite click with the increase in the rise in automation, this episode accommodates how we need high-quality libraries to generate and process audio data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://anchor.fm/profitablepythonfm"&gt;Profitable Python&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launched in 2019, it is hosted by Ben McNeill. The &lt;b&gt;podcast&lt;/b&gt; has an interview style that offers a host of significant Python-based content that developers end up dabbling within their day-to-day life. These include tutorials, tips, real-life examples and help you speed with Python. The major topics covered in the podcast include Data Science, Machine Learning, frameworks like Django, and much more. &lt;br&gt;
It has recorded 110 episodes and it also branches to discussing mentorship guidelines amidst the career and programming tips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.teachingpython.fm/"&gt;Teaching Python&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is my personal favorite- a podcast run by two passionate, adventurous, and outstanding people sharing their experience of teaching middle school computer science, program-solving, and life lessons of taking frustration and failure through the lens of the Python programming language. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kelly Paredes has remarkable experience in teaching with a specialization in curriculum design and development. She teaches at the Pine Crest School in Florida while Sean Tibor has vast experience in marketing and technical management roles. Both of them have three years of experience in teaching Python to seventh and eighth-graders at the same school in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is quite open-ended as the length of the podcasts ranges from 20 minutes to an hour and a half. They don’t follow a fixed timeline and we would recommend you to follow them on social media to keep yourself updated when the next episode will turn up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="%20https://testandcode.com/"&gt;Test and Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A weekly podcast hosted by Brian Okken. This show covers a wide range of topics that might include software engineering, testing, &lt;b&gt;Python programming&lt;/b&gt;, and many related topics. Hosted by Brian Okken, it was launched in 2015. This podcast will be a great fit for you if you are especially interested in software testing, and specifically Python programming and testing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The duration of these episodes vary from 30 minutes to an hour and has an interview-style like format. Along with that, the topics covered in the podcast are language-neutral. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://djangoriffs.com/"&gt;Django Riffs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a podcast that helps you learn web application development in Python using the Django web framework. Its episodes discuss how you write tests for your Django apps and verify how your site can work and continue to work. Along with that, there is an episode that discusses the role of static files in your application. This podcast provides a new take on Python, give it a go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8yMDNkNG/"&gt;Mid Meet Py&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one meets in the middle of the week to talk and chat about Python. As it labels itself, it is designed by “Pythonistas for Pythonistas”. The podcast includes various conversations with Lemon Sanfoy, one of the owners of Python discord to other members in the community related to its various libraries and this ever-dynamic language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/in/podcast/early-access-pycharm/id1524964994%5C"&gt;Early Access PyCharm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a podcast that goes behind the scenes of discussing how the PYCharm IDE is made and what type of motivation the creative thinking process went into making it one. PyCharm is a Python IDE from JetBrains. &lt;br&gt;
It covers a range of topics and talks about the interlinking it shares with Data Science, the Web, and Django just to name a few. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pythonoutloud.com"&gt;Python Out Loud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hosted by Kevin Chang and Isaiah Lankham, this podcast talks to a beginner and a seasoned developer and walks in casual discussions about &lt;b&gt;Python&lt;/b&gt; and the problem-solving aspect of it at the same time. &lt;br&gt;
The names of their episodes are quirky enough for you to give it a click and enjoy them as they dabble with the further specificities of the language. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Wrapping Up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tell us about your interesting take on these podcasts in the comment section below. Podcasts have gained new popularity in the Gen Z era where we are growing more accustomed to listen to topics and information related to what interests us.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Placements Journey</title>
      <author>Manvi Tyagi</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 14:09:48 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/manvityagi9/my-placements-journey-4m0g</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/manvityagi9/my-placements-journey-4m0g</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This article is all about my placements journey. I have cleared interviews and got offers from Microsoft, Twitter, Amazon, PayPal, Cisco and a couple more. I am sharing my interview experiences not only for these companies but for all the companies where I was rejected too - Google, Sharechat, Atlan, Postman, Amazon. And the reason for that is - "You can't do all the mistakes by yourselves to learn from them, A wise person learns from the mistakes of others." I have shared my mistakes and learnings from different interviews, hopefully it will be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a final year student from a Tier-3 college (and it really doesn't matter), but I have to mention it because so many juniors are worried about this fact and I wanna make clear that - "Accept whatever you got and work towards your goal, Tier-3 College Tag won't block your ways if you upskill enough".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the experiences would cover the following details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Timeline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did I apply&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interview Process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My Learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's just start then - &lt;br&gt;
Also, Don't get demotivated by my repeated rejections, We will move towards the good things gradually :p&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WF3Fm1Ga--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fg4eph9oejg4a73s4k9g.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WF3Fm1Ga--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fg4eph9oejg4a73s4k9g.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First interview of 4th year. Though not the desired role or package, but my confidence was boosted after clearing all the rounds.&lt;br&gt;
A lengthy process and not for SDE Role too so I am not penning it down here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#amazon-rejected"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AMAZON - REJECTED
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Rejected in this round itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Learning&lt;/strong&gt;: 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn't manage my time well, spent too much time on 1st question due to which couldn't code the 2nd within the given time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was pretty bad at explaining, interviewing just doesn't mean solving a question on silent mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#postman-rejected"&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Process&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online Coding Test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1st F2F Round: &lt;strong&gt;JavaScript, Computer Networks, Databases, Resume Projects&lt;/strong&gt;. All these were asked in great detail, cross-question from each answer, deep dive into all questions. Some questions that I remember: SSL Verification Process, many confusing questions around &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; in JavaScript, How HTTP and HTTPs connections are established, questions around working of NodeJS etc. I was rejected after this round itself. No DSA asked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FYI, 2 more F2F Rounds were expected if I had cleared the previous round.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Learning&lt;/strong&gt;: Till now, I was majorly focusing on DSA, with this interview, I realized, I need to thoroughly study all CS Subject Fundamentals and just reading Top 50 interview Questions of OS before the interview isn't gonna work :p&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#google-rejected"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  GOOGLE - REJECTED
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Role&lt;/strong&gt;: Software Developer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Timeline&lt;/strong&gt;: Applied in August, Interviewed in September&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Applied through&lt;/strong&gt;: Careers Site (With referral)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Process&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 On-site Rounds(4 tech + 1 Googlyness) were to be scheduled. First 3 on Day 1 and remaining 2 only if the feedback from previous 3 rounds was positive. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Interview Day&lt;/strong&gt;: I was already quite nervous. In the first interview, 2 questions were asked, I solved both, one with expected time and space complexity but for the other question, the interviewer expected a more optimised solution. I sat for the 2nd interview with increased nervousness, only 1 question was asked, which I solved and coded but again the interviewer pushed for a more optimized approach. By this time, I knew that I have lost this chance and with no expectations, sat for the 3rd Round, this time I solved and coded the solution with best possible complexity, covered all edge cases etc. and the interviewer seemed happy with my performance.
&lt;strong&gt;Topics of questions - DP, Binary Search, Graph, Hashmap&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got a feedback call within the same week from the recruiter and I was rejected once again. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning&lt;/strong&gt;: After this interview, I could clearly see the areas I needed to work on. The rejection and feedback from Google instead of demotivating me, lifted my spirits. I got 1 YES and 2 NOs from the 3 rounds, but the good thing was that even the 2 interviewers sent this feedback "She was way too near the optimization needed, it was a matter of some more minutes, and She would have solved it." They also told me my strong points along with where I lacked. I clearly knew that I needed to work more on Speed and Problem Solving Skills and I definitely started on it soon after this interview by giving more and more live contests and upsolving them regularly on Codeforces, atcoder, Leetcode, Codechef(short-only), binarysearch.io. &lt;br&gt;
Another big takeaway was giving interviews with a calm mind and confidence. My nervousness really slowed down my brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sharechat-rejected"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  SHARECHAT - REJECTED
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Role&lt;/strong&gt;: Frontend Intern&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Timeline&lt;/strong&gt;: Applied and Interviewed in September&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Applied through&lt;/strong&gt;: A google form was all around. I just filled it and got the test link.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online Coding Test(3 questions)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DSA Round(elimination round): 2 questions(&lt;strong&gt;Topics - Graph and Hashmap&lt;/strong&gt;) were asked, complete optimised, running, clean, bug-free code was expected for both. I performed quite good in this round. Interviewer seemed impressed. After a couple of hours, recruiter called and informed that I have my next round the next day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frontend Dev Round(elimination round): HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS - This round revolved around these things only. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within the same week, I got the rejection mail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Little more background&lt;/strong&gt;: This was the 3rd time in the same year itself, that I received test link from Sharechat. First time, for Backend Intern Role(Out of 3, solved 2 questions completely and 1 partially, didn't get interview call), 2nd time for SDE Intern Role(solved all 3 questions completely, still didn't get interview call), 3rd time for Frontend Intern Role(solved all 3 questions completely, and got interview call this time). Now the sad thing at that time was that I had not been into frontend development at all, Backend Development was where both my skills and interest lied, but I thought that I will practice some frontend before the interviews. Now a more sad thing was that the interviews were scheduled just in a couple of days -- on the same day, my 3 google interviews were scheduled :P. As a result, I couldn't prepare anything for the frontend round. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, I was happy after performing good in DSA Round. Bad performance in frontend dev round didn't affect me because I hadn't prepared for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#atlan-rejected"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ATLAN - REJECTED
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Role&lt;/strong&gt;: Backend Intern&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Timeline&lt;/strong&gt;: Applied in July, Interviewed in September&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Applied through&lt;/strong&gt;: Careers Site(without referral), the application form was lengthy and asked about many things including - projects, open source contributions etc. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Process&lt;/strong&gt;: 

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Project Submission&lt;/strong&gt;: They gave a problem statement, I had to build a solution(Android App or Website). I enjoyed making this project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1st F2F Round&lt;/strong&gt;: No DSA again, Many questions around the project I submitted in the previous round. Some questions revolved around &lt;strong&gt;scalability approaches, system design basics, reliability and failure&lt;/strong&gt; in big projects. I answered most of the questions. And the interviewer seemed quite happy. There were some questions like - http multipart request, MySQL master slave replication that I couldn't answer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Result&lt;/strong&gt;: This time I wasn't expecting rejection, but who cares about expectations, I was again rejected with a message that my past-experiences, projects, stack doesn't suit the requirement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Learning&lt;/strong&gt;: Stop expecting, You can get rejected even after you feel you did good. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#innovaccer-ppo"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  INNOVACCER - PPO
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little good news in September, I received Pre Placement Offer from Innovaccer, where I did my summer intern. For the interview experience and process refer my other &lt;a href="https://manvityagi770.medium.com/innovaccer-interview-experience-2d0808b50b0d"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-break-that-i-took-from-interviewing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A Break that I took from Interviewing
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was tired by this point, for some or the other reason, I was getting rejected again and again. I was working on my weak areas, analysing for each interview, why I couldn't make it and improving on those things. But every interview gave me a new reason of rejection. &lt;br&gt;
The companies that I have listed above are only the ones I got interview calls from, Leave alone the companies where I applied and didn't get a reply and the companies from where I received test link but didn't get interview calls(2 cases here - For some, I didn't perform well enough in the tests, for some I didn't get interview call even after solving the tests completely). &lt;br&gt;
I stopped applying to any companies at this point and just practiced more for around 1.5 months silently. No LinkedIn, No interviews, only coding and brushing fundamentals again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cisco-selected"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  CISCO - SELECTED
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Role&lt;/strong&gt;: SDE Intern&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Timeline&lt;/strong&gt;: Applied in July, interviewed in November. I had totally forgotten that I even applied here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Applied through&lt;/strong&gt;: Careers Site(with Referral).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Process&lt;/strong&gt;:

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online Test: 2 Coding Questions and MCQs. Only Java, Python and C were allowed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1st Technical Round(60 mins): 2 Coding Questions

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1st question's optimization was based on using a linear String Matching Algo in one part of the algorithm, I implemented KMP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2nd question was to check whether a graph is a tree.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write pseudo code for Semaphore Working&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many questions from Operating Systems - Threads, Processes, Memory Management etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2nd Technical Round(45 mins): 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on CS Fundamentals and Resume&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OS, DBMS, CN, REST API Design, Questions around my projects and skills that I mentioned in my resume&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HR Round:
This was more of a formality, They informed about the stipend, duration etc and asked some questions like Why Cisco etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a couple of days, I received the selection mail 🎉&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: All rounds were eliminatory rounds and were conducted on the same day with a gap of couple of hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Learning&lt;/strong&gt; - This was kind of my first success at interviews and I realized that a calm mind without any expectations helped me during the interview. This was also the first time, I was not nervous before the interviews, Why? This time I had tailored my mind with - "कर्म किए जा फल की इच्छा मत कर", in English - "Do your duty without thinking about results". Before the interviews, I just told myself to talk to the guys, solve the questions they ask and chill. And that helped :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#paypal-selected"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  PAYPAL - SELECTED
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Role&lt;/strong&gt;: SDE Intern&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Timeline&lt;/strong&gt;: I applied around August and got test link in November and had interviews in December.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Applied through&lt;/strong&gt;: Careers Site(without Referral). University Recruitment was probably the name of this hiring event.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Process&lt;/strong&gt;:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online Test: 3 Coding Questions. The most interesting questions that I got in any test till now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1st Technical Round(45 mins):

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trapping Rain Water Problem, Its a Leetcode Hard Problem. Complete optimised code was expected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asked me to explain the approach of the 2 questions from the online round and asked if I had any other approaches to solve them. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 Puzzles. It was fun solving them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2nd Technical Round(30 mins): 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on CS Fundamentals and Resume&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The interviewer asked me to introduce myself along with the work that I have done in my previous internships or any projects that I wanted to discuss. She cross-questioned meanwhile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The interviewer was clearly impressed with my answers and overall profile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managerial Round:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This Round taught me to never be overconfident. I always thought that HR Rounds are a piece of cake for me, so I never really prepared or even thought about them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The interviewer asked me many questions about myself - my aspirations, my principles of life, some situation based questions, my weaknesses, and many more and To be honest, I didn’t really feel good after the interview, I thought he is not gonna select me because, during the interview, he focused on my weaknesses a lot, most of his questions revolved around my weaknesses, it’s like I couldn’t even tell one of my profile/work highlights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a couple of days, I received the selection mail 🎉. I joined PayPal and after the internship received a full-time offer from them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: All rounds were eliminatory rounds and were conducted on different days.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning&lt;/strong&gt; -  Most interviewers are very supportive and encouraging. Speaking with confidence and putting up a happy face instead of a scared one transmits good vibes across.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#amazon-selected"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AMAZON - SELECTED
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Role&lt;/strong&gt;: Software Development Engineer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Timeline&lt;/strong&gt;: Applied in January, Interviewed in March&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Applied through&lt;/strong&gt;: Careers Site(with Referral).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Process&lt;/strong&gt;:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online Test: 2 Coding Questions and MCQs(Quant, Reasoning, English, Personality). I found it easy as compared to other tests I had given.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1st Technical Round(60 mins): 2 Coding Questions

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rotten Oranges Variant(a Leetcode Medium Question)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A question based on Topological Sort&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2nd Technical Round(60 mins): 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graph Question - Used Djisktra Algo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DP Question (I don't remember the question)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bar Raiser Round(this was probably the name):

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A mix of everything that is asked in interviews, It took well above 90 mins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 DSA - Binary Search Problem with some tricks and needed optimizations - Good Question&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In-depth discussion of work in my previous internships &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In-depth discussion of one project - He asked to write the code of one of the APIs of my project and asked to do some tweaks in the database calls inside it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discussion about my volunteering and leadership experiences. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why Amazon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 Behavioural questions checking Amazon Leadership Principles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same week, I received the selection call 🎉&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: All rounds were eliminatory rounds and were conducted in 2 days.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning&lt;/strong&gt; - The interviewer advised me to never stop working on "&lt;a href="http://girlcodeit.com/"&gt;Girl Code It&lt;/a&gt;"(it's an &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/girl-code-it/"&gt;organisation&lt;/a&gt; that I run). He said, everybody works for money, promotions, a better life etc. but only a few have selfless purposes, Don't let it go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#microsoft-selected"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  MICROSOFT - SELECTED
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Role&lt;/strong&gt;: Software Developer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Timeline&lt;/strong&gt;: Applied in January, Interviewed in February&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Applied through&lt;/strong&gt;: Microsoft Engage Hackathon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Process&lt;/strong&gt;:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hackathon: 5 Problem Statements were given. My project was shortlisted and I was called for the further interview process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online Test: 3 Coding Questions and MCQs. 2 coding questions were easy but the 3rd was one was a damn tough problem on graphs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1st Technical Round(45 mins):

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resume and Projects Grilling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hackathon Project Discussed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Questions around REST APIs, HTTP Verbs, request and response headers, SQL vs NOSQL - Usecases, ACID properties etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2nd Technical Round(30 mins): 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 Coding Questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topics: Linked List, Hashmaps, DP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Average difficulty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AA Round(As appropriate):

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The recruiter told me that interviewer could ask anything in this round - coding question, fundamentals, projects, HR questions etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Coding Question (From arrays, it was a new and tricky question and I don't remember it exactly) and asked Why I wanted to join Microsoft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of it went well overall. I couldn't tell the optimised approach at first but after some thinking I gave the expected solution soon. The interviewer even made a comment that he liked the way I approached the question from different directions and liked my confidence even after not hitting the right approach in the first go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a couple of days, I received the selection call 🎉&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: All rounds were eliminatory rounds and were conducted on different days.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning&lt;/strong&gt; -  By this time, so much had changed about the way I interview, I once ruined my Amazon and Google Interviews because of being nervous after telling the brute approach, I have written it before, and will again repeat - Don't think too much, Nervousness can slow down your brain :p&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#palantir-rejected"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  PALANTIR - REJECTED
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Role&lt;/strong&gt;: Software Developer &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Timeline&lt;/strong&gt;: Applied in December, Interviewed in February&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Location&lt;/strong&gt;: London&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Applied through&lt;/strong&gt;: Careers Site(without referral)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Process&lt;/strong&gt;:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online Coding Test: 3 Coding Questions. The questions were different and difficult than the usual ones, I solved 2 completely and 1 partially. Also, this was the only company where I got an interview call without hitting a 100% score in coding questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1st F2F Coding Round(60 mins): 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 Coding Questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Topics&lt;/strong&gt;: Strings, Arrays, Trees, Hashmaps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The questions were easy but running code for all 3 was expected, and the implementation of each of them were lengthy. I coded as fast as I could and completed and explained my solutions to the interviewer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another Coding Round:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A tricky Binary Tree Problem, later the interviewer asked the same question for generic tree. It went good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning Round: 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some rules of a new language were shared to me during the interview itself, and I was asked a few questions which I had to solve using that language syntax. It was very much like SQL. This round went good too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decomposition Round: 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was more like a system design round if I would label it. A scenario for an app was given and I had to discuss it's high-level design. I wasn't prepared for it, but still did my best and interviewer seemed neutral. I couldn't judge how he felt about my performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a couple of days, I received the rejection and feedback call 🎉.&lt;br&gt;
The recruiter told me that, the feedback from all rounds is positive except the Decomposition Round. They liked me but still wouldn't be able to proceed with my application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: The interview process and support was one of the best I experienced.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Prepare System Design :P&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Though, I wasn't selected, but I gave my best and had a great experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#twitter-selected"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  TWITTER - SELECTED
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role&lt;/strong&gt; - Software Engineer&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Timeline&lt;/strong&gt; - June, Last interview that I gave :p&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Twitter asks the candidates to sign an NDA before the interview process, So I won't be able to share any specifics. My friend has penned down the general process, you can refer it &lt;a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/my-twitter-interview-experience-ba621aa50b87"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#some-more-tips"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Some more Tips
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Test&lt;/strong&gt;: Try to solve all the questions. I have faced rejection even after solving all questions few times, leave alone the hopes of getting an interview without solving all questions completely.&lt;br&gt;
Giving live or even virtual contests on codeforces.com, codechef.com(short only), atcoder.com, binarysearch.io, leetcode.com will equip you with problem solving skills, quick implementation ability, effective debugging, edge-cases recognition and resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Within the actual Interview&lt;/strong&gt;: I have a lot to share on this topic, so I will write a separate article altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting calls from companies&lt;/strong&gt;: A good resume, an impressive LinkedIn profile, applying to as many companies as possible and and an added referral(I took all the referrals through LinkedIn only) is the only answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are not getting replies from companies, not getting shortlisted, not getting selected after interviews, Just remember - &lt;br&gt;
"जरूरी थोड़ी है, कि जो पत्थर तुम मारो, उससे आम टूटे ही टूटे, आखिर कुछ कोशिशें तैयारी के लिए भी होती हैं"&lt;br&gt;
English Translation - "It isn't necessary that every stone you throw will hit the target, after all, some efforts are also made for preparation.""&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
There is a possibility that there might be some deviations in the timeline that I have mentioned and the order/number of interviews might also differ for someone else. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good Luck for your interviews!&lt;br&gt;
Also, Please share the article with those who can be helped with it and I hope it gave you a general idea of how the SDE Interviews at various companies look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to know something else, Feel free to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cara Update Node js di Linux</title>
      <author>Roby Cigar</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 14:00:35 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/rabihcigar/cara-update-node-js-di-linux-26ii</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/rabihcigar/cara-update-node-js-di-linux-26ii</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jika kita memakai linux dan ingin menginstall nodejs lewat command &lt;code&gt;sudo apt install node&lt;/code&gt; kemungkinan besar nodejs yang kita install masih versi 10, untuk mengupdate node ke versi terbaru berikut ini langkah-langkahnya&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update Linux Package
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt update
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install nvm
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Setelah itu restart terminal kita.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cek Instalasi
Buka kembali terminal dan cek apakah kita berhasil menginstall nvm dengan command.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;nvm --version
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install Node 
Sebelum itu kita lihat versi node yang tersedia.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;nvm ls-remote
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lalu install menggunakan command berikut.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;nvm install [version.number]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;contoh &lt;code&gt;nvm install v14.17.3&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JP in da Kyiv, and crypto R&amp;D internship pre-announcement</title>
      <author>Cossack Labs</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 14:00:33 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/cossacklabs/jp-in-da-kyiv-and-crypto-r-d-internship-pre-announcement-3ad8</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/cossacklabs/jp-in-da-kyiv-and-crypto-r-d-internship-pre-announcement-3ad8</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the pandemic restrictions times, meeting offline is a luxury, especially given that you adore hardcore 😷↔️😷 discussions on cryptography, ZKP/ZkSNARKs, or post-quantum computing. We had one just recently and it inspired us for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week we hosted in Kyiv, Ukraine a legendary cryptographer, researcher, and &lt;a href="https://www.cossacklabs.com/"&gt;Cossack Labs&lt;/a&gt;’ business partner &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/veorq"&gt;Jean-Philippe (JP) Aumasson&lt;/a&gt;. He stands behind SipHash, BLAKE2/3 hash functions as their co-designer, and behind several modern books on cryptography as their author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this long-awaited visit we were ready to kill the fatted calf and party hard. 😊 And we had it all up to eleven during the special crypto drinks &amp;amp; talks event. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yay, that was awesome! A cosy venue in downtown Kyiv, relaxed summer mood, and exchange of experiences &amp;amp; great ideas with JP and the Ukrainian cryptography community people. We can talk about cryptography audits, root key ceremonies, &lt;a href="https://www.cossacklabs.com/blog/secure-search-over-encrypted-data-acra-se.html"&gt;searchable encryption&lt;/a&gt;, end-to-end encryption, and &lt;a href="https://github.com/veorq/oee"&gt;one-end encryption&lt;/a&gt; for ages! If you do too, join us next time without hesitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6xHSUXhn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/e8yr32ql1ko816qv93l3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6xHSUXhn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/e8yr32ql1ko816qv93l3.png" alt="Anastasiia Voitova (Cossack Labs) and Jean-Philippe (JP) Aumasson"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Anastasiia Voitova (Cossack Labs) and Jean-Philippe (JP) Aumasson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, Cossack Labs team had more of its guilty crypto pleasure with a 💪 special workshop on crypto attacks/defenses and PQC, designed by JP and Philipp Jovanovic (&lt;a href="https://www.ringzer0.training/crypto-attacks-defenses.html"&gt;check it out&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💡 And since we stand for the concept of giving knowledge back to the community and recently finished the first cycle of our &lt;a href="https://dev.to/cossacklabs/backstage-cryptographic-r-d-internship-at-cossack-labs-24dg"&gt;crypto R&amp;amp;D internship&lt;/a&gt;, it is more than possible that we have several spots for new interns🎓 in the autumn. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check for updates if you enjoy the same cryptographic wave.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xNbA9lp0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ual6y9lf8nszkj7445e7.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xNbA9lp0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ual6y9lf8nszkj7445e7.png" alt="Quantum Computers: how bad for Crypto? © JP Aumasson"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Quantum Computers: how bad for Crypto? © JP Aumasson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>You should probably learn TypeScript</title>
      <author>Ben Halpern</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 13:51:49 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yes, &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is trending right now...&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag__link"&gt;
  &lt;a href="/akashshyam" class="ltag__link__link"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ltag__link__pic"&gt;
      &lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kZYzhxPS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AK0yButL--/c_fill%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_150%2Cq_auto%2Cw_150/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/profile_image/499259/11ca155a-637a-49cc-ae2d-69df31f0e321.png" alt="akashshyam"&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;div class="ltag__link__content"&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;To Typescript Or To Not?&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;Akash Shyam ・ Jul 27 ・ 4 min read&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;div class="ltag__link__taglist"&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#typescript&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#javascript&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#discuss&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's certainly always valid to compare and contrast... Especially as a project decision maker. The pros and cons are very relevant, but as an individual developer, these tradeoffs should not affect your decisions on whether to explicitly take the time to learn this technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn TypeScript in order to be more employable because of the popularity of this approach to JavaScript, but also learn TypeScript because it is going to open you to new paradigms you might otherwise neglect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as bang-for-your-buck goes, it's probably one of the more valuable learning opportunities out there right now. It's trendy and popular, but it is hardly "hipster technology". You are going to get a lot out of learning this programming language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... But once you learn it, don't &lt;em&gt;demand&lt;/em&gt; that your company immediately adopt it. There are a lot of valid reasons to stay the course. Rewrites are expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ReactJS project for beginners</title>
      <author>Tousif</author>

      <description>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;ReactJS project&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aiming to master front-end frameworks? Start learning &lt;span&gt;ReactJS &lt;/span&gt;diligently and look forward to a great career in programming. The best way to move forward is to start building ReactJS projects for beginners and get hands-on with ReactJS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By working on smaller real-life projects, you can master theoretical concepts and get ready for the professional development challenges. Once you have successfully deployed your &lt;em&gt;ReactJS&lt;/em&gt; apps you can present those achievements to your future employers and get your dream job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building &lt;span&gt;ReactJS projects for beginners&lt;/span&gt; will not only allow you to strengthen up React skills but also will help you explore your creative sides as a developer. Also, it will make you familiar with &lt;span&gt;React developer tools&lt;/span&gt; and react ecosystem for each project as per the need for that project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;React project development is a self-directed process. You’ll have to learn on a trial and error basis. Unlike the basics of React via online learning materials, there’ll not be much to guide you on building React projects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;JavaScript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the key to learning JavaScript or any other programming language for that matter requires you to invest a lot of time and effort into developing a lot of projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us assume that you have a limited amount of time and you want to create JavaScript projects that you haven’t worked on before. And working on new ideas and projects is necessary because if you keep doing stuff that you already understand, you won’t be making much progress against your long-term programming ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very same time, you want to select tasks that are not too complicated. The key is to find a proposed project that’s just a little above your current ability level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your goal, then, should be to start small and set reasonable milestones for your learning journey. The last thing you want is to launch an ambitious project and end up feeling discouraged when you’re stuck with it. And believe us when we say this, it happens a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a web developer’s job to stay in touch with all the latest trends, as well as all the essential frameworks and libraries. It is also possible that you just got done with your JavaScript course and want to put your learning into practice. Either, we understand your needs and thus have created a compelling list of some of the best &lt;span&gt;JavaScript projects for beginners&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>C++ Project For Beginners</title>
      <author>Tousif</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 13:34:27 +0000</pubDate>

&lt;h3&gt;C++ Project For Beginners&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C++ was built as an extension to C and gave programmers a high control over memory and system resources. If you know any other programming language, C++ will be easy to learn. Even otherwise, C++ is a friendly language, and you can learn it through some hands-on projects and practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article lists 10 C++ projects of different levels, which will help you appreciate the language more. You can also try many other similar projects. For example, one of our projects is Bookshop inventory management. You can try a library management system as well on the same lines. Again, similar to the railway ticket reservation system, you can try out the Bus ticket reservation system.&lt;/p&gt;
