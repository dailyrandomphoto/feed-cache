      <title>What is Authorization (with examples)</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/propelauth/what-is-authorization-with-examples-33cp</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The word "auth" is complicated because there a wide range of topics that fall in the bucket of "auth." In this series, we'll take a practical approach to understanding many of these topics with examples to learn from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously, we wrote about &lt;a href="https://blog.propelauth.com/understanding-user-authentication-from-scratch/"&gt;user authentication&lt;/a&gt;. Now, let's look at a related topic, authorization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-authorization"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Authorization?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authorization is the process of determining if someone has access to something. This is different from authentication, which is about determining who someone is in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, imagine we are building a simplified Twitter. Users can sign up, post tweets, and delete tweets. When we receive a request to delete a tweet, we need to do two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine who made the request&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine if they are allowed to delete the tweet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 1 is authentication - we are determining &lt;strong&gt;who&lt;/strong&gt; the user is. Step 2 is authorization - we are determining if that user &lt;strong&gt;is allowed&lt;/strong&gt; to delete the tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, step 2 could be as simple as only the user that made the tweet is allowed to delete it:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;canDeleteTweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Authentication&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;userId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getUserThatMadeTheRequest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Authorization &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;userId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;userId&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Step 2 could also include other rules, like maybe we hire a moderation team and allow them to delete tweets as well:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;canDeleteTweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Authentication&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;userId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getUserThatMadeTheRequest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Authorization &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;userId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;userId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;isUserAModerator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;userId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#implementing-authorization"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Implementing Authorization
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of different approaches to implementing authorization. One example that you might have come across before is role-based access control (RBAC). Role-based access control is a fancy way of saying "assign each user to a role (or group) and each role has a defined set of actions they can take".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We actually already looked at an example of RBAC above. In our simplified Twitter example, we had two roles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Moderators&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Users&lt;/strong&gt; (we implicitly defined this as everyone who isn't a moderator)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users can create tweets and delete their own tweets. Moderators can delete anyone's tweets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can extend this in a lot of ways. For example, maybe your roles are hierarchical. Each role has its own set of permissions and also gets all the permissions from any role beneath it in the hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RBAC is generally seen as a coarser form of authorization, since each user must belong to a role and every user within that role gets the same permissions. Another example approach is attribute-based access control (ABAC), where you look at attributes (e.g. what team the user is on, is this production or staging, etc.) to determine if a user can perform some action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#authorization-for-b2b-businesses"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Authorization for B2B Businesses
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's look at another example - building a B2B / SaaS business. In this case, let's say we're making an MVP of &lt;a href="https://slack.com/"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a B2B business, users will use your product along with their coworkers. To accommodate that, each user can be a member of an organization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first permission that we need is the ability to create an organization and every user should be allowed to do it. Once an organization is created, we have three hierarchical roles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Owner&lt;/strong&gt; - Able to delete the organization, manage billing, and invite new owners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Admin&lt;/strong&gt; - Able to create new channels, manage organization settings, and invite new admins/members&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Member&lt;/strong&gt; - Able to send messages in any channel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these roles apply only within the context of an organization. I can be an &lt;strong&gt;Owner&lt;/strong&gt; of organization A and a &lt;strong&gt;Member&lt;/strong&gt; of organization B. Those roles dictate my permissions within the organization - not globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since these roles are hierarchical, Admins have all the permissions that Members have, and Owners have all the permissions that Admins have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Owner, Admin, and Member hierarchy is straightforward, and works for a lot of B2B businesses but it can be tricky to manage in practice. If you'd prefer to let someone else handle it, &lt;a href="https://www.propelauth.com"&gt;PropelAuth&lt;/a&gt; provides this structure by default - including UIs for inviting users, UIs for managing roles, and libraries for adding authorization to your backend.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tips for writing performant code</title>
      <author>Demetre</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/demetrejou/tips-for-writing-performant-code-2c4</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/demetrejou/tips-for-writing-performant-code-2c4</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-performant-code-is-all-about-memory"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why performant code is all about memory
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasing the performance of a given piece of code is not as simple as throwing more ram, more GHz, or more cores by cranking the cloud provider's knob to 11. Decreasing the runtime of a serial program or improving the scaling per core of a parallel program requires not only a deeper understanding of the underlying hardware, but also writing code with that hardware in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is true that the number of transistors has doubled each year, the per-core frequency has been tapering off since 2010. CPUs single-core performance has started to follow the same tampering off trend. In contrast, the number of logical cores per processor has doubled every few years. In recent history, AMD's Ryzen line has pushed 4 cores / 8 threads from being the top of the line to 32 cores / 32 threads now being top of the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the number of transistors and logical cores continues to climb every year, unfortunately, the speed of memory accesses has not. The gap between the speed the CPU can process numbers and the speed it can access memory from cache or main memory has grown every year. For any modern machine, the time spent pulling data from memory vastly overshadows that of actually doing useful computations. This is why, when trying to improve the run time performance of code, it is not a technique to decrease the number of computations that materialize the largest improvement. It instead requires changes to how data is used and accessed. It is techniques to best utilizing the cache that specifically has the biggest effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An easy to understand generalization of modern memory is that there are 2 levels. The first, being a small but very fast cache and the other, a slow but larger main memory (or DRAM). When something is initially loaded from DRAM to be used by the CPU, it is also placed into the cache, evicting something else to take its place. This simple model is nice, but in reality, there are multiple cache layers and multiple ways to pick what to evict. Things like hardware prefetching and cache lines also come into play. Those topics are all much outside the scope of this article, but interesting to read about nonetheless. This nice and simple model is what we're going to use. For reference, reading from cache is an order of magnitude faster than reading from main memory. It takes single-digit nano-seconds (ns) to read from cache vs. ~100ns to read from main memory, although this still depends entirely on specific hardware.  While a programmer can't directly choose what goes into cache and what gets evicted, they can still get a very good idea. Being always cognizant of what's likely to be in cache and avoiding these slow memory accesses is the key to achieving a sizable speed up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entire article will be written with C in mind but the main ideas are transferable to most anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#foreword"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Foreword
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before trying to engineer code to run faster, the underlying algorithm should always be looked at first. There is almost no reason to try to optimize an O(n^2) algorithm when an O(n) one exists. While there are cases, especially when dealing with small amounts of data, that n^2 might be faster due to implementation details, this article is targeting algorithms running on data much larger than that. Nothing in this article will help make selection sort faster than merge sort for significantly large arrays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ways-to-increase-cache-hits"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Ways to increase cache hits
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole name of the game to improve serial performance is increasing cache hits. Or otherwise, the goal is to reduce how often something is loaded from main memory. Either way, the end goal is to reduce the amount of time (cycles) it takes to load something into the CPU. The two major ways to do this is with the techniques of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Temporal locality and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spatial locality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before moving on, we should add a small but important twist to the simple memory model. When something is loaded from slow memory into cache, the level of granularity is not a single byte or word but an entire cache line. These cache lines are in the range of 64 or 128 bytes. When a single int is requested by the program and that int is in slow memory, the entire cache line the int is in is also brought into cache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#temporal-locality"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Temporal locality
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reuse data that is already in cache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that once a value is loaded in for the first time, it should be used as much as possible. It should be mentioned that it’s never possible to 100% avoid slow memory accesses since at some point something has to be loaded in for the first time, even when considering cache lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an example, compare the following code snippets:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;for person in persons:

    person.first_name.lower()

// lots of unrelated memory loads here

for person in persons:

    person.last_name.lower()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;vs&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;for person in persons:

    person.first_name.lower()
    person.last_name.lower()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While this is a quite simplified example, the idea is visible. For a large &lt;code&gt;persons&lt;/code&gt; array, each     &lt;code&gt;person&lt;/code&gt; will have to be loaded twice in the first example, but only once in the second. While a good compiler can see this and might fuse the loops together, it can't always rely on compiler optimizations to reordering large blocks of code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#spatial-locality"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Spatial locality
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operate on data that are stored close to each other in memory and potentially would have been brought into cache together.&lt;br&gt;
Because data is brought into cache at the cache line level, adjacent data is also brought in cache. When iterating through a list, it is much better to access linearly instead of random accesses because of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While most loops are linear by default, one must not forget about the instructions of the code itself. Those still need to be brought into cache and read in order to be executed. While this effect is small, having many function calls requires many jumps in instruction memory, creating more slow memory accesses. This is why some compilers will automatically inline functions, saving this extra function call overhead and potential slow memory access. Modern CPUs also do branch prediction which somewhat mitigates the performance hit of function calls or logical branching statements. Again though, one can't always rely on compiler optimizations when trying to squeeze out the little bit of performance that is possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#parallel-processing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Parallel Processing
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"But why can't you just add more cores to the code to make it run faster? Why bother spending time to make serial code faster?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without fast serial code, the parallel code won't be good. All the same principles to making serial code fast apply to parallel code as well. Without these good fundamentals already satisfied, the parallel code will never be as fast as it could be. There are extra things to keep in mind when dealing with parallel code. Explaining how to decompose data, decompose tasks, schedule threads, and everything else required to make incredibly fast parallel code, would fill up an entire book. Instead, this article will mention just some basic things to keep in mind before trying to turn serial code into parallel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#amdahls-law"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Amdahl's Law
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amdahl's law gives the formula for the theoretically speed up in run time of a task or program. Not all parts of a program can be parallelized. So, even with infinite cores and perfect parallelized code, there is still a minimum amount of run time because of the serial parts of the program. This is why focusing on writing fast serial code is important to do as a first step. Even if 90% of the program can be parallelized, with infinite cores the program can still only achieve a 10x speedup. If 75% of the program can be parallelized, the program can achieve at best a 4x speedup. Well-written serial code can easily achieve a 4x speedup by itself and is easier to write, easier to debug, and easier to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with a slow serial implementation and trying to parallelize it will never give as good of results as writing very good serial code from the start and parallelizing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#embarrassing-parallel"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Embarrassing parallel
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is almost opposite to the idea of Amdahl's law. Amdahl's law says that even in the best case one can only achieve a modest speedup multiplier. Embarrassing parallel problems are ones in which little to no effort is required to effectively parallelize a problem. Sometimes these problems are also called perfectly parallel, or pleasingly parallel. The opposite of these would be inherently serial problems that can't be meaningfully parallelized at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's worth learning which types of problems are embarrassing parallel, because they're the low-hanging fruit when trying to decrease run time. These problems are normally characterized by having no interdependencies between tasks. The data can be easily split, no thread-to-thread communication is required. Things like password cracking, 3D video rendering, and numerical integration are all examples of this set of problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#parallelizing-isnt-free"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Parallelizing isn't free
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a given problem, where a large part of it can be parallelized and that part can be parallelized well, there is still an added runtime cost of parallelizing it. Only in outlier circumstances will no synchronization between threads be required. In C/C++, locking and unlocking mutexes still has a cost. While there are fewer (operating) system calls when the mutex isn't contested by other threads there is still additional overhead. There are other ways to synchronize threads, semaphores, signals, and barriers. These additional synchronization mechanics are often required to ensure program correctness and avoid race conditions. They also add additional developer overhead which is an extra thing to consider. There is no free lunch by parallelizing part of the algorithm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#false-sharing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  False Sharing
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When 2 threads load the same cache line into their respective caches and the cache line values are only read and not modified, there is no issue. However, when one thread writes to any part of that cache line, the entire cache line is now marked as invalid and written back to main memory. Whenever another thread tries to read that now invalid cache line, it will have to re-read it from slow memory even if it's trying to access a different part of the cache line. This issue is called false sharing and causes almost an artificial increase in run time. This problem can be commonly seen when an array is shared between threads. If each thread writes to a different index of the array, there will be no synchronization required, but the data access times will be very bad because that entire cache line will have to be reloaded from slow memory every time. This issue can be worked around by creating a new local variable for each thread instead of sharing the array, or padding the array with dummy values so that each thread is reading values at least one cache line away from each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#measure-scaling"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Measure scaling
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, the run time decreases linearly with the number of threads or cores added. Real world use cases rarely reflect this ideal speed up. When measuring the speedup achieved by adding additional cores, there are two ways to measure it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong Scaling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is when the amount of data being worked on stays the same and the amount of cores increases,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weak scaling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is when the amount of data increases with the number of cores being added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These scaling amounts are by no means guaranteed to be the same, and it's worth investigating both of these scaling values when comparing a parallel version of a program to a serial version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#things-not-mentioned"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Things not mentioned
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these topics are interesting and worth investigating in their own right, they're simply too complex for this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other kinds of compiler optimizations include:&lt;br&gt;
Optimizing registers,&lt;br&gt;
Different levels of gcc optimization e.g -O1, -O2, -O3,&lt;br&gt;
Loop unrolling,&lt;br&gt;
Different multi-processor models such as distributed systems and GPUs,&lt;br&gt;
Calculating efficiency, machine balance, and machine peak,&lt;br&gt;
Branch prediction on modern CPUs, and&lt;br&gt;
Hardware prefetching (or why iterating through a loop doesn't normally have cache misses).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;😶 &lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer : Read that before use it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For this moment, this GitHub Actions &lt;strong&gt;don't work properly like I would like&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;When GitHub add the possibility to add and/or edit comments in Discussions&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;I will update the project&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
I started this Action because I thinked that it is a good idea to have a moderate tool in Discussions part with the toxicity of comments So I did it thinking it would be feasible, but when I got to the end of the code part, I couldn't figure out how to create/edit comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;😵 &lt;strong&gt;But why do I still participate in the Hackathon, knowing that my action is not entirely finished?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
The idea of using the Perspective API came to me quite late. In 4-5 days I had to learn how to create my own GA (GitHub Actions) and how to execute JavaScript. How to use correctly the TOKEN of GitHub. I still have some small issues to fix on the source code, but I'm working on it, and like any project, there will be updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when I was almost at the end, I looked at the GitHub documentation to find out how to create a comment in the Discussions with Action section. Unfortunately, it's not possible, and I'm disgusted. Nevertheless, I leave the source code visible for everybody, because when GitHub will have added this option, the code will be updated and possible to use in your repositories. &lt;br&gt;
If you want to know more about how it works, I redirect you to &lt;a href="https://github.com/thomasbnt/actions-NoToxicDiscussions#how-its-work"&gt;How it's work&lt;/a&gt; part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the moment &lt;strong&gt;it scans&lt;/strong&gt; well and &lt;strong&gt;emits a percentage based on 1&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;the TOXICITY of the content&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perspective is a free API that helps you host better conversations online. The API uses machine learning models to score the perceived impact a comment might have on a conversation. You can use this score to give feedback to commenters, help moderators more easily review comments, allow readers to more easily find interesting or productive comments, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Software Engineering 💻What I've learned in one year!</title>
      <author>Gabriel Pedroza</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 19:23:02 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/gabrielpedroza/software-engineering-what-ive-learned-in-one-year-2aif</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/gabrielpedroza/software-engineering-what-ive-learned-in-one-year-2aif</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I decided to give this (making my first blog) a try when I realized how close I was to reaching my first year of being a Frontend Engineer. This will also improve my Markdown skills which will also improve my README.md in my repositories. If you see any errors, please let me know because I always want to reach perfection... and because of my slight OCD in anything related to software😅&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#table-of-contents"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Table of Contents
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#intro"&gt;My background&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tldrspecifics"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a&gt;TLDR/Specifics&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of becoming a Frontend Engineer, I wrote down my progress:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7th grade (2014) - Used blocks of written code from made scratch.mit.edu to create basic games and animations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11th grade (2018) - Wrote my first HTML code in Advanced Placement Computer Science and had no interest or remembered anything whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;December 18th 2020 - Switched my major from Accounting to Computer Science because I wanted to be involved with technology and saw incredible and interactive websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Late December 2020 - Wrote my first line of code (Python). I chose Backend first because after researching, I’ve read that you get more income and it’s more logic-based. (Chose for the wrong reasons).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mid-way January 2021 - Realized after some on and off time of Backend, it wasn’t suited for me at the time and only chose it for the money so I decided to try front end and almost instantly feel in love (Inspired by &lt;a href="https://bruno-simon.com/"&gt;Bruno Simon’s Portfolio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;February 2021 - Watched an 11 and half hour video (willingly😅) on the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU6anWqZJcc&amp;amp;t=6365s"&gt;basics of HTML and CSS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March 4th 2021 - Bought my first &lt;a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend"&gt;Frontend course&lt;/a&gt; (Html5, Css3, Js(es5+), and React (class and functional components)) on &lt;a href="//www.scrimba.com"&gt;Scrimba&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Midway March 2021 - Wrote my first line of JavaScript code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;End of April 2021 - Registered in another course &lt;a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/javascript"&gt;The JavaScript Bootcamp&lt;/a&gt; to enhance my JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May 27th 2021 - Made a &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabrielpedroza/"&gt;LinkedIn account&lt;/a&gt; to network and meet new people that have similar interests as me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 13th 2021 - Finished JavaScript bootcamp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July 12th 2021 - Bought a &lt;a href="https://threejs-journey.com/"&gt;Three.js course&lt;/a&gt; with GLSL and Blender included by Bruno Simon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July 15th 2021 - Wrote my first line of React code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mid September - Learned about Git (commands) and currently using it to push code, pull code, and make open source contributions from and to local repositories on my Github account after learning how to use GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;September 25th 2021 - Wrote my first line of custom shaders in GLSL (Shading Language).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;October 23 2021 - Finished Three.js course while balancing Scrimba’s courses and school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;October 24 2021 - Using &lt;a href="https://docs.pmnd.rs/home"&gt;React Three Fiber and its helpers&lt;/a&gt; to start creating 3D projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;October 28 2021 - Bought &lt;a href="https://www.algoexpert.io/product"&gt;AlgoExpert&lt;/a&gt; to learn DSA and also deepen my knowledge using JavaScript while preparing for coding interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;October 30 2021 - Learned how to calculate time and space complexity using Big O notation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;November 1 2021 - Used SCSS modules for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;November 21 2021 - Used &lt;a href="https://mui.com/"&gt;Material UI&lt;/a&gt; for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;December 7 2021 - Learned Yarn. Will use in future projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-background"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a&gt;My Background&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short, I was majoring in Accounting as a freshman in college and I was not enjoying it at all. I later found out about Computer Science (specifically Full-Stack (Frontend and Backend)) and it caught my attention. I decided to switch when my semester finished at December 18, 2019. I have minimal exposure to coding. Checkout the beginning of &lt;a href="#tldr"&gt;TLDR/Specifics&lt;/a&gt; to understand specifically what I knew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#when-i-decided-to-become-a-front-end-developer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a&gt;When I Decided to Become a Front End Developer&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mid-way through January, I decided to switch from Backend to Frontend. I was inspired by &lt;a href="https://bruno-simon.com/"&gt;Bruno Simon's portfolio&lt;/a&gt; and all the other projects on the official page of &lt;a href="https://threejs.org/"&gt;Three.js&lt;/a&gt;. It changed my perspective on websites completely and with a combination of being inspired and experiencing a shit-ton of "bad" websites over the years, I decided to become a Frontend Engineer without looking at its salary, the hard work it would take to feel "ready", and everything else that comes with being a developer that I've probably haven't experienced yet. It was a turning point in my life and I didn't even know how much it would consume me. I can definitely say after a year of programming, I am so happy I chose it because of the right reasons. I got lucky that it pays well and it is a great career path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-advice-to-future-programmers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a&gt;My Advice to Future Programmers&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JUST START ALREADY! When I started programming, I never saw it as boring or as a job in any way; Frontend for me was just so exciting because of what you can create and be able to give that experience to others that come across your website/projects. Personally, for the first 6-8 months, I learned about code or watch anything that was code-related for a good 8-10 hours every single day (you do NOT need to do this🤦🏻‍♂️). This definitely caused a huge burnout for me. My social life and health were struggling immensely and I wasn't retaining any of the information anymore. I decided to take a break and slowly and focus on my social and health more. It was the best decision for me in every way possible and I would recommend anyone who starts to become a programmer to understand that there is a lot of information to learn and your comfort zone will be eviscerated. You will feel that overwhelming sensation of not being good enough but after that stage of feeling "useless", your mental strength will be calloced from the adversity and your success it will overshadow that stage. I promise😊&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-future-goals-as-a-frontend-engineer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a&gt;My Future Goals as a Frontend Engineer&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many goals that I want to accomplish as a Frontend Engineer. The main one is to land a job and become a paid full-time engineer. Currently, I am making projects to include on my curriculum vitae, learning DSA, and filling any holes I have currently since I am a self-taught engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Believe you can and you’re halfway there.” —Theodore Roosevelt&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is our attitude at the beginning of a difficult task which, more than anything else, will affect its successful outcome.” —William James&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think I can. I think I can. I think I can. I know I can.” —Watty Piper, The Little Engine That Could&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Life isn’t finding shelter in the storm. It’s about learning to dance in the rain.” ―Sherrilyn Kenyon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Whether you think you can or think you can’t you’re right.” —Henry Ford&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish everyone the best of luck on your journey! &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Inspiration
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being an LFX Mentee at Kyverno this quarter, I was looking after and enchancing their Security Processes and their CI mechanisms. That is when I was exposed to the world of DevSecOps. I remember copying down the same actions multiple times. Fast forward to a month and here I am in this Github Action x DEV Hackathon 2021 where I am solving this problem so that nobody faces this again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-workflow"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My Workflow
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I introduce y'all to SecYourIT (read: sec-your-it-e), a 5-in-one DevSecOps reusable GitHub workflow that takes care of your project's security in the CI itself thanks to Github Actions. You can customise it based on the language of your project as it supports more than 20 languages.&lt;br&gt;
It handles the following components of your project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sensitive Token Exposure [Check for Tokens or Keys being pushed]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commit Authenticity Verification [Verify Commits]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dependency Scanning [Scan for vulnerabilities in Dependencies]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SCA [Software Composition Analysis],&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SAST [Static Application Security Testing]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;span class="pl-ent"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;:
            &lt;span class="pl-ent"&gt;language&lt;/span&gt;:
        &lt;span class="pl-ent"&gt;secrets&lt;/span&gt;:
            &lt;span class="pl-ent"&gt;SNYK_API_TOKEN&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;${{secrets.SNYK_API_TOKEN}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;☁️☁️☁️&lt;br&gt;
Hi programmers + coders alike ! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, we will be walking through two (2) LeetCode challenges: &lt;strong&gt;Sqrt(x)&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Valid Perfect Square&lt;/strong&gt;. I decided to pair these challenges together in a walkthrough because they relate to each other AND show the various ways to approach a solution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the links to the challenges: &lt;a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/"&gt;Sqrt(x)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-perfect-square/"&gt;Valid Perfect Square&lt;/a&gt;. Go ahead and pull the first challenge up on your end + let's get started :)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sqrtx"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's take a look at the instructions provided by LeetCode:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Given a non-negative integer 'x', compute and return the square root of 'x'.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated, and only the integer part of the result is returned.

Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in exponent function or operator, such as pow(x, 0.5) or x ** 0.5.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From the instructions, we can resolve a few things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Input is a positive integer. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output is a positive integer; decimal points must be truncated (taken off). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We cannot use any exponent operator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The instructions are pretty straight-forward. However, the truncated decimal might be something new for you. (It was for me!) Growing up, in math class we always &lt;em&gt;rounded&lt;/em&gt; decimals to the nearest whole number. For this assignment, we are going to &lt;em&gt;truncate&lt;/em&gt; the decimal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we look to the example LeetCode provides, we can see exactly what this looks like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Example 2
  Input: x = 8
  Output: 2
  Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The square root of 8 is not rounded to the nearest whole number; instead, the decimals are just chopped off. To me, this is strange, but hey, I do not make the instructions here. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#approach-solution"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Approach + Solution
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this is a math-based question, we can consider a wide slew of built in Math methods provided in JavaScript. These built-in Math methods are both life and time savers. Here is a &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to a good chunk of Math methods. &lt;strong&gt;Bookmark or save this link!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we return to our goals of this challenge, we need to achieve two (2) things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return the square root any positive integer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return the output as a positive integer (no floats!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve the first goal, JavaScript provides 'Math.sqrt(x)'. According to the link above, this method 'returns the positive square root of the given input'. Wow! Exactly what we need. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let's build this out:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Starting by building the foundation of a  function that takes in a parameter of 'x'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mySqrt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Then, declare and assign a variable to the result of Math.sqrt(x) method. &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;squareRoot&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sqrt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;squareRoot&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At this point, if we were to pass in an integer of '100', we would receive an output of '10'. Nice! That works! However, if we were to pass in an integer of '200', we would receive an output of '14.142135....' Well, yea that is correct, but remember the instructions: we need to return a truncated decimal. So, we need to return solely '14'. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we continue to look at that trusty goldmine of built-in Math methods, we may come across 'Math.trunc(x)'. This method 'returns the integer portion of the given input, removing any fractional digits.' Actually perfect! Let's add this functionality to our code:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Starting by building the foundation of a  function that takes in a parameter of 'x'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mySqrt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Then, declare and assign a variable to the result of Math.sqrt(x) method. &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Then, we wrap Math.trunc() around Math.sqrt(x).&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;squareRoot&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;trunc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sqrt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;squareRoot&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Try this out in your console with an input of x = 250. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you receive an output of '15'? If you did, good! Our code works.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#valid-perfect-square"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Valid Perfect Square
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#instructions-examples"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Instructions + Examples
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onto our next challenge, let's look at the instructions:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Given a positive integer 'num', write a function which returns 'True' if 'num' is a perfect square. Otherwise returns 'False'.

*Follow up: Do not use any built-in library function such as sqrt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From these instructions, we can resolve a few things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Input is a positive integer. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output is a boolean: true or false.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We CANNOT use any built-in JavaScript methods, like we did in the previous challenge. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's look at the examples provided:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Example 1:

Input: num = 16
Output: true


Example 2:

Input: num = 14
Output: false
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alright -- simple enough. However, the instructions &lt;em&gt;specifically&lt;/em&gt; stated to NOT use any built-in Math methods. This is our time to shine and revert back to seventh grade algebra! Let's get it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#approach-solution"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Approach + Solution
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is a &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; square? It is an integer, when taken the square root of, returns a positive integer. We know a few: 4, 9, 16, 25, 100...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how do we formulate a test (ahem, our code) to figure this out? We can start by creating a formula that outputs the square root of any given positive integer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the math formula equivalent of the square root operator? It's the exponent of one-half. Try it out on a calculator. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the exponent operator (**), here is what we can code:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;isPerfectSquare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;squareRoot&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;squareRoot&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If we pass the number 100 into the function, we should be returned the integer 10. Ok - but what if we pass in 12? We receive 3.464101.... Yes - that is the square root of 12, but remember we want to receive an output of either true or false based on num's validity as a perfect square. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we compare our two outputs: 10 and 3.464101, one is an integer and the other is a float (or decimal). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can use the remainder operator (%). If our squareRoot produces a remainder when divided by 1, then we know it is NOT a perfect square. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's code this out:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;isPerfectSquare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;squareRoot&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;squareRoot&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using our ol' faithful "if" statement, we can decipher that if our squareRoot variable does NOT produce a remainder, 'num' must be a perfect square. While if it does produce a remainder, 'num' is NOT a perfect square. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#summary-recap"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Summary + Recap
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within these two (2) examples, we can see the multiple approaches to solve a Math-related JavaScript question. Given specific instructions that inhibit our use of either built-in Math methods or arithmetic operators, we can resolve to do the opposite. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and try to solve each question again, except switch the rules this time. A solution is always available -- we may just have to dig a little first. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REMEMBER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your code readable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code in a way that makes sense to you. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Approach code a few different ways to come to a solution. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask questions. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep coding!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Project 7: Array Cardio Day 2</title>
      <author>prachigarg19</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 18:44:40 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/prachigarg19/project-7-array-cardio-day-2-25ln</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/prachigarg19/project-7-array-cardio-day-2-25ln</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my "Build 30 Js Projects in 30 Days" Series .This is day 7 and project 7. If you haven't read the other articles in this series please check them out first. I'll list them at the end of this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in my previous article. This is the Day 7 challenge of &lt;a href="https://javascript30.com/"&gt;Wes Bos Javascript30 course&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This challenge was more theoretical rather than implementation. It explained various array prototype methods that I found super helpful and so I'll be explaining each method taught in this challenge and I strongly recommend you to not skip this challenge.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://dev.to/prachigarg19/project-4-array-cardio-day-1-3b1k"&gt;Checkout&lt;/a&gt; the first part if you haven't yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always before starting download the starter files from &lt;a href="https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I've made a separate article on how to download starter files, you can check it out &lt;a href="https://dev.to/prachigarg19/build-30-javascript-projects-in-30-daysday-0-2m8j"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll be linking the documentations I referred for each function to further clear up the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before proceeding you should be familiar with arrow functions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.some():&lt;/strong&gt; It returns true if at least one element of our array satisfies the test condition of the function passed as a parameter.&lt;br&gt;
e.g. we want to check if any element is divisible by 3.There are 2 ways to do this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;let arr=[3,4,5,1,8];
let isDivisible=false;
for(item of arr){
    if(item%3==0)
    isDivisible=true;
}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now this can be done in a single line using some() method.&lt;br&gt;
It takes a function as a parameter(which will contain our condition), and the parameter function further takes the current element being checked, index(optional) and array on which some is used(optional) as parameters.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;let arr=[3,4,5,1,8];
let isDivisible=arr.some(item=&amp;gt;item%3==0)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here item is the current element being checked for its divisbiliy with 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See how code has been reduced to single line.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is the documentation I read along with the video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.every():&lt;/strong&gt; It is like some(),the difference is that it returns true ONLY IF ALL elements satisfies the condition.&lt;br&gt;
Let's take the same example as above.&lt;br&gt;
Long way-&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;let arr=[3,4,5,1,8];
let isDivisible=false;
let count=0;
for(item of arr){
    if(item%3==0)
    count++;
}
isDivisible=(count==5?true:false);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now this whole can be reduced to one line using every().&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;let arr=[3,4,5,1,8];
let isDivisible=arr.every(item=&amp;gt;item%3==0);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.find():&lt;/strong&gt; It is like &lt;a href="https://dev.to/prachigarg19/project-4-array-cardio-day-1-3b1k"&gt;filter&lt;/a&gt;,the difference is that instead or returning all the elements returning true for the condition,it returns the first element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking similar example-&lt;br&gt;
Long way-&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;let arr=[3,4,5,1,8];
let element;

for(item of arr){
    if(item%3==0)
    {
      element=item;
       break;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;using find() method-&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;let arr=[3,4,5,1,8];
let element=arr.find(item=&amp;gt;item%3==0)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Parameters are similar to all methods mentioned above.&lt;br&gt;
Here is the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.findIndex():&lt;/strong&gt; It returns the first index of the elements satisfying the condition. If no such element exists,-1 is returned.&lt;br&gt;
Let's return the index for the element in above example-&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;let arr=[3,4,5,1,8];
let index;

for(i=0;i&amp;lt;arr.length;i++){
    if(arr[i]%3==0)
    {
      index=i;
       break;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;using findIndex() function -&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;let arr=[3,4,5,1,8];
let index=arr.findIndex(item=&amp;gt;item%3==0)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Parameters are same as above functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For further understanding, refer &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/findIndex"&gt;Documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#things-i-learnt"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;Things I learnt:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More Array.prototype methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#previous-article-from-this-series"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;u&gt;Previous article from this series:&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/prachigarg19/project-6ajax-type-ahead-40b3"&gt;Day 6 Project 6&lt;/a&gt;.In this project I built a search filter which is very common feature in website nowadays. Do check it out if you haven't already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it for today's project.&lt;br&gt;
These functions as you saw are super handful and will surely help in reducing the line of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next project will be HTML5 Canvas .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any doubts or suggestions please do let me know in the comment section. I'll be more than happy to interact with you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Top 7 Featured DEV Posts from the Past Week</title>
      <author>Gracie Gregory (she/her)</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 18:14:02 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/devteam/top-7-featured-dev-posts-from-the-past-week-4c7j</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/devteam/top-7-featured-dev-posts-from-the-past-week-4c7j</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every Tuesday we round up the previous week's top posts based on traffic, engagement, and a hint of editorial curation.

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever needed to build and ship an API in very little time? Read this article to learn how to use Strapi to get the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;APIs are so useful and ubiquitous in any application, and as a developer, you may be fazed by building an API in very little time. In this article, I will show you how to build a Node.js API so fast (perhaps, in 10 minutes) using the help of Strapi’s intuitive interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-youll-learn"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What You’ll Learn
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to build an API quickly with Strapi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to build a Node backend without writing Node code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to manage relational fields with Strapi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to add GraphQL endpoints to fetch and mutate your API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#this-article-is-written-for"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  This Article Is Written For
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developers that need to build backend APIs quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developers that want to build a backend, but only want to focus on the frontend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developers that want to build a Node backend API, but don’t have the Node expertise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-you-will-build"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What You Will Build
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, you will start from scratch (i.e., from an empty directory), then you will go through all the steps needed to build an API using Strapi. The API that you will build will allow clients to make requests to manipulate content. The content, in this case, will represent blog posts (as in, for a blogging website - if you’d like to build out the frontend, moving forward.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prerequisites"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Prerequisites
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you’ll need for this tutorial:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowledge of API; it might make sense to learn about it first. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Node &amp;amp; NPM - You’ll need to have Node and NPM installed on your local machine. To confirm they’re installed, run the following commands in your terminal:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;node -v &amp;amp;&amp;amp; npm --v
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Node Package Manager comes installed with Node. If you don’t have them installed, you can follow the instructions on the official &lt;a href="https://nodejs.org/"&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt; website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tutorial was completed using Node v14.18.1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yarn - Yarn is a package manager that would help us manage our application dependencies in a way that is several times faster and more reliable than NPM. You can install yarn using:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install --global yarn
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what we’ll cover today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#intro-to-strapi"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Intro to Strapi
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strapi is an open-source headless CMS (Content Management System) based on Node.js that gives developers the ability to easily build self-hosted, customizable, and performant content APIs (RESTful and GraphQL). With Strapi, weeks of API development can be saved, because it’s no-code, and building a robust API could be done in less than 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn’t that awesome? I thought so too. Let’s dive right into how that can be made possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setting-up-the-strapi-project"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setting up the Strapi project
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are various ways to &lt;a href="https://strapi.io/documentation/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/installation.html"&gt;install&lt;/a&gt; a new Strapi project. However, the Strapi CLI is the best way to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For starters, open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you’d like to create this project. Run the following command in your terminal to scaffold a new Strapi project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn create strapi-app my-project --quickstart
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;code&gt;--quickstart&lt;/code&gt; flag at the end of the command provides you with the &lt;a href="https://www.sqlite.org/"&gt;SQLite&lt;/a&gt; database by default, and directly creates the project in quickstart mode. If you’d like to switch databases, &lt;a href="https://strapi.gitee.io/documentation/3.0.0-beta.x/guides/databases.html"&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When project creation is completed, the app should automatically start at &lt;a href="http://localhost:1337"&gt;localhost:1337&lt;/a&gt; on your browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iNEi5yw1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_EA40404FBBCC4B6AC68C86E59D06B777193FAD00C474FA40A98AAE13F8E620D5_1638058550273_image.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iNEi5yw1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_EA40404FBBCC4B6AC68C86E59D06B777193FAD00C474FA40A98AAE13F8E620D5_1638058550273_image.png" alt="" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your app didn’t automatically start, run the following command in the project folder:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn develop
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open up the app folder with your IDE, and the project structure should look like mine below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vwP8pUe4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_EA40404FBBCC4B6AC68C86E59D06B777193FAD00C474FA40A98AAE13F8E620D5_1638116197881_image.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vwP8pUe4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_EA40404FBBCC4B6AC68C86E59D06B777193FAD00C474FA40A98AAE13F8E620D5_1638116197881_image.png" alt="" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#building-the-strapi-backend"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Building the Strapi backend
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the project folder now created, the first step to building a Strapi backend is to register an admin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can register an admin by filling the form that was provided on startup, as I have done below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bkri-f0p--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_EA40404FBBCC4B6AC68C86E59D06B777193FAD00C474FA40A98AAE13F8E620D5_1638058810499_image.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bkri-f0p--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_EA40404FBBCC4B6AC68C86E59D06B777193FAD00C474FA40A98AAE13F8E620D5_1638058810499_image.png" alt="" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, click on the “LET’S START” button. This will create your account and take you to the Strapi admin UI, which you will use for development configurations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--V7kAPV3w--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_EA40404FBBCC4B6AC68C86E59D06B777193FAD00C474FA40A98AAE13F8E620D5_1638062668087_image.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--V7kAPV3w--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_EA40404FBBCC4B6AC68C86E59D06B777193FAD00C474FA40A98AAE13F8E620D5_1638062668087_image.png" alt="" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn’t it amazing how you moved from &lt;code&gt;yarn create&lt;/code&gt; to having a dashboard where you can create your very own API pretty soon?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, you are ready to use the awesome powers of Strapi in &lt;strong&gt;building an API for blog posts&lt;/strong&gt;. Let’s proceed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#designing-the-data-structure"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Designing the Data Structure
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, we are going to start creating the data structure for our API. We can do this by creating content-types. The first content type we will build is for posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to the &lt;code&gt;Content-Types Builder&lt;/code&gt; section and click on &lt;code&gt;Create new collection type&lt;/code&gt;. A modal will appear, where you will enter &lt;code&gt;post&lt;/code&gt; as the display name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Content-Types Builder allows to create and update content-types: single and collection types. &lt;a href="https://strapi.io/documentation/user-docs/latest/content-types-builder/creating-new-content-type.html#creating-a-new-content-type"&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, a modal will appear which you will use to create the fields for the &lt;code&gt;post&lt;/code&gt; content-type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmm, what fields does a blog post always have… Let’s create the following ones:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; with type &lt;strong&gt;Text&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;required&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; with type &lt;strong&gt;Rich Text&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;required&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;image&lt;/code&gt; with type &lt;strong&gt;Media&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;Single image&lt;/strong&gt;) and (&lt;strong&gt;required&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;author&lt;/code&gt; with type &lt;strong&gt;Text&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;required&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you have a &lt;code&gt;post&lt;/code&gt; content-type with 4 fields - Text, Rich Text, Media, and Text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hit &lt;strong&gt;Finish&lt;/strong&gt;, then &lt;strong&gt;Save&lt;/strong&gt;! Here you go, your first content-type has been created, and you have successfully created the schema for a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schemas help to implement the database’s design. Database schemas are the blueprints that help developers visualize how databases should be built. They provide a reference point that indicates what fields of information the project contains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hdsGrC0H--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_EA40404FBBCC4B6AC68C86E59D06B777193FAD00C474FA40A98AAE13F8E620D5_1638113888351_image.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hdsGrC0H--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_EA40404FBBCC4B6AC68C86E59D06B777193FAD00C474FA40A98AAE13F8E620D5_1638113888351_image.png" alt="" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, on the sidebar, we will see the “COLLECTION TYPES” section and if you go to the post section, you’ll find there are currently no posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can create a brand new post by clicking &lt;strong&gt;Add new posts&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll see that you are provided with a CMS for inputting data. Go ahead and fill up the fields (title, featured image, author, content) with information about the first post you’d like to add to your database. You can add lots of posts if you’d like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then hit &lt;strong&gt;Save&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Publish&lt;/strong&gt;. A screenshot of mine is shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hqeKCx_v--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_EA40404FBBCC4B6AC68C86E59D06B777193FAD00C474FA40A98AAE13F8E620D5_1638114103028_image.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hqeKCx_v--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_EA40404FBBCC4B6AC68C86E59D06B777193FAD00C474FA40A98AAE13F8E620D5_1638114103028_image.png" alt="" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To view the &lt;code&gt;posts&lt;/code&gt; API, visit &lt;a href="http://localhost:1337/posts"&gt;localhost:1337/posts&lt;/a&gt;. P.s.: Notice it pluralized the name of the collection type that we had set initially - post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will get a status 403 - forbidden error, as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xNcSecHi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_EA40404FBBCC4B6AC68C86E59D06B777193FAD00C474FA40A98AAE13F8E620D5_1638105741189_image.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xNcSecHi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_EA40404FBBCC4B6AC68C86E59D06B777193FAD00C474FA40A98AAE13F8E620D5_1638105741189_image.png" alt="" width="553" height="230"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s because we attempted to view the API as an unauthenticated user, and by default, viewing an API requires authentication. To make posts public, we have to grant read-access to the post content-type. To do this, head to the dashboard and under the “GENERAL” section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on the &lt;strong&gt;Settings&lt;/strong&gt; then &lt;strong&gt;Roles &amp;amp; Permission&lt;/strong&gt; and click on the &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; role.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the article &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;findone&lt;/code&gt; options under permission and save.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these, you have permitted a public user to get all posts &lt;code&gt;**GET**&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;/posts&lt;/code&gt;, and also get a single post &lt;code&gt;**GET**&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;/posts/:id&lt;/code&gt;; something so similar to the REST API GET method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then hit &lt;strong&gt;Save&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if we head over to &lt;a href="http://localhost:1337/posts"&gt;localhost:1337/posts&lt;/a&gt; you should now see all your posts from the post endpoint this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Ft5QWZhi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_EA40404FBBCC4B6AC68C86E59D06B777193FAD00C474FA40A98AAE13F8E620D5_1638114178599_image.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Ft5QWZhi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_EA40404FBBCC4B6AC68C86E59D06B777193FAD00C474FA40A98AAE13F8E620D5_1638114178599_image.png" alt="" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can access created endpoints with REST API methods, because by default, Strapi provides our endpoints via REST, but later in this article, I will show you how endpoints can be accessed via GraphQL&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the project folder, the &lt;code&gt;./api/**/config/routes.json&lt;/code&gt; files define all available endpoints for the clients. By default, Strapi generates endpoints for all your Content Types. &lt;a href="https://strapi.io/documentation/developer-docs/latest/development/backend-customization.html#routing"&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like we’re making progress. Doesn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have created a post, the content is stored in your database so that you can have access to your data when you need to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look through the &lt;code&gt;posts&lt;/code&gt; endpoint, you’d notice that one other benefit of Strapi is that it supports image optimization too. You are given the ability to render different image formats including thumbnail, large, medium, and small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Strapi, you also don’t have to go through the stress of building out an MVC project structure - creating a database, database connections, models, etc. Here, it’s all done under the hood for you. We’ll have a look at that pretty soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isn’t it beautiful to see that we are making headway?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in your IDE, you will now see that a &lt;code&gt;./api/posts/&lt;/code&gt; folder has been created in the project folder, which is a reflection of the &lt;code&gt;posts&lt;/code&gt; endpoint you created on the admin panel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the models folder, the &lt;code&gt;posts.settings.json&lt;/code&gt; file defines the &lt;code&gt;post&lt;/code&gt; schema that you created, as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--E7xrterz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_EA40404FBBCC4B6AC68C86E59D06B777193FAD00C474FA40A98AAE13F8E620D5_1638116163053_image.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--E7xrterz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_EA40404FBBCC4B6AC68C86E59D06B777193FAD00C474FA40A98AAE13F8E620D5_1638116163053_image.png" alt="" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As your app grows -- the more content-types(endpoints) you add up, the more folders are created in the api directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, note that image uploads are stored in the &lt;code&gt;public/uploads&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I feel it makes huge sense that all of your code corresponds to all actions made on the dashboard. What do you think?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#understanding-and-using-relations-in-strapi"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Understanding and using relations in Strapi
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you have a collection of videos, and for each blog post; a video should be embedded within. To establish a connection between a video from the videos collection and its associated blog post, you first have to learn how to use relations in Strapi. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relation-type fields added to a content-type from the Content-Types Builder allow to establish a relation with another content-type - mandatorily a collection type. These fields are called "relational fields".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our new-found knowledge, let’s go ahead and create the video collection - to demonstrate how to set up relations in Strapi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to the &lt;code&gt;Content-Types Builder&lt;/code&gt; section and click on &lt;code&gt;Create new collection type&lt;/code&gt;. Enter &lt;code&gt;video&lt;/code&gt; as the display name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_jCVrl4I--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_EA40404FBBCC4B6AC68C86E59D06B777193FAD00C474FA40A98AAE13F8E620D5_1638116918626_image.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_jCVrl4I--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_EA40404FBBCC4B6AC68C86E59D06B777193FAD00C474FA40A98AAE13F8E620D5_1638116918626_image.png" alt="" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then add the following field for the video content-type:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;url&lt;/code&gt; with type &lt;strong&gt;Text&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;required&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hit &lt;strong&gt;Finish&lt;/strong&gt;, then &lt;strong&gt;Save&lt;/strong&gt;! Now, your second content-type has been created, and you have successfully created the schema for a video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To continue, grab a video URL, perhaps the one for your favorite YouTube video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we want to create a link between the post collection and the video collection, we also need to add a new field called &lt;code&gt;video&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;Posts&lt;/code&gt; collection. The field type for this would be &lt;strong&gt;Relation&lt;/strong&gt;, and we can choose the kind of relationship we want between &lt;code&gt;posts&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;videos&lt;/code&gt; (by selecting any of the 6 options), to keep things simple in this demonstration, we’ll choose the one to one relationship where a post has a video, as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: For a field to be a relation, it has to be a collection type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bGL_d3MW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_EA40404FBBCC4B6AC68C86E59D06B777193FAD00C474FA40A98AAE13F8E620D5_1638117989452_image.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bGL_d3MW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_EA40404FBBCC4B6AC68C86E59D06B777193FAD00C474FA40A98AAE13F8E620D5_1638117989452_image.png" alt="" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hit the &lt;strong&gt;Finish&lt;/strong&gt; button when you’re done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now your post schema should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tGleTUOd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_EA40404FBBCC4B6AC68C86E59D06B777193FAD00C474FA40A98AAE13F8E620D5_1638118149661_image.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tGleTUOd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_EA40404FBBCC4B6AC68C86E59D06B777193FAD00C474FA40A98AAE13F8E620D5_1638118149661_image.png" alt="" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these, the video field in the &lt;code&gt;Posts&lt;/code&gt; collection has a relation with the &lt;code&gt;Videos&lt;/code&gt; collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To continue, navigate to the &lt;strong&gt;Videos&lt;/strong&gt; sections under the “COLLECTION TYPES” in your dashboard, then click the &lt;strong&gt;Add New Video&lt;/strong&gt; button to add a video to your &lt;code&gt;Videos&lt;/code&gt; collection as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fkMbqsYY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_EA40404FBBCC4B6AC68C86E59D06B777193FAD00C474FA40A98AAE13F8E620D5_1638118476871_image.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fkMbqsYY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_EA40404FBBCC4B6AC68C86E59D06B777193FAD00C474FA40A98AAE13F8E620D5_1638118476871_image.png" alt="" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hit &lt;strong&gt;Save&lt;/strong&gt;, then &lt;strong&gt;Publish&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the video added, we can now link it with a blog post, by heading to the post of choice in the Posts collection, clicking the &lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt; button, and selecting the video URL you’d like to add to that post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tadaa! If you visit &lt;a href="http://localhost:1337/posts"&gt;localhost:1337/posts&lt;/a&gt; on your browser, you will see that the &lt;code&gt;posts&lt;/code&gt; endpoint has been updated and the video has been added to the post where you included it, as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--h9EuD-03--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_EA40404FBBCC4B6AC68C86E59D06B777193FAD00C474FA40A98AAE13F8E620D5_1638120192039_image.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--h9EuD-03--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_EA40404FBBCC4B6AC68C86E59D06B777193FAD00C474FA40A98AAE13F8E620D5_1638120192039_image.png" alt="" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="#delivering-faster-with-graphql-and-strapi"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Delivering faster with GraphQL and Strapi
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delivering applications faster is always a top priority. In this section, you will learn how to easily query your data through a generated GraphQL schema.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get started with GraphQL in your app, you first have to install the plugin by running the following command in your project directory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn strapi install graphql
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the GraphQL plugin installed, you will be able to add a GraphQL endpoint to fetch and mutate your content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restart the app using:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn develop
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you visit &lt;a href="http://localhost:1337/graphql"&gt;localhost:1337/graphql&lt;/a&gt; in your browser, you should see the interface (&lt;strong&gt;GraphQL Playground&lt;/strong&gt;) that will help you to write a GraphQL query to explore your data&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8ZZyT2Bb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_EA40404FBBCC4B6AC68C86E59D06B777193FAD00C474FA40A98AAE13F8E620D5_1638202593800_image.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8ZZyT2Bb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_EA40404FBBCC4B6AC68C86E59D06B777193FAD00C474FA40A98AAE13F8E620D5_1638202593800_image.png" alt="" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to access the id, title, url of the featured image, author, and url of the video for blog posts, you can write the query as I’ve shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Ew3RId3Z--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ooigo66dg7l79utur7ma.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Ew3RId3Z--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ooigo66dg7l79utur7ma.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were able to grab data pretty fast and conveniently! Also, using the sidebar, you can have a peek at your schema. Awesome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, you learned how fast, easy to use, and powerful Strapi is for building APIs. Setting up our backend was super seamless. Just create your collections and Strapi generates RESTful endpoints by default, or if you’d prefer to use GraphQL endpoints, simply install the plugin. All of these, using best web practices. Awesome stuff, indeed!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SafeCloset, a Secret Safe - Why and how I made it in Rust </title>
      <author>Denys Séguret</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 18:00:18 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/dystroy/safecloset-a-secret-safe-why-and-how-i-made-it-in-rust-2k47</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/dystroy/safecloset-a-secret-safe-why-and-how-i-made-it-in-rust-2k47</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like everybody, I have small secrets to store, like door codes, some passwords, where I buried the body, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They must be kept away from other eyes but, more importantly, they must be available, even if I'm traveling far from my computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they must be easily backed up without risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, I've dealt with such secret storage with various solutions, like having files decrypted, edited with my favorite editor, then encrypted again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were full of weaknesses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;temporary clear files that could be inadvertently backed up, or staying here if I had to leave or in case of crash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;editor weaknesses, like backup files and plugins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OS specificity making them inaccessible when far from my computers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The temporary clear files where the most dangerous problem. I've had to hunt for my clear files after a badly parameterized backup rule.&lt;br&gt;
Editor plugins were a real threat too, especially as I started using an AI plugin storing whole extracts of my texts for better auto-completion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I had to find or build better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The obvious requirements for my new solution were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an encrypted storage file, with a strong algorithm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a storage format making it possible to keep the file on non secure disks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a multi-platform application, that can be easily carried too&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;totally open-source, so that the program can be fixed or rewritten&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no clear file ever created, no data sent to external API, so the application is an editor too&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pure Rust, to avoid most nasty bugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I added a few less obvious requirements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easy fuzzy key search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fast opening, instant closing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;auto-closing (dead man switch)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;focus on ergonomics, I want to feel comfortable editing in the application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in case I inadvertently become a secret agent:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;plausible deniability by putting drawers (storage units) inside other ones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;non observability of deep drawers (having several versions of the file doesn't let you know whether there were changes and in which deep drawer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let's see the technical choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#programming-language-rust"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Programming language: Rust
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said, this was obvious to me. Such program can't really be written today in another language. Rust doesn't prevent all bugs, but it makes it possible to avoid the nasty ones which stay hidden and compromise security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cryptographic-algorithm-and-library-aesgcm"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cryptographic algorithm and library : AES-GCM
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never considered rolling my own algorithm or using a lightly tested library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I choose an AEDS crate from the RustCrypto group: &lt;a href="https://github.com/RustCrypto/AEADs/tree/master/aes-gcm-siv"&gt;AES-GCM in its SIV variant&lt;/a&gt; (the SIV variant isn't really needed but it doesn't cost much).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#file-format"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  File format
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minimal unit of secret in SafeCloset is an &lt;em&gt;entry&lt;/em&gt;, which is made of  a name and a value, for example "VISA Card code" and "9875".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entries are stored together in a &lt;em&gt;drawer&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SafeCloset uses the metaphor of &lt;em&gt;closets&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;drawers&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
A SafeCloset file contains something which is called a &lt;em&gt;closet&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
A &lt;em&gt;closet&lt;/em&gt; contains several &lt;em&gt;drawers&lt;/em&gt;. Each drawer is separately encrypted, with its own passphrase (and nonce).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A drawer also contains a closet, which contains deeper drawers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure plausible deniability, drawers are automatically created, including deep ones, and nothing distinguishes drawers that you created and you can open from the ones which were automatically created and that you can't open (you could if you knew their password but they aren't displayed on creation and they only contain random bytes anyway).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawers are serialized using the &lt;a href="https://serde.rs/"&gt;serde&lt;/a&gt; crate which is kind of standard in the Rust world and is very convenient. For the encoding format, I choose &lt;a href="https://msgpack.org/index.html"&gt;MessagePack&lt;/a&gt; which, like JSON, allows field addition but is much more compact. Having optional fields is very important to allow evolution of the file format while ensuring old files will stay compatible with newer versions of the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combining the chosen encryption scheme and the serialization encoding with the list of structures and fields, the complete file format is described in the &lt;a href="https://dystroy.org/safecloset/community/#storage-format"&gt;community page&lt;/a&gt; to allow replacement of the application if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#making-an-ui-in-the-terminal"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Making an UI in the terminal
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many low level libraries whose features go from the basic (and easy) task of coloring and styling the text you print in the terminal to handling events, terminal size, alternate screen, etc. I personally like &lt;a href="https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm"&gt;Crossterm&lt;/a&gt; which is cross platform and well designed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I combine it with &lt;a href="https://github.com/Canop/termimad/"&gt;Termimad&lt;/a&gt;, a crate I made to manage skins, generate texts without mixing the style and the content, handle text inputs, even with wide characters, and a lot of small TUI related problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Termimad allows fancy things like editing texts in small areas of your terminal and fading the view behind the menus or dialogs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--M71XjnL0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dystroy.org/safecloset/img/menu.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--M71XjnL0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dystroy.org/safecloset/img/menu.png" alt="the fancy color fading" width="562" height="356"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the author of Termimad I feel comfortable to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; recommend you use it for your own TUI. Not that it's bad, I like it, but it's a strange beast covering much more than what a library should do, and at a much lower level than your typical framework. If you're not used to low level TUI libraries and well versed in Rust, I suggest you look at other higher level TUI crates.&lt;br&gt;
If you still hesitate, come to &lt;a href="https://miaou.dystroy.org/3768"&gt;my chat&lt;/a&gt; and I'll tell you whether Termimad might be the right choice for your application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-result-safecloset"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The result: SafeCloset
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here it is: &lt;a href="https://dystroy.org/safecloset/"&gt;https://dystroy.org/safecloset/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I may say so, I'd say SafeCloset is convenient and pleasant to use.&lt;br&gt;
It lets me find and read my secrets in a few keystrokes.&lt;br&gt;
And it seems to be the most secure solution I ever used.&lt;br&gt;
I designed it to be intuitive for other users too, and I hope I succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better introduce it,  I made a website explaining how it works, how to install it, how to use it: &lt;a href="https://dystroy.org/safecloset/"&gt;https://dystroy.org/safecloset/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current version is a candidate for a release as 1.0, there's nothing important missing right now, but I'll let some time run to be sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd welcome your opinion!&lt;/p&gt;
