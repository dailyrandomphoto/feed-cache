      <guid>https://dev.to/aciklab/how-to-install-pardus-gnome-21-15gm</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pardus-21x"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Pardus 21.x
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pardus 21 was released on August 21, 2021! Pardus 21 was released in 3 different environments as XFCE, GNOME and Server. Version 21.x will receive 5 minor updates over approximately 2 years and will be "Supported" until May 1, 2025&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#downloading-pardus-21-gnome-iso"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Downloading Pardus 21 GNOME ISO
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://www.pardus.org.tr/surumler/"&gt;download&lt;/a&gt; the GNOME desktop environment ISO disk image of the Pardus 21.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jutic66o--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/puvuegfzb1qfbaqowxe7.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jutic66o--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/puvuegfzb1qfbaqowxe7.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installing-pardus-21"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installing Pardus 21
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can reach the following screen by starting your Pardus 21 ISO in various virtual or physical environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EpumblCS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/e76z33ji4ksllqgu4vn0.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EpumblCS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/e76z33ji4ksllqgu4vn0.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After choosing the language setting on the relevant screen, it would be appropriate to select "Pardus Live" to open an environment that you can use to test your own computer with the Pardus operating system. Of course, if this media is running on a USB stick or similar environment, it will obviously be slower in speed, so it will be more efficient after the actual installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uTrjVN-_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wmpnf624a07nbxmvjpu2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uTrjVN-_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wmpnf624a07nbxmvjpu2.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When "Pardus Live" is opened, an empty GNOME like the one below will welcome you. Then you can switch to the Installation Wizard with the "Install Pardus" icon on the desktop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Iu2DiY91--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/357w2ov9ycwfiwmoqq2w.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Iu2DiY91--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/357w2ov9ycwfiwmoqq2w.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following steps, you can go through the Language, Time Zone and Keyboard selection steps according to your wishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pyB1mDZW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rwafu7u8grmbyix09hup.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pyB1mDZW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rwafu7u8grmbyix09hup.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dbvmCyEz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/an4r8wzgu59b8mykkk53.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dbvmCyEz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/an4r8wzgu59b8mykkk53.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6DpPDif_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gzrx78l67wrfo1xrotxm.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6DpPDif_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gzrx78l67wrfo1xrotxm.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this step, "name", "username" and "password" must be entered for the local administrator account with "sudo" on your system. On the same screen, you are also asked to type the "computer name".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3I87IJFm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/p6io7ly307rjaeupnnx2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3I87IJFm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/p6io7ly307rjaeupnnx2.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then comes the most important step, how to do the disk partitioning. If you are using another operating system on your disk or if you want to partition manually, you have to do it manually, but in this article we will apply the situation on a blank disk. Therefore, you need to select the disk you want to install in the "Manual Partitioning" option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TvgkClCa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/eawfyl8rfrfsuwjuycdk.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TvgkClCa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/eawfyl8rfrfsuwjuycdk.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It warns you again that all data on the disk will be deleted when you make the selection and proceed. Indeed, this is the most important step. If you have data to lose, you need to be careful. If you're using a virtual machine, it won't delete anything from your real physical machine. After this step, if you haven't made any adjustments to your disk, it will ask one more question and just say "Yes".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--d5Ykfz5x--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8i1qkfuaim3lu00150d4.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--d5Ykfz5x--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8i1qkfuaim3lu00150d4.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XdzoFxha--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c3b8pfttzkpqi9i5hawb.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XdzoFxha--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c3b8pfttzkpqi9i5hawb.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the summary part of the installation will be shared with you. Up until this step, nothing has been done about the installation except erasing the disk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XpczEG7W--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bzdhful8ff5i9ampitub.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XpczEG7W--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bzdhful8ff5i9ampitub.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as you click Next, the installation will begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---YfS40Cp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7iyiga3c2y49g09i3vh6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---YfS40Cp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7iyiga3c2y49g09i3vh6.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This step, which will vary depending on your SSD or HDD disk performance, will take between 2-10 minutes. Then the reboot screen will appear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5AvueNYN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vf5kmysv95ydor8ewqp8.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5AvueNYN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vf5kmysv95ydor8ewqp8.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the new version of Pardus, the GRUB login screen has also become a successful design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1Phc1JVh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2porhd5vtyhg3wki0l3o.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1Phc1JVh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2porhd5vtyhg3wki0l3o.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, when you see the GDM screen open, your installation has been completed successfully. You can start your session with the "your password" you entered during installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bHStZjij--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1tcset89cqe5og534rq7.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bHStZjij--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1tcset89cqe5og534rq7.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After starting the session, the "Welcome application" appears and you can organize your desktop according to your own taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kEvSkbSj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/brv7vkr61qoav65qnili.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kEvSkbSj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/brv7vkr61qoav65qnili.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a good time...&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Differences between Javascript and NodeJs</title>
      <author>Maria Antonella 🦋</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 22 Aug 2021 15:50:39 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/antoomartini/differences-between-javascript-and-nodejs-27m4</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/antoomartini/differences-between-javascript-and-nodejs-27m4</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At first it was hard for me to understand the differences because for me, they were the same thing. It was all javascript. But then, I started to understand what each one was used for. For this reason, I share it :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☘ JavaScript is a language that runs inside web browsers as part of the documents loaded by the browser and is used as a client-side development language. It provides the behavior of the pages. Like HTML it provides the semantic structure and CSS the look and feel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, being an interpreted language, it needs an interpreter to run. V8 is Google Chrome's JS engine and 'node' is a front-end that can be used to run JavaScript scripts outside the browser. In other words: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☘  NodeJs is an open source, cross-platform environment that allows you to create server-side applications and tools using JavaScript. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short list of comparisons 🧐💻:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;JS
🔴 Can only be run in the browsers
🔴 Used on the client-side
🔴 Capable enough to add HTML and play with the DOM
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;NodeJs
🟡 Can be run outside the browser
🟡 Used on the server-side.
🟡 Does not have the capability to add HTML tags
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GCP: &lt;a href="https://www.gcp-examquestions.com"&gt;https://www.gcp-examquestions.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Company static website hosted on Amazon S3 was launched recently and is being used. Currently users are experiencing 503 services unavailable errors. Why are these errors occuring?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;A. The request rate to Amazon S3 is too high
B. There is an error with the Amazon RDS database.
C. The requests to Amazon S3 do not have the proper permissions
D. The users are in a different geographical region and Amazon Route53 is restricting access
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer: A&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Company is releasing a new static website hosted on Amazon S3. However, upon navigating to the site, the following error messages is received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;403 Forbidden - Access Denied
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What change should be made to fix this error?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;A. Add a bucket policy that grants everyone read access to the bucket
B. Add a bucket policy that grants everyone read access to the bucket objects
C. Remove the default bucket policy that denies read access to the bucket
D. Configure cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) on the bucket
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer: B&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A company has created an online retail application that is hosted on a fleet of EC2 instances behind of ELB application load balancer, authentication is handled at the individual EC2 instance level. Once a user is authenticated, all request have go to the same EC2 instance. What should the SysOps Administrator enable to meet these requirements?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;A. ELB TCP listeners
B. ELB Sticky Sessions
C. ELB connection draining
D. ELB cross-zone load balancing
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer: B&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A SysOps Administrator is managing a large organization with multiple accounts on the Business Support plan all linked to a single payer account. The Administrator wants to be notified automatically of AWS Personal Health Dashboard events. In the main payer account, the Administrator configures Amazon CloudWatch Events triggered by AWS Health events to issue notifications using Amazon SNS, but alerts in the linked accounts failed to trigger. Why did the alerts fail?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;A. Amazon SNS cannot be triggered from the AWS Personal health Dashboard
B. The AWS personal health dashboard only reports events from one a account, not linked account
C. The AWS Personal Health Dashboard must be configured from the payer account only; all events will then roll up into the payer account.
D. AWS Organizations must be used to monitor linked accounts.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer: B&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The security team has decided that there will be no public internet access to HTTP (TCP port 80 ) because it is moving to HTTPS for all incoming web traffic. The team had asked a SysOps Administrator to provide a report on any security groups that are not compliant. What should the AWS SysOps Administrator do to provide near real time compliance reporting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;A. Enable AWS Trusted Advisor and show the security team that the security groups unrestricted access will check alarm
B. Schedule and AWS lambda function to run hourly to scan and evaluate all security groups and send report to the security team.
C. Use AWS config to enable the restricted common port rule and add port 80 to parameters
D. Use Amazon Inspector to evaluate the security groups during scans, and send the completed reports to the Security team.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer: A&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the shared responsibility model, for which of the following Amazon EC2 activities is AWS responsible? (Choose two.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;A. Patching the guest operating system
B. Monitoring memory utilization
C. Configuring network ACLs
D. Patching the hypervisor
E. Maintaining network infrastructure
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer: D E&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A company use of AWS Cloud services is quickly growing, so a SysOps Administrator has been asked to generate details of daily spending to share with management. Which method should the Administrator choose to produce this data?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;A. Share the monthly AWS bill with management.
B. Use AWS CloudTrail Logs to access daily costs in JSON format.
C. Set up daily Cost and Usage Report and download the output from Amazon S3.
D. Monitor AWS costs with Amazon Cloud Watch and create billing alerts and notifications.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer: C&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A SysOps Administrator is managing an application that runs on Amazon EC2 instances behind and application load balancer. The instances run in an Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones. The applications stores data in Amazon RDS MySQL DB instance. The Administrator must ensure that that application stays available if the database becomes unresponsive. How can these requirements be met?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;A. Create read replicas for the RDS database and use them in case of a database failure.
B. Create a new RDS instance from the snapshot of the original RDS instance if a failure occurs.

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A solutions architect has been assigned to migrate a 50 TB Oracle data warehouse that contains sales data from on-premises to Amazon Redshift. Major updates to the sales data occur on the final calendar day of the month. For the remainder of the month, the data warehouse only receives minor daily updates and is primarily used for reading and reporting. Because of this, the migration process must start on the first day of the month and must be complete before the next set of updates occur. This provides approximately 30 days to complete the migration and ensure that the minor daily changes have been synchronized with the Amazon Redshift data warehouse. Because the migration cannot impact normal business network operations, the bandwidth allocated to the migration for moving data over the internet is 50 Mbps. The company wants to keep data migration costs low. Which steps will allow the solutions architect to perform the migration within the specified timeline?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;       A. Install Oracle database software on an Amazon EC2 instance. Configure VPN connectivity between AWS and the company’s data center. Configure the Oracle database running on Amazon EC2 to join the Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC). When the Oracle database on Amazon EC2 finishes synchronizing, create an AWS DMS ongoing replication task to migrate the data from the Oracle database on Amazon EC2 to Amazon Redshift. Verify the data migration is complete and perform the cut over to Amazon Redshift.
       B. Create an AWS Snowball import job. Export a backup of the Oracle data warehouse. Copy the exported data to the Snowball device. Return the Snowball device to AWS. Create an Amazon RDS for Oracle database and restore the backup file to that RDS instance. Create an AWS DMS task to migrate the data from the RDS for Oracle database to Amazon Redshift. Copy daily incremental backups from Oracle in the data center to the RDS for Oracle database over the internet. Verify the data migration is complete and perform the cut over to Amazon Redshift.
       C. Install Oracle database software on an Amazon EC2 instance. To minimize the migration time, configure VPN connectivity between AWS and the company’s data center by provisioning a 1 Gbps AWS Direct Connect connection. Configure the Oracle database running on Amazon EC2 to be a read replica of the data center Oracle database. Start the synchronization process between the company’s on-premises data center and the Oracle database on Amazon EC2. When the Oracle database on Amazon EC2 is synchronized with the on-premises database, create an AWS DMS ongoing replication task to migrate the data from the Oracle database read replica that is running on Amazon EC2 to Amazon Redshift. Verify the data migration is complete and perform the cut over to Amazon Redshift.
       D. Create an AWS Snowball import job. Configure a server in the company’s data center with an extraction agent. Use AWS SCT to manage the extraction agent and convert the Oracle schema to an Amazon Redshift schema. Create a new project in AWS SCT using the registered data extraction agent. Create a local task and an AWS DMS task in AWS SCT with replication of ongoing changes. Copy data to the Snowball device and return the Snowball device to AWS. Allow AWS DMS to copy data from Amazon S3 to Amazon Redshift. Verify that the data migration is complete and perform the cut over to Amazon Redshift.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A company has a primary Amazon S3 bucket that receives thousands of objects every day. The company needs to replicate these objects into several other S3 buckets from various AWS accounts. A solutions architect is designing a new AWS Lambda function that is triggered when an object is created in the main bucket and replicates the object into the target buckets. The objects do not need to be replicated in real time. There is concern that this function may impact other critical Lambda functions due to Lambda’s regional concurrency limit. How can the solutions architect ensure this new Lambda function will not impact other critical Lambda functions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;       A. Set the new Lambda function reserved concurrency limit to ensure the executions do not impact other critical Lambda functions. Monitor existing critical Lambda functions with Amazon CloudWatch alarms for the Throttles Lambda metric.
       B. Increase the execution timeout of the new Lambda function to 5 minutes. Monitor existing critical Lambda functions with Amazon CloudWatch alarms for the Throttles Lambda metric.
       C. Configure S3 event notifications to add events to an Amazon SQS queue in a separate account. Create the new Lambda function in the same account as the SQS queue and trigger the function when a message arrives in the queue.
       D. Ensure the new Lambda function implements an exponential backoff algorithm. Monitor existing critical Lambda functions with Amazon CloudWatch alarms for the Throttles Lambda metric.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A financial services company receives a regular data feed from its credit card servicing partner. Approximately 5,000 records are sent every 15 minutes in plaintext, delivered over HTTPS directly into an Amazon S3 bucket with server-side encryption. This feed contains sensitive credit card primary account number (PAN) data. The company needs to automatically mask the PAN before sending the data to another S3 bucket for additional internal processing. The company also needs to remove and merge specific fields, and then transform the record into JSON format. Additionally, extra feeds are likely to be added in the future, so any design needs to be easily expandable. Which solutions will meet these requirements?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;       A. Trigger an AWS Lambda function on file delivery that extracts each record and writes it to an Amazon SQS queue. Trigger another Lambda function when new messages arrive in the SQS queue to process the records, writing the results to a temporary location in Amazon S3. Trigger a final Lambda function once the SQS queue is empty to transform the records into JSON format and send the results to another S3 bucket for internal processing.
       B. Trigger an AWS Lambda function on file delivery that extracts each record and writes it to an Amazon SQS queue. Configure an AWS Fargate container application to automatically scale to a single instance when the SQS queue contains messages. Have the application process each record, and transform the record into JSON format. When the queue is empty, send the results to another S3 bucket for internal processing and scale down the AWS Fargate instance.
       C. Create an AWS Glue crawler and custom classifier based on the data feed formats and build a table definition to match. Trigger an AWS Lambda function on file delivery to start an AWS Glue ETL job to transform the entire record according to the processing and transformation requirements. Define the output format as JSON. Once complete, have the ETL job send the results to another S3 bucket for internal processing.
       D. Create an AWS Glue crawler and custom classifier based upon the data feed formats and build a table definition to match. Perform an Amazon Athena query on file delivery to start an Amazon EMR ETL job to transform the entire record according to the processing and transformation requirements. Define the output format as JSON. Once complete, send the results to another S3 bucket for internal processing and scale down the EMR cluster.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A company has a web application that uses Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and Amazon DynamoDB. A recent marketing campaign has increased demand. Monitoring software reports that many requests have significantly longer response times than before the marketing campaign. A solutions architect enabled Amazon CloudWatch Logs for API Gateway and noticed that errors are occurring on 20% of the requests. In CloudWatch, the Lambda function Throttles metric represents 1% of the requests and the Errors metric represents 10% of the requests. Application logs indicate that, when errors occur, there is a call to DynamoDB. What change should the solutions architect make to improve the current response times as the web application becomes more popular?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;       A. Increase the concurrency limit of the Lambda function
       B. Implement DynamoDB auto scaling on the table
       C. Increase the API Gateway throttle limit

&lt;p&gt;A solutions architect has an operational workload deployed on Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group. The VPC architecture spans two Availability Zones (AZ) with a subnet in each that the Auto Scaling group is targeting. The VPC is connected to an on-premises environment and connectivity cannot be interrupted. The maximum size of the Auto Scaling group is 20 instances in service. The VPC IPv4 addressing is as follows:&lt;br&gt;
– VPC CIDR: 10.0.0.0/23&lt;br&gt;
– AZ1 subnet CIDR: 10.0.0.0/24&lt;br&gt;
– AZ2 subnet CIDR: 10.0.1.0/24&lt;br&gt;
Since deployment, a third AZ has become available in the Region. The solutions architect wants to adopt the new AZ without adding additional IPv4 address space and without service downtime. Which solution will meet these requirements?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;       A. Update the Auto Scaling group to use the AZ2 subnet only. Delete and re-create the AZ1 subnet using half the previous address space. Adjust the Auto Scaling group to also use the new AZ1 subnet. When the instances are healthy, adjust the Auto Scaling group to use the AZ1 subnet only. Remove the current AZ2 subnet. Create a new AZ2 subnet using the second half of the address space from the original AZ1 subnet. Create a new AZ3 subnet using half the original AZ2 subnet address space, then update the Auto Scaling group to target all three new subnets.
       B. Terminate the EC2 instances in the AZ1 subnet. Delete and re-create the AZ1 subnet using half the address space. Update the Auto Scaling group to use this new subnet. Repeat this for the second AZ. Define a new subnet in AZ3, then update the Auto Scaling group to target all three new subnets.
       C. Create a new VPC with the same IPv4 address space and define three subnets, with one for each AZ. Update the existing Auto Scaling group to target the new subnets in the new VPC.
       D. Update the Auto Scaling group to use the AZ2 subnet only. Update the AZ1 subnet to have the previous address space. Adjust the Auto Scaling group to also use the AZ1 subnet again. When the instances are healthy, adjust the Auto Scaling group to use the AZ1 subnet only. Update the current AZ2 subnet and assign the second half of the address space from the original AZ1 subnet. Create a new AZ3 subnet using half the original AZ2 subnet address space, then update the Auto Scaling group to target all three new subnets.

      <guid>https://dev.to/wizardhealth/effortlessly-install-tailwindcss-in-a-rails-app-with-webpack-minimum-configuration-14gg</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A while back &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhh"&gt;DHH&lt;/a&gt; decided to created a &lt;a href="https://github.com/rails/tailwindcss-rails"&gt;gem&lt;/a&gt; for easily installing TailwindCss into rails apps 🙌🏻. This gem could be used to install Tailwind through the asset pipeline as well as using webpack. This &lt;a href="https://github.com/rails/tailwindcss-rails/issues/62#issuecomment-900193727"&gt;changed&lt;/a&gt; later on as contributors wanted to focus their attention to what was the heart of the gem 🥺.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/d10dMmzqCYqQ0/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/d10dMmzqCYqQ0/giphy.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, since a lot of people used this gem to get a new Rails app going with Tailwind without the hassle of configuring everything from scratch (including colleagues from my company), &lt;a href="https://dev.to/wizardhealth"&gt;we decided&lt;/a&gt; to create a &lt;a href="https://github.com/WizardComputer/tailwindcss-rails-webpacker"&gt;new gem&lt;/a&gt; 🎉. This gem installs Tailwind with Webpack and has production purging enabled. Other Webpack specific problems are to be addressed as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A company is using Amazon Aurora MySQL for a customer relationship management (CRM) application. The application requires frequent maintenance on the database and the Amazon EC2 instances on which the application runs. For AWS Management Console access, the system administrators authenticate against AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) using an internal identity provider. For database access, each system administrator has a user name and password that have previously been configured within the database. A recent security audit revealed that the database passwords are not frequently rotated. The company wants to replace the passwords with temporary credentials using the company’s existing AWS access controls. Which set of options will meet the company’s requirements?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;       A. Create a new AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store entry for each database password. Enable parameter expiration to invoke an AWS Lambda function to perform password rotation by updating the parameter value. Create an IAM policy allowing each system administrator to retrieve their current password from the Parameter Store. Use the AWS CLI to retrieve credentials when connecting to the database.
       B. Create a new AWS Secrets Manager entry for each database password. Configure password rotation for each secret using an AWS Lambda function in the same VPC as the database cluster. Create an IAM policy allowing each system administrator to retrieve their current password. Use the AWS CLI to retrieve credentials when connecting to the database.
       C. Enable IAM database authentication on the database. Attach an IAM policy to each system administrator’s role to map the role to the database user name.

&lt;p&gt;A financial services company runs more than 400 core-banking microservices on AWS, using services including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2). Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS). and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). The company also segregates parts of its infrastructure using separate AWS accounts, so if one account is compromised, critical parts of the infrastructure in other accounts remain unaffected. The bank uses one account for production, one for non-production, and one for storing and managing users’ login information and roles within AWS. The privileges that are assigned in the user account then allow users to read or write to production and non-production accounts. The company has set up “AWS Organizations” to manage several of these scenarios. The company wants to provide shared and centrally-managed VPCs to all business units for certain applications that need a high degree of interconnectivity. As a solutions architect, which of the following options would you choose to facilitate this use-case?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A project uses two AWS accounts for accessing various AWS services. The engineering team has just configured an Amazon S3 bucket in the first AWS account for writing data from the Amazon Redshift cluster provisioned in the second AWS account. The team has noticed that the files created in the S3 bucket using UNLOAD command from the Redshift cluster are not accessible to the users present in the same AWS account as the S3 bucket. What could be the reason for this denial of permission for resources belonging to the same AWS account?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;       A. By default an S3 object is owned by the AWS account that uploaded it So the S3 bucket owner will not implicitly have access to the objects written by Redshift cluster.
       B. When objects are uploaded to S3 bucket from a different AWS account the S3 bucket owner will get implicit permissions to access these objects. It is an upload error that can be fixed by providing manual access from AWS console.
       C. When two different AWS accounts are accessing an S3 bucket, both the accounts need to share the bucket policies, explicitly defining the actions possible for each account An erroneous policy can lead to such permission failures.
       D. The owner of an S3 bucket has implicit access to all objects in his bucket Permissions are set on objects after they are completely copied to the target location Since the owner is unable to access the uploaded files, it is possible that the write operation is still in progress.

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A silicon valley based unicorn startup recently launched a video-sharing social networking service called KitKot. The startup uses AWS Cloud to manage the IT infrastructure. Users upload video files up to 1 GB in size to a single EC2 instance based application server which stores them on a shared EFS file system. Another set of EC2 instances managed via an Auto Scaling group. periodically scans the EFS share directory for new files to process and generate new videos (for thumbnails and composite visual effects) according to the video processing instructions that are uploaded alongside the raw video files. Post-processing, the raw video files are deleted from the EFS file system and the results are stored in an S3 bucket. Links to the processed video files are sent via in-app notifications to the users. The startup has recently found that even as more instances are added to the Auto Scaling Group, many files are processed twice, therefore image processing speed is not improved. As an AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional, what would you recommend to improve the reliability of the solution as well as eliminate the redundant processing of video files?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;       A. Create an hourly cron job on the application server to synchronize the contents of the EFS share with S3. Trigger a Lambda function every time a file is uploaded to S3 and process the video file to store the results in another S3 bucket. Once the file is processed leverage CloudWatch Events to trigger an SNS notification to send an in-app notification to the user containing the links to the processed files.
       B. Refactor the application to run from Amazon 53 instead of the EFS file system and upload the video files directly to an S3 bucket via an API Gateway based REST APL Configure an S3 trigger to invoke a Lambda function each time a file is uploaded and the Lambda in turn processes the video and stores the processed files in another bucket. Leverage CloudWatch Events to trigger an SNS notification to send an in-app notification to the user containing the links to the processed files.
       C. Refactor the application to run from S3 instead of EFS and upload the video files directly to an S3 bucket. Configure an S3 trigger to invoke a Lambda function on each video file upload to S3 that puts a message in an SQS queue containing the link and the video processing instructions. Change the video processing application to read from the SQS queue and the S3 bucket. Configure the queue depth metric to scale the size of the Auto Scaling group for video processing instances. Leverage CloudWatch Events to trigger an SNS notification to the user containing the links to the processed files.
       D. Refactor the application to run from S3 instead of EFS and upload the video files directly to an S3 bucket. Set CloudWatch Events to trigger a Lambda function on each file upload that puts a message in an SQS queue containing the link and the video processing instructions. Change the video processing application to read from SQS queue for new files and configure the queue depth metric to scale instances in the video processing Auto Scaling group. Leverage CloudWatch Events to trigger an SNS notification to the user containing the links to the processed files.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A leading car information and shopping platform helps more than 20 million web and mobile users each month browse automobile dealer inventory. read vehicle reviews, and consume other automobile-related content by leveraging its library of 50 million vehicle photos uploaded by auto dealers. The company is planning a key update with even better image quality and faster load times on the company’s website as well as mobile apps but the existing image-handling solution based on Cloudera MapReduce clusters is not the right tool for the job. The company now wants to switch to a serverless solution on AWS Cloud. As part of this process, the engineering team has been studying various best practices for serverless solutions. They intend to use AWS Lambda extensively and are looking at the salient features to consider when using Lambda as the backbone for the serverless architecture. As a Solutions Architect Professional, which of the following would you identify as key considerations for a serverless architecture? (Select three)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;       A. Since Lambda functions can scale extremely quickly, it’s a good idea to deploy a CloudWatch Alarm that notifies your team when function metrics such as ConcurrentExecutions or Invocations exceeds the expected threshold.
       B. Lambda allocates compute power in proportion to the memory you allocate to your function. AWS, thus recommends to over provision your function time out settings for the proper performance of Lambda functions.
       C. The bigger your deployment package, the slower your Lambda function will cold-start. Hence, AWS suggests packaging dependencies as a separate package from the actual Lambda package.
       D. If you intend to reuse code in more than one Lambda function, you should consider creating a Lambda Layer for the reusable code.
       E. Serverless architecture and containers complement each other and you should leverage Docker containers within the Lambda functions
       F. By default Lambda functions always operate from an AWS-owned VPC and hence have access to any public internet address or public AWS APIs. Once a Lambda function is VPC-enabled it will need a route through a NAT gateway in a public subnet to access public resources.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A marketing research company has developed a tracking system that collects user behavior during web marketing campaigns on behalf of their customers all over the world. The tracking system consists of an auto-scaled group of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances behind an elastic load balancer (ELB), and the collected data is stored in Amazon DynamoDB. After the campaign is terminated, the tracking system is torn down and the data is moved to Amazon Redshift, where it is aggregated, analyzed and used to generate detailed reports. The company wants to be able to instantiate new tracking systems in any region without any manual intervention and therefore adopted AWS CloudFormation. What needs to be done to make sure that the AWS CloudFormation template works in every AWS region? (Choose 2 answers)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;       A. Avoid using DeletionPolicies for EBS snapshots
       B. The names of the Amazon DynamoDB tables must be different in every target region
       C. Use the built-in Mappings and FindInMap functions of AWS CloudFormation to refer to the AMI ID set in the ImageId attribute of the Auto Scaling::LaunchConfiguration resource
       D. IAM users with the right to start AWS CloudFormation stacks must be defined for every target region.
       E. Use the built-in function of AWS CloudFormation to set the AvailabilityZone attribute of the ELB resource

&lt;p&gt;A development team that is currently doing a nightly six-hour build which is lengthening over time on-premises with a large and mostly underutilized server would like to transition to a continuous integration model of development on AWS with multiple builds triggered within the same day. However, they areare concerned about cost, security, and how to integrate with existing on-premises applications such as their LDAP and email servers which cannot move off-premises. The development environment needs a source code repository, a project management system with a MySQL database, resources for performing the builds, and a storage location for QA to pick up builds from. What AWS services combination would you recommend to meet the development team’s requirements?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;       A. A Bastion host Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance running a VPN server for access from on-premises, Amazon EC2 for the source code repository with attached Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes, Amazon EC2 and Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) MySQL for the project management system, EIPs for the source code repository and project management system, Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) for a build queue, An Auto Scaling group of Amazon EC2 instances for performing builds, and Amazon Simple Email Service for sending the build output

&lt;li&gt;A large enterprise wants to adopt CloudFormation to automate administrative tasks and implement the security principles of least priviledge and separation of duties. They have identified the following roles with the corresponding tasks in the company:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Network administrators: create, modify and delete VPCs, subnets, NACLs, routing tables, and security groups application operators: deploy complete application stacks (ELB, Auto-Scaling groups, RDS) whereas all resources must be deployed in the VPCs managed by the network administrators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both groups must maintain their own CloudFormation templates and should be able to create, update and delete only their own CloudFormation stacks. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has followed your advice to create two IAM groups, one for applications and one for - networks. Both IAM groups are attached to IAM policies that grant rights to perform the necessary task of each group as well as the creation, update and deletion of CloudFormation stacks. &lt;br&gt;
Given setup and requirements, which statements represent valid design considerations? Choose 2 answers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;       A. Network stack updates will fail upon attempts to delete a subnet with EC2 instances
       B. Restricting the launch of EC2 instances into VPCs requires resource level permissions in the IAM policy of the application group
       C. Nesting network stacks within application stacks simplifies management and debugging, but requires resource level permissions in the IAM policy of the network group
       D. Unless resource level permissions are used on the cloudformation:DeleteStack action, network administrators could tear down application stacks
       E. The application stack cannot be deleted before all network stacks are deleted
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer: E&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A document storage company is deploying their application to AWS and changing their business model to support both Free Tier and Premium Tier users. The Premium Tier &lt;br&gt;
users will be allowed to store up to 200GB of data and Free Tier customers will be allowed to store only 5GB. The customer expects that billions of files will be stored. All users need to be alerted when approaching 75 percent quota utilization and again at 90 percent quota use. To support the Free Tier and Premium Tier users, how should they architect their application?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;       A. The company should utilize an Amazon Simple Workflow Service activity worker that updates the userˈs used data counter in Amazon DynamoDB. The Activity Worker will use Simple Email Service to send an email if the counter increases above the appropriate thresholds.
       B. The company should deploy an Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) relational database with a stored objects table that has a row for each stored object along with the size of each object. The upload server will query the aggregate consumption of the user in question (by first determining the files stored by the user, and then querying the stored objects table for respective file sizes) and send an email via Amazon Simple Email Service if the thresholds are breached.
       C. The company should write both the content length and the username of the files owner as S3 metadata for the object. They should then create a a file watcher to iterate over each object and aggregate the size for each user and send a notification via Amazon Simple Queue Service to an emailing service if the storage threshold is exceeded
       D. The company should create two separate Amazon Simple Storage Service buckets, one for data storage for Free Tier Users, and another for data storage for Premium Tier users. An Amazon Simple Workflow Service activity worker will query all objects for a given user based on the bucket the data is stored in and aggregate storage. The activity worker will notify the user via Amazon Simple Notification Service when necessary.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A public archives organization is about to move a pilot application they are running on AWS into production. You have been hired to analyze their application architecture and give cost-saving recommendations. The application displays scanned historical documents. Each document is split into individual image tiles at multiple zoom levels to improve responsiveness and ease of use for the end users. At maximum zoom level the average document will be 8000x 6000 pixels in size, split into multiple 40pxx 40px image tiles. The tiles are batch processed by Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, and put into an Amazon Simple Storage Service(S3) bucket.A browser-based JavaScript viewer fetches tiles from the Amazon (S3) bucket and displays them to users as they zoom and pan around each document. The average storage size of all zoom levels for a document is approximately 30MB of JPEG tiles. Originals of each document are archived in Amazon Glacier. The company expects to process and host over 500,000 scanned documents in the first year. What are your recommendations? Choose 3 answers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;       A. Deploy an Amazon CloudFront distribution in front of the Amazon S3 tiles bucket
       B. Increase the size (width/height) of the individual tiles at the maximum zoom level
       C. Store the maximum zoom level in the low cost Amazon S3 Glacier option and only retrieve the most frequently access tiles as they are requested by users.
       D. Use Amazon S3 Reduced Redundancy Storage for each zoom level.
       E. Decrease the size (width/height) of the individual tiles at the maximum zoom level.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your multi-national customer wants to rewrite a website portal to “take advantage of AWS best practices”. Other information that you have for this large Enterprise customer is as follows:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part of the portal is an employee-only section, and authentication must be against the corporate Active Directory.
• You used a web analytics website to discover that on average there were 140,000 visitors per month over the past year, a peak of 187,000 unique visitors last month, and a minimum of 109,000 unique visitors two months ago. You have no information about what percentage of these visitors represents employees who signed into the portal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The web analytics website also revealed that traffic breakdown is 40 percent South America, 50 percent North America, and 10 percent other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The customer’s primary data center is located in Sao Paulo Brazil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their chief technology officer believes that response time for logging in to the employee portal is a primary metric, because employees complain that the current website is too slow in this regard.&lt;br&gt;
When you present your proposed application architecture to the customer, which of the following should you propose as part of the architecture? Choose 3 answers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;       A. A three-subnet VPC, with an AD controller in the AWS region. The AWS AD controller will be part of the primary AD controller’s forest, and will synchronize with the corporate controller over a dedicated pipe to the corporate data center
       B. Do not use Amazon CloudFront, because the employees who log in to the portal have unique (private) session data that should not be cached in a content delivery network.
       C. A three-subnet VPC, with all AD calls traversing a dedicated pipe to the corporate data center
       D. Establish the AWS presence in the US-EAST region, with a dedicated pipe to the corporate data center.
       E. Establish the AWS presence in multiple regions: SA-EAST, and also US-EAST, with a dedicated pipe from both SA-EAST and US-EAST to the corporate data center – and also a dedicated connection between regions. Replicate data as needed between the regions. Use a geo load balancer to determine which region is primary for a given user.
       F. Use Amazon CloudFront to cache pages for users at the nearest edge location.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A gaming company adopted AWS Cloud Formation to automate load-testing of their games. They have created an AWS Cloud Formation template for each gaming environment and one for the load-testing stack. The load-testing stack creates an Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) Postgres database and two web servers running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) that send HTTP requests, measure response times, and write the results into the database. A test run usually takes between 15 and 30 minutes. Once the tests are done, the AWS CloudFormation stacks are torn down immediately. The test results written to the Amazon RDS database must remain accessible for visualization and analysis. Select possible solutions that allow access to the test results after the AWS Cloud Formation load-testing stack is deleted. Choose 2 answers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;       A. Define an update policy to prevent deletion of the Amazon RDS database after the AWS CloudFormation stack is deleted.
       B. Define a deletion policy of type Snapshot for the Amazon RDS resource to assure that the RDS database can be restored after the AWS CloudFormation stack is deleted.

&lt;p&gt;You are an architect for a news-sharing mobile application. Anywhere in the world, your users can see local news on topics they choose. They can post pictures and videos from inside the application. Since the application is being used on a mobile phone, connection stability is required for uploading content, and delivery should be quick. Content is accessed a lot in the first minutes after it has been posted, but is quickly replaced by new content before disappearing. The local nature of the news means that 90 percent of the uploaded content is then read locally (less than a hundred kilometers from where it was posted). What solution will optimize the user experience when users upload and view content (by minimizing page load times and minimizing upload times)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;       A. Upload and store the content in a central Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket, and use an Amazon CloudFront Distribution for content delivery.
       B. Upload and store the content in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket in the region closest to the user, and use multiple Amazon CloudFront distributions for content delivery
       C. Upload the content to an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance in the region closest to the user, send the content to a central Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket, and use an Amazon CloudFront distribution for content delivery.
       D. Use an Amazon CloudFront distribution for uploading the content to a central Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket and for content delivery.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your company currently has a highly available web application running in production. The application’s web front-end utilizes an Elastic Load Balancerand Auto Scaling across three Availability Zones.During peak load, your web servers operate at 90% utilization and leverage a combination of Heavy Utilization Reserved Instances for steady state load and On-Demand and Spot Instances for peak load. You are tasked with designing a cost effective architecture to allow the application to recover quickly in the event that an Availability Zoneis unavailable during peak load. Which option provides the most cost effective high availability architectural design for this application?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;       A. Continue to run your web front-end at 90% utilization, but leverage a high bid price strategy to cover the loss of any of the other Availability Zones during peak load.
       B. Increase use of spot instances to cost effectively scale the web front-end across all Availability Zones to lower aggregate utilization levels that will allow an Availability Zone to fail during peak load without affecting the application’s availability.
       C. Increase Auto Scaling capacity and scaling thresholds to allow the web front-end to cost effectively scale across all Availability Zones to lower aggregate utilization levels that will allow an Availability Zone to fail during peak load without affecting the application’s availability.
       D. Continue to run your web front-end at 90% utilization, but purchase an appropriate number of light utilization RIs in each Availability Zone to cover the loss of any of the other Availability Zones during peak load.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Enterprise customer is starting their migration to the cloud, their main reason for migrating is agility, and they want to make their internal Microsoft Active Directory available to any applications running on AWS; this is so internal users only have to remember one set of credentials and as a central point of user control for leavers and joiners. How could they make their Active Directory secure, and highly available, with minimal on-premises infrastructure changes, in the most cost and time-efficient way? Choose the most appropriate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;       A. Using Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), they could create a DMZ using a security group; within the security group they could provision two smaller Amazon EC2 instances that are running Openswan for resilient IPSEC tunnels, and two larger instances that are domain controllers; they would use multiple Availability Zones
       B. Using VPC, they could create an extension to their data center and make use of resilient hardware IPSEC tunnels; they could then have two domain controller instances that are joined to their existing domain and reside within different subnets, in different Availability Zones.
       C. Within the customerˈs existing infrastructure, they could provision new hardware to run Active Directory Federation Services; this would present Active Directory as a SAML2 endpoint on the internet; any new application on AWS could be written to authenticate using SAML2.
       D. The customer could create a stand-alone VPC with its own Active Directory Domain Controllers; two domain controller instances could be configured, one in each Availability Zone; new applications would authenticate with those domain controllers.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer: B&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An AWS customer is deploying a web application that is composed of a front-end running on Amazon EC2 and confidential data that is stored on Amazon S3. The customers security policy requires that the all access operations to this sensitive data must be authenticated and authorized by a centralized access management system that is operated by a separate security team. In addition, the web application team that owns and administers the EC2 web front-end instances is prohibited from having any ability to access the data that circumvents this centralized access management system. Which of the following configurations will support these requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;       A. Configure the web application to authenticate end-users against the centralized access management system. Have the web application provision trusted users STS tokens entitling the download of approved data directly from Amazon S3.
       B. Encrypt the data on Amazon S3 using a CloudHSM that is operated by the separate security team. Configure the web application to integrate with the CloudHSM for decrypting approved data access operations for trusted end-users.
       C. Configure the web application to authenticate end-users against the centralized access management system using SAML. Have the end-users authenticate to IAM using their SAML token and download the approved data directly from Amazon S3.
       D. Have the separate security team create an IAM Role that is entitled to access the data on Amazon S3. Have the web application team provision their instances with this Role while denying their IAM users access to the data on Amazon S3.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have been asked to design network connectivity between your existing data centers and AWS. Your application’s EC2 instances must be able to connect to existing backend resources located in your data center. Network traffic between AWS and your data centers will start small, but ramp up to 10s of GB per second over the course of several months. The success of your application is dependent upon getting to market quickly. Which of the following design options will allow you to meet your objectives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;       A. Quickly submit a DirectConnect request to provision a 1 Gbps cross connect between your data center and VPC, then increase the number or size of your DirectConnect connections as needed
       B. Quickly create an internal ELB for your backend applications, submit a DirectConnect request to provision a 1 Gbps cross connect between your data center and VPC, then increase the number or size of your DirectConnect connections as needed
       C. Allocate EIPs and an Internet Gateway for your VPC instances to use for quick, temporary access to your backend applications, then provision a VPN connection between a VPC and existing on-premises equipment.
       D. Provision a VPN connection between a VPC and existing on-premises equipment, submit a DirectConnect partner request to provision cross connects between your data center and the DirectConnect location, then cut over from the VPN connection to one or more DirectConnect connections as needed.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer: D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have an application running on an EC2 instance which will allow users to download files from a private S3 bucket using a pre-signed URL. Before generating the URL, the application should verify the existence of the file in S3. How should the application use AWS credentials to access the S3 bucket securely?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;       A. Create an IAM user for the application with permissions that allow list access to the S3 bucket; launch the instance as the IAM user, and retrieve the IAM user’s credentials from the EC2 instance user data.
       B. Create an IAM role for EC2 that allows list access to objects in the S3 bucket; launch the instance with the role, and retrieve the role’s credentials from the EC2 instance metadata
       C. Use the AWS account access keys; the application retrieves the credentials from the source code of the application.
       D. Create an IAM user for the application with permissions that allow list access to the S3 bucket; the application retrieves the IAM user credentials from a temporary directory with permissions that allow read access only to the application user.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A startup deploys its photo-sharing site in a VPC. An elastic load balancer distributes web traffic across two subnets. The load balancer session stickiness is configured to use the AWS-generated session cookie, with a session TTL of 5 minutes. The web server Auto Scaling group is configured as min-size=4, max-size=4. The startup is preparing for a public launch, by running load-testing software installed on a single Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance running in us-west-2a. After 60 minutes of load-testing, the web server logs show the following:&lt;br&gt;
+———————-+————————-+&lt;br&gt;
| # of HTTP requests | # of HTTP requests |&lt;br&gt;
WEBSERVER LOGS | from load-tester | from private beta users |&lt;br&gt;
+—————————————|———————-|————————-+&lt;br&gt;
| webserver #1 (subnet in us-west-2a): | 19,210 | 434 |&lt;br&gt;
| webserver #2 (subnet in us-west-2a): | 21,790 | 490 |&lt;br&gt;
| webserver #3 (subnet in us-west-2b): | 0 | 410 |&lt;br&gt;
| webserver #4 (subnet in us-west-2b): | 0 | 428 |&lt;br&gt;
+—————————————+———————-+————————-+&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;       A. Which recommendations can help ensure that load-testing HTTP requests are evenly distributed across the four webservers?
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose 2 answers&lt;br&gt;
           B. Launch and run the load-tester Amazon EC2 instance from us-east-1 instead.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To meet regulatory requirements, a pharmaceuticals company needs to archive data after a drug trial test is concluded. Each drug trial test may generate up to several thousands of files, with compressed file sizes ranging from 1 byte to 100MB. Once archived, data rarely needs to be restored, and on the rare occasion when restoration is needed, the company has 24 hours to restore specific files that match certain metadata. Searches must be possible by numeric file ID, drug name, participant names, date ranges, and other metadata. Which is the most cost-effective architectural approach that can meet the requirements?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;       A. Store individual compressed files and search metadata in Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). Create a lifecycle rule to move the data to Amazon Glacier, after a certain number of days. When restoring data, query the Amazon S3 bucket for files matching the search criteria, and retrieve the file to S3 reduced redundancy in order to move it back to S3 Standard class.
       B. Store individual files in Amazon Glacier, using the file ID as the archive name. When restoring data, query the Amazon Glacier vault for files matching the search criteria.
       C. First, compress and then concatenate all files for a completed drug trial test into a single Amazon Glacier archive. Store the associated byte ranges for the compressed files along with other search metadata in an Amazon RDS database with regular snapshotting. When restoring data, query the RDS database for files that match the search criteria, and create restored files from the retrieved byte ranges
       D. Store individual files in Amazon S3, and store search metadata in an Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) multi-AZ database. Create a lifecycle rule to move the data to Amazon Glacier after a certain number of days. When restoring data, query the Amazon RDS database for files matching the search criteria, and move the files matching the search criteria back to S3 Standard class.
       E. Store individual files in Amazon Glacier, and store the search metadata in an Amazon RDS multi-AZ database. When restoring data, query the Amazon RDS database for files matching the search criteria, and retrieve the archive name that matches the file ID returned from the database query.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A media production company wants to deliver high-definition raw video material for preproduction and dubbing to customers all around the world. They would like to use Amazon CloudFront for their scenario, and they require the ability to limit downloads per customer and video file to a configurable number. A CloudFront download distribution with TTL = 0 was already setup to make sure all client HTTP requests hit an authentication backend on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)/Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) first, which is responsible for restricting the number of downloads. Content is stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) and configured to be accessible only via CloudFront. What else needs to be done to achieve an architecture that meets the requirements? Choose 2 answers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;       A. Enable CloudFront logging into an Amazon S3 bucket, leverage Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR) to analyze CloudFront logs to determine the number of downloads per customer, and return the content S3 URL unless the download limit is reached.
       B. Enable CloudFront logging into an Amazon S3 bucket, let the authentication backend determine the number of downloads per customer by parsing those logs, and return the content S3 URL unless the download limit is reached
       C. Enable URL parameter forwarding, let the authentication backend count the number of downloads per customer in Amazon RDS, and return the content S3 URL unless the download limit is reached
       D. Configure a list of trusted signers, let the authentication backend count the number of download requests per customer in Amazon RDS, and return a dynamically signed URL unless the download limit is reached.
       E. Enable URL parameter forwarding, let the authentication backend count the number of downloads per customer in Amazon RDS, and invalidate the CloudFront distribution as soon as the download limit is reached.

&lt;p&gt;Your company runs a complex customer relations management system that consists of around 10 different software components all backed by the same Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) database. You adopted AWS OpsWorks to simplify management and deployment of that application and created an AWS OpsWorks stack with layers for each of the individual components. An internal security policy requires that all instances should run on the latest Amazon Linux AMI and that instances must be replaced within one month after the latest Amazon Linux AMI has been released. AMI replacements should be done without incurring application downtime or capacity problems. You decide to write a script to be run as soon as a new Amazon Linux AMI is released. Which solutions support the security policy and meet your requirements? Choose 2 answers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;       A. Create a new stack and layers with identical configuration, add instances with the latest Amazon Linux AMI specified as a custom AMI to the new layers, switch DNS to the new stack, and tear down the old stack
       B. Identify all Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances of your AWS OpsWorks stack, stop each instance, replace the AMI ID property with the ID of the latest Amazon Linux AMI ID, and restart the instance. To avoid down time, make sure not more than one instance is stopped at the same time.
       C. Specify the latest Amazon Linux AMI as a custom AMI at the stack level, terminate instances of the stack and let AWS OpsWorks launch new instances with the new AMI.
       D. Add new instances with the latest Amazon Linux AMI specified as a custom AMI to all AWS OpsWorks layers of your stack, and terminate the old ones.
       E. Assign a custom recipe to each layer which replaces the underlying AMI. Use AWS OpsWorks life-cycle events to incrementally execute this custom recipe and update the instances with the new AMI.

&lt;p&gt;Your company sells consumer devices and needs to record the first activation of all sold devices. Devices are not activated until the information is written on a persistent database. Activation data is very important for your company and must be analyzed daily with a MapReduce job. The execution time of the data analysis process must be less than three hours per day. Devices are usually sold evenly during the year, but when a new device model is out, there is a predictable peak in activations, that is, for a few days there are 10 times or even 100 times more activations than in the average day. Which of the following databases and analysis framework would you implement to better optimize costs and performance for this workload?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;       A. Amazon Relational Database Service and Amazon Elastic MapReduce with Spot Instances

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A customer is in the process of deploying multiple applications to AWS that are owned and operated by different development teams. Each development team maintains the authorization offits users independently from other teams. The customerˈs information security team would like to be able to delegate user authorization to the individual development teams but independently apply restrictions to the users permissions based on factors such as the userˈs device and location . For example, the information security team would like to grant read-only permissions to a user who is defined by the development team as read/write whenever the user is authenticating from outside the corporate network. What steps can the information security team take to implement this capability?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;       A. Operate an authentication service that generates AWS Security Token Service (STS) tokens with IAM policies from application-defined IAM roles.
       B. Add additional IAM policies to the application IAM roles that deny user privileges based on information security policy.
       C. Enable federation with the internal LDAP directory and grant the application teams permissions to modify users.
       D. Configure IAM policies that restrict modification of the application IAM roles only to the information security team.

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your company has been contracted to develop and operate a website that tracks NBA basketball statistics. Statistical data to derive reports like “best game-winning shots from the regular season” and more frequently built reports like “top shots of the game” need to be stored durably for repeated lookup. Leveraging social media techniques, NBA fans submit and vote on new report types from the existing data set so the system needs to accommodate variability in data queries and new static reports must be generated and posted daily. Initial research in the design phase indicates that there will be over 3 million report queries on game day by end users and other applications that use this application as a data source. It is expected that this system will gain in popularity over time and reach peaks of 10-15 million report queries of the system on game days. Select the answer that will allow your application to best meet these requirements while minimizing costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;       A. Launch a multi-AZ MySQL Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) Read Replica connected to your multi AZ master database and generate reports by querying the Read Replica. Perform a daily table cleanup.
       B. Generate reports from a multi-AZ MySQL Amazon RDS deployment and have an offline task put reports in Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) and use CloudFront to cache the content. Use a TTL to expire objects daily.
       C. Implement a multi-AZ MySQL RDS deployment and have the application generate reports from Amazon ElastiCache for in-memory performance results. Utilize the default expire parameter for items in the cache.
       D. Query a multi-AZ MySQL RDS instance and store the results in a DynamoDB table. Generate reports from the DynamoDB table. Remove stale tables daily.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer: B&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Youˈve been tasked with moving an ecommerce web application from a customerˈs datacenter into a VPC. The application must be fault tolerant and well as highly scalable. Moreover, the customer is adamant that service interruptions not affect the user experience. As you near launch, you discover that the application currently uses multicast to share session state between web servers. In order to handle session state within the VPC, you choose to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;       A. Store session state in Amazon ElastiCache for Redis
       B. Enable session stickiness via Elastic Load Balancing
       C. Create a mesh VPN between instances and allow multicast on it.
       D. Store session state in Amazon Relational Database Service
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your application is leveraging IAM Roles for EC2 for accessing objects stored in S3. Which two of the following IAM policies control access to your S3 objects?&lt;br&gt;
Choose 2 answers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;       A. An IAM trust policy allows the EC2 instance to assume an EC2 instance role
       B. An IAM access policy allows the EC2 role to access S3 objects
       C. An IAM bucket policy allows the EC2 role to access S3 objects
       D. An IAM trust policy allows applications running on the EC2 instance to assume an EC2 role
       E. An IAM trust policy allows applications running on the EC2 instance to access S3 objects
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer: A B&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are designing Internet connectivity for your VPC. The Web servers must be available on the Internet. The application must have a highly available architecture. Which alternatives should you consider? Choose 2 answers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;       A. Configure ELB with an EIP. Place all your Web servers behind ELB. Configure a Route53 A record that points to the EIP.
       B. Place all your Web servers behind ELB. Configure a Route53 CNAME to point to the ELB DNS name.
       C. Configure a CloudFront distribution and configure the origin to point to the private IP addresses of your Web servers. Configure a Route53 CNAME record to your CloudFront distribution.
       D. Configure a NAT instance in your VPC. Create a default route via the NAT instance and associate it with all subnets. Configure a DNS A record that points to the NAT Instance public IP address.
       E. Assign EIPs to all Web servers. Configure a Route53 record set with all EIPs, with health checks and DNS failover.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer: B E&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/davethebrit/injecting-pre-rendered-widgets-content-2bjb</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi! First time member and post. I had a question that I tried to find an answer for, but likely wasn't searching the right terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have two teams building React experiences. One who is building the core page, and another that owns widget experiences (think carousels that are componentized, have data and specific logic attached). Is there a concept within React of "injecting" these carousels into the body of a page? Does this impact SSR, performance or security?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many thanks in advance&lt;/p&gt;
