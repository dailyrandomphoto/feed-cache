      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a developer, we all deal with plenty of recommendations, various options to choose and having no idea what to choose. One of the most common aspects that provide you job opportunities, having a high number of clients and income is your skills as a developer. This includes what you know or what you must know. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"What CSS framework should I know? " Have you ever heard this question or have you ever asked yourself this question? If yes! You are welcome, we are going to discuss it in this article, if not! You will. Therefore, let's explore it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've started my styling journey with CSS, and it was so great for me to create basic things even changing the background colour, however, it was too tedious to write lots of words. At the same time, I got many recommendations about bootstrap and when I start learning bootstrap, it was tough but I liked it. Bootstrap was so cool because everything that I needed was ready. I recently moved to tailwind and, it's also too great for me, I will discuss why I left CSS or bootstrap and What to choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;** No need to overthink, all involve a simple mechanism of adding style to your project and, we discuss what to choose.**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#css"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  CSS
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language, it is very simple and easy for developers and, almost all beginners choose it. It is easy to become familiar with CSS and play around but, it takes much more time to master it. However, you do not need to be proficient in CSS, even just learning basics like page layouts, colours, and fonts is enough to get a job and make money, the next reason for learning CSS is that it improves your project speed as you use only the particular styles that you need. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might think " If it is easy to learn and I can get a job then why do I need to learn other frameworks?" &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, Using CSS is great but the reason I do not use CSS most of the time is that I had to write many lines of code for each page or simply it is really time-consuming especially when you have less time to complete your project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn't work always the same for all the browsers even sometimes doesn't work at all which is a headache for many developers, specifically when they need to test the compatibility, running of a  program across multiple browsers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#bootstrap"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Bootstrap
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bootstrap is a front end development framework. It is a massive collection of reusable and versatile pieces of code which are written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Everything in bootstrap is ready and one of the reasons to learn bootstrap is that it has a responsive suction and is supported by many communities. Bootstrap allows you to design a website easier and faster and includes design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to use bootstrap on your project, you have to add all its CSS files even if you don't need them, and this will slow down your website. Bootstrap is still one of the most popular CSS frameworks and developers prefer to use it. I personally found it difficult at the starting, but It works great once you become familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tailwind-css"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tailwind CSS
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework used for building user interfaces. It is also one of the most popular CSS frameworks and is used by many developers. The difference between bootstrap and TailwindCSS is that Bootstrap provide styled component like button, nav etc while tailwind provide styled classes like flex, text-centre and rotate-90 etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only does it speed up production, but it offers so much flexibility and customisation being so low-level. Unlike Bootstrap, you are free to give any look you want for your project as you use only the style you need and the HTML will be styled too fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Tailwind CSS and HTML should be written together, it is hard to read and sometimes confuses developers while reading the code. It takes time to learn Tailwind as there are many classes and it doesn't include components too, therefore a developer must style the components which are already styled in Bootstrap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might already decide what to learn. There is no way to select a particular one as the best. Each of them is very popular and widely used by developers. It totally depends on you, the project you work on and your client preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is always advised to start with CSS if you are a beginner because it is simple or If you have less time and don't want to write many lines of code then Bootsrap is the best option and if you want more control over your style and if the HTML, CSS mixed code doesn't confuse you, go with Tailwind CSS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Let me know what CSS Framework do you use and why? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's all for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading, I hope you found this article useful.&lt;/p&gt;

Did you know that there are only four categories (News&amp;amp;Politics, Science&amp;amp;Tech, Howto&amp;amp;Style, and Gaming) that are listed in the advanced search functions? &lt;br&gt;
So, if your video is posted under any other category, it wouldn't be found if category searching is involved!&lt;br&gt;
A general description rule of thumb: too short and too lengthy descriptions are not recommended. Use keywords wisely within a moderately sized description that actually describes your video. (Some people include the most irrelevant video descriptions imaginable. Don't be one of them!).YouTube allows roughly 22 words for the description displayed on the query page. So, it's your best bet to ensure that your keywords are at the beginning of your description.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.Use your own material or any of YouTube's audio tracks collection. The last thing you need is to be penalized for using copyright material!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.If you're putting a link in your video description, start it with HTTP:// before the URL. It won't work otherwise!&lt;br&gt;
Become YouTube savvy by exploring YouTube API and YouTube RSS Feeds. You will be glad you did.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My freelancing strategy</title>
      <author>Pasca Vlad</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 10:18:10 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/pascavld/my-freelancing-strategy-5065</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/pascavld/my-freelancing-strategy-5065</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you found value in this thread you will most likely enjoy my tweets too so make sure you follow me on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VladPasca5"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;  for more information about web development and how to improve as a developer. This article was first published on my &lt;a href="https://vladpasca.hashnode.dev/"&gt;Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started freelancing 2 months ago&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime I:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Built over 50 landing pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Made websites for 5 well-known accounts in my niche&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Got my first paid client&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And today I'll share my strategy with you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let's clarify some things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My niche is Twitter course/content creators who sell on Gumroad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The service I sell is web design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use @carrd to build the landing pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let's talk about the strategy I use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How I find my potential clients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know most of them already from Twitter but I also did this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Searched on Gumroad for courses that are promoted on Twitter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at the accounts other Gumroad creators follow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, it took longer to find them but now I...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;just scroll through my timeline and find new potential clients every time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, here is something very important&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I find a potential client I&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add their name is a notion doc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend 10 minutes reading their tweets, and learning more about them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second point 2 is key&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do I do next?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't like the "traditional" way of doing outreach where you just ask a person to work with you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that leading with value is key&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is exactly what I'm doing. How?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I'm building an entire landing page for them...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I do that before even talking with them&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do have some templates and systems that I use to save time but it still requires quite some work to build that landing page&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, only after I have the landing page I do the outreach which is step 3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The outreach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is quite simple, I have a DM template that I use and I just personalize them for every client&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also mention that they can use the landing page for free in the DM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the most important part is FOLLOWING UP&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trust me...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the clients I got replied after I followed up&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, after they reply I transfer the website to them and let me know that I'll ask for a testimonial after a while&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because this is what I'm aiming for right now, the social proof&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll think about the money later&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that's mainly all of it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I repeat the exact same steps for each potential client&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some decide to work with me in the future, some send me a testimonial, some also pay me for my work and some don't reply&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter the results I'm happy because I enjoy what I'm doing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I hope found this useful and if you did please let me know. If you have any questions feel free to DM me on  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VladPasca5"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;._let me know. If you have any questions feel free to DM me on  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VladPasca5"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>10 best practices to make switching cloud providers less painful</title>
      <author>CAST AI</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 09:42:31 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/castai/10-best-practices-to-make-switching-cloud-providers-less-painful-43m6</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/castai/10-best-practices-to-make-switching-cloud-providers-less-painful-43m6</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Switching from one cloud provider to another is like opening Pandora’s box of infrastructure challenges, egress costs, and pricing commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re using multiple cloud providers, sooner or later you’ll realize the value of building an open-source, portable infrastructure you can smoothly move to another vendor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote a guide to help you navigate this part of the cloud landscape:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#shouldiswitchtoanothercloudprovider"&gt;Should I switch to another cloud provider at all?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#protectyourbusinessagainstslabreaches"&gt;Protect your business against occasional SLA breaches&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="#switchtoanothercloudprovider"&gt;And if it’s still not working, switch to another cloud service provider&lt;/a&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#goopensource"&gt;Go open source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#usecontainers"&gt;Use containers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#automatedevops"&gt;Automate DevOps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#findfeatureparity"&gt;Find feature parity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#getyourdataoutthesmartway"&gt;Get your data out the smart way&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#usealoadbalancingsolution"&gt;Use a load balancing solution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#waituntilyourcommitmentsexpire"&gt;Wait until your commitments expire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#havearollbackplan"&gt;Have a rollback plan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#chooseyournewproviderwisely"&gt;Choose your new provider wisely&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#buildadisasterrecoverystrategy"&gt;Build a Disaster Recovery/downtime avoidance strategy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="shouldiswitchtoanothercloudprovider"&gt;Should I switch to another cloud provider at all?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have a good reason to switch - you probably shouldn’t. Here’s how to tell if your cloud provider is living up to the promised service level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qC6sFhty--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cast.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1080x1080.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qC6sFhty--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cast.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1080x1080.jpg" alt="Is your cloud provider living up to the promised service level"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay attention to downtimes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the most prominent vendors like AWS or Azure experience outages once in a while. But if you spot a few significant ones on the public status pages, it’s clear that the provider is overlooking some aspect of their infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get concerned if you see major incidents that lead to downtimes for large portions of regional or global services, causing customer application downtimes. They’re usually hard to miss thanks to getting reported all over the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note all the API errors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some providers might be struggling to keep up with their scale. One side effect of that is more IaaS control plane API errors (5xx). Another warning sign is an increase in IaaS control plane API latency. What does this mean? APIs return fine, but they take longer to execute each operation. Reliable cloud providers should actually provide you with historical latency numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check vendor capacity &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you see “out of capacity” errors for compute and other resources, it’s a sign that specific regions are under-resourced. Now, this isn’t such a major problem under regular circumstances. But in busier seasons (like Q4 for e-commerce businesses), it may lead to deeper resource crunches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="protectyourbusinessagainstslabreaches"&gt;Protect your business against occasional SLA breaches&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First things first, you need solid monitoring in place. SLA issues often fly under the radar, especially if teams don't actively monitor status feeds or record cloud API error rates independently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So the first step to understanding whether the vendor is doing a good job is having the means for discovering SLA problems. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to have a fine-tuned monitoring and alerting process for your own components, as well as upstream dependencies of your cloud provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Here’s an example of what you can do&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use multiple “availability zone” capabilities &lt;/strong&gt;whenever they’re available and &lt;strong&gt;take advantage of cross-region backup, restore, and replication for cloud services&lt;/strong&gt; if they offer it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most cloud providers allow KMS keys to be replicated across multiple regions. The same goes for database backups. Google Cloud Platform even offers a globally replicated database called Cloud Spanner to achieve high availability across many regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you understand that there is a persistent issue happening in your cloud provider’s infrastructure, &lt;strong&gt;it’s time to make a high-availability, Disaster Recovery decision&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should you be going active-active across regions or other cloud providers? This is a fairly complex topic, and we find most customers aren’t thinking down this path yet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, when a vendor breaches an SLA, it’s good practice on their part to offer customers &lt;strong&gt;billing credits automatically&lt;/strong&gt; - without customers having to ask for them on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="switchtoanothercloudprovider"&gt;And if it’s still not working, switch to another cloud service provider &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--130NxF5R--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cast.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1080x1350.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--130NxF5R--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cast.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1080x1350.jpg" alt="how to switch cloud providers"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few best practices to make the process less painful:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="goopensource"&gt;1. Go open source&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving to true open-source standards sets you up for a smoother transition. If your team is tied into a proprietary database like DynamoDB, transitioning to another vendor will be extremely difficult. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, a few vendors provide alternative solutions without requiring any application rewrite or change. But using open source is just smarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="usecontainers"&gt;2. Use containers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take advantage of containers for application deployment. They’re lightweight and easily transportable across cloud environments. Once it’s time to say goodbye, you won’t be forced to waste time applying countless changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say that your team modernized their stack for containers. Now you need to choose a container orchestration technology. The clear winner here is Kubernetes, and each cloud provider has service offerings for Kubernetes and cloud native. If you start by adopting a proprietary solution like AWS ECS, moving to GCP or Azure will be much harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="automatedevops"&gt;3. Automate DevOps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An automated DevOps process that takes advantage of industry best practices for CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery) is a must-have. Once you set it up, releasing code - and even infrastructure - becomes very straightforward. Even if you’re using Kubernetes - there are automation solutions on the market made specifically for this container system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embrace Infrastructure as Code (IaC) as well. Your team will be able to write their infrastructure requirements and implement them using standard software techniques. Several vendors provide IaC options, the most popular one being Terraform by Hashicorp. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="findfeatureparity"&gt;4. Find feature parity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure that your new cloud provider has feature parity for your use cases. There are many functional differences between cloud providers, and some vendors have well-defined specializations. But “table stakes” are all there across the 3-4 major hyperscalers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and Oracle OCI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="getyourdataoutthesmartway"&gt;5. Get your data out the smart way&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you select your new vendor, prepare to face the next challenge: getting your data out of the original cloud provider’s servers. Moving large volumes of data can be very costly, so the operation needs some planning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t want to end up like &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/03/19/nasa_cloud_data_migration_mess/"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;, which uploaded 247 petabytes of data into AWS but forgot about the mounting egress costs. Vendors typically charge around 0.09 per GB to extract data, while important data is free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="usealoadbalancingsolution"&gt;6. Use a load balancing solution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a global load balancing solution is a smart move. It helps to make the transition between cloud providers practically seamless. Your end-users won’t even realize that a transition is taking place since the flow of traffic will switch over in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="waituntilyourcommitmentsexpire"&gt;7. Wait until your commitments expire&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure that you’re not leaving money on the table because you committed to resources via Reserved Instances or Savings Plans. Plan your transition around the expiry of such plans. Remember always to leave some time in case things go wrong and you need a quick rollback. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="havearollbackplan"&gt;8. Have a rollback plan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practice the migration rollback in pre-production first. That way, things will go much smoother during the actual transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="chooseyournewproviderwisely"&gt;9. Choose your new provider wisely&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evaluate the vendor based on their historical track record. You can also use sources like Gartner’s IaaS Magic Quadrant that evaluates major cloud providers - and reliability is part of their evaluation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check if the provider is investing in the infrastructure. Are they opening more regions? Are they handling capacity crunches by adding more capacity per region?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And always ask about billing credit policies. Can your vendor give examples of outages where they have actively refunded customers for the associated losses?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="buildadisasterrecoverystrategy"&gt;10. Build a Disaster Recovery/downtime avoidance strategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No cloud provider is flawless, but many have a strong operational foundation and proven track records at scale. Still, it’s a good idea to develop a solid Disaster Recovery and downtime avoidance strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href="https://cast.ai"&gt;CAST AI&lt;/a&gt;, we think of multiple cloud usage as an “A” AND “B” proposition. By having active-active fault tolerance across two or more cloud providers, we make sure that our customers aren’t impacted by a single cloud going down. All of this needs specialized tooling that we provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book a demo to check if CAST AI is a good fit for your team.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What I learned in freelancing as a self-taught developer.</title>
      <author>Saifullah Usmani</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 09:09:43 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/saifullahusmani/what-i-learned-in-freelancing-as-a-self-taught-developer-n2j</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/saifullahusmani/what-i-learned-in-freelancing-as-a-self-taught-developer-n2j</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi, my name is Saifullah Usmani. I am a Programmer and a Graphic Designer. I have been programming for almost 5 years now. And I have worked with several freelance clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it sounds like a thing that will add value in your life then consider following my page because I keep creating quality content for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-story"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My story:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have read my introduction. I started programming as a hobby when I was 13. I wanted to create a game and now I can make that game and also I made many but slowly my passion drifted towards web development. And right after 3 months I got my first order for $5 on fiverr. This gave me a great confidence but then it stopped. Stopped for so long that I lost interest in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-you-dont-get-order-in-freelance-market-placeslike-me-when-i-was-a-beginner"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why you don't get order in freelance market places(like me when I was a beginner):
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well the answer is pretty basic and simple. You may get frustrated or confused to hear this same reply over and over again.&lt;br&gt;
The answer is: Communication Skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-communication-skillswhat-does-it-really-mean"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why communication Skills(what does it really mean):
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not just talking or writing. It is more than that. So much more than that.&lt;br&gt;
I would say a person with strong communication skill may never die because of financial problems(hunger). That's what I believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#explanation-of-communication-skills"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Explanation of communication skills:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well let me clear up the question which kind of communication skill is needed for Freelancing.&lt;br&gt;
You must be thinking, are there other types of communication skills?. Well yes. There are a lot of areas where communication skill can come in benefit.&lt;br&gt;
But I will not talk about them in this post(Let me know if you want to learn about others.).&lt;br&gt;
So let's get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sales-communication-skillthe-skill-you-need-for-freelancing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Sales Communication Skill(The skill you need for freelancing):
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want to know the power of this skill. Let me tell you. You can get a job with this skill without even having a skill in freelancing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you may ask why would you do that? why would you take a job you cannot do. &lt;br&gt;
The simple answer is YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT YOURSELF.&lt;br&gt;
You can hire other people to do it. Be a broker and earn money by just handling management. You are now a millionaire in few years:)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well&lt;/strong&gt; this may not be the route you desire. So, you want to be a programmer and a freelancer as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-do-freelancing-as-a-programmer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to do freelancing as a programmer:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four things you must remember in freelancing on small scale:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start-ups run after latest technologies. They shift to latest tech without thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have to stay updated(I will tell you how to get out of this rat-race of learning every thing every time.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Money does matter. If you don't value money, the money will not value you. You cannot attract what you don't desire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must be good in everything(sadly yes. We will talk about it as well on how to get out of this kind of rat-race in freelancing).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You mustn't do it alone after reasonable success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-does-communication-skill-really-meanspecifically-in-freelancing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What does communication skill really mean(specifically in freelancing):
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said sales communication skill is kind here. So let's understand it much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A customer comes&lt;/em&gt; to you. He is looking for a website. He has been talking to multiple people. Some are experienced and some are not.&lt;br&gt;
He also comes to you to see if you can be a best fit for his job.&lt;br&gt;
What will you do?&lt;br&gt;
Getting confused? losing thoughts? getting panic? googling? don't know why he didn't choose you for the job?&lt;br&gt;
Well all of this is happening because you are lacking the sales communication skill.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;This skill will teach you how to react, what to say and most importantly what not to say.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you understand what is the use and benefit of sales communication skill and why you need it so let's dive deeper into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-learn-sales-communication-skill"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to learn sales communication skill:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned it from those who know it. I learned it from youtubers who are good in it.&lt;br&gt;
Even if you are learning online, learn from those who have done it. Who failed once and now is successful.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;"Dan Lok"&lt;/strong&gt; got the best playlist for it, but he is just to the point. That is not enough to be able to come up with what to say on the moment. You need to learn from other sources too. &lt;br&gt;
Learn the theory. Try to be able to come up with what to say on the moment.&lt;br&gt;
Have as much information as possible to get good at it. It takes time but it is worth it.&lt;br&gt;
You will never ever regret it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-i-didnt-provided-a-sample-message-to-send-to-clients"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why I didn't provided a sample message to send to clients?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason is I don't want to make you dependent in this independent world.&lt;br&gt;
I will not give you a fish but I will teach you how to catch one.&lt;br&gt;
I know this is not complete, let me know what should I cover next.&lt;br&gt;
Stay blessed and Happy. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cherry-Pick Your Teammate's Changes Without Push 'n Pull-ing To Your Repo In IntelliJ</title>
      <author>Andrew</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 08:53:30 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/gitlive/cherry-pick-your-teammates-changes-without-push-n-pull-ing-to-your-repo-in-intellij-2h84</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/gitlive/cherry-pick-your-teammates-changes-without-push-n-pull-ing-to-your-repo-in-intellij-2h84</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You asked your teammate for help with a piece of code and they showed you the solution in their editor. Now you need to fetch those changes. Usually, this would mean a series of tedious Git commands for both of you (not to mention that the changes will forever grace your git history), but no longer - GitLive allows you to cherry-pick your teammate's changes straight from their local files without having to push and pull to Git.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In IntelliJ, open up the team window by clicking on the GitLive icon on the bottom tool window bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GD-ZyCO3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634659779314/0zhLYUIW3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GD-ZyCO3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634659779314/0zhLYUIW3.png" alt="IJ-ultimate_2-box.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will show a list of your teammates, if they are online (or away) and the issue they are currently working on. Click the arrow on the left-hand side of the teammate that helped you to see the repositories they have cloned, locate the one they made the changes to and click the arrow beside that too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4yfTkWbn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634746697377/KkYrAS69c.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4yfTkWbn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634746697377/KkYrAS69c.png" alt="img-1-full (1).png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, you can see the list of files changed by your teammate on their branch compared to the main branch. Files with asterisks next to the file icon contain changes made locally by your teammate that have not yet been pushed to the remote repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we are only interested in their local changes, click the filter icon at the bottom of the team window to filter to only the unpushed changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7V7Sq6-C--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634746195634/r30k3K1Tp.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7V7Sq6-C--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634746195634/r30k3K1Tp.png" alt="img-2-full.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we can see the single file that contains the solution we want to copy! Clicking on it will open a diff of the changes so we can make sure it contains only the changes we need. Now all we need to do is to right click on the file and select the cherry-pick option to pick the changes. And voilà - no need for any git push- or git pull -ing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--m0gsbBxO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634746206691/EvpoAZjQZ.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--m0gsbBxO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634746206691/EvpoAZjQZ.png" alt="img-3-full.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also perform the cherry pick at the level above if you want to pick all changes from multiple files at once by right-clicking on the repository and selecting the cherry-pick option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VCpUbuma--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634746506718/eaLU9epVI.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VCpUbuma--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634746506718/eaLU9epVI.png" alt="img-4-full.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't have the GitLive extension installed yet? You can &lt;a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11955-gitlive"&gt;find GitLive here&lt;/a&gt;, and if you want to learn more, check out &lt;a href="https://blog.git.live/gitlive-8-0-Cherry-picking-your-teammates-changes"&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://docs.git.live/docs/cherrypicking/"&gt;GitLive docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Agrippa 1.2 is out 🎉🎉</title>
      <author>Nitzan Hen</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 08:42:10 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/nitzanhen/agrippa-12-is-out-13jl</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/nitzanhen/agrippa-12-is-out-13jl</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/NitzanHen/agrippa"&gt;Agrippa&lt;/a&gt; is growing steadily - it's been out for a little over two months, and already has a small community around it! 🎉🎉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're not using Agrippa yet, &lt;a href="https://github.com/NitzanHen/agrippa"&gt;get started here&lt;/a&gt;. If you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; using Agrippa, thanks for being part of the community! Let us know what you think about it, here or elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, these are the changes introduced in v1.2.0:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, the two main changes brought about in v1.2.0 are more options, this time with a focus on supporting different structural conventions that exist among React developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most notably, you can now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;export a component as a default export (instead of a named export)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;declare a component as a &lt;code&gt;function()&lt;/code&gt; declaration (instead of as a &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; with an arrow function)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create &lt;code&gt;memo()&lt;/code&gt; components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These changes came as part of a larger reform in component generation. Generation logic was remade from the ground up - instead of a large, unwieldy template, we now have proper composition patterns and a &lt;code&gt;ComponentComposer&lt;/code&gt;; internal terminology aside, this reform makes it much easier to scale, maintain and test the generation logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following this reform, we have begun the process of writing standardized tests - testing for some of the core code already exists, and the rest will be covered in the soon future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel, we got some bonus enhancements - the API docs were rewritten and are now both comprehensive and easy to read, and Agrippa will also now search for a new version when run, so that you'll always be informed when a new version is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also find this information at the release page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's pretty much it! We already have some ideas for v1.3.0 - we're currently looking into adding support for styled-components, React native &lt;code&gt;Stylesheets&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Mui 5&lt;/code&gt; styling, writing more tests and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join the community! If you haven't, try Agrippa out, and if you find a bug in Agrippa or want to suggest a new feature, please reach out here or on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your time, have a great day!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Steps to create your own Facebook Messenger chatbot</title>
      <author>Dhruv Rajkotia</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/dhruv_rajkotia/steps-to-create-your-own-facebook-messenger-chatbot-1j8g</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-a-chatbot-why-its-important"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is a Chatbot? Why it's important?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A chatbot is an artificial intelligence software that can simulate a conversation (or a chat) with a user in natural language through messaging applications, websites, mobile apps or through the telephone. It's more like a replacement of the human services to a bot which can understand the user requirement and provide assistance at any time with very low cost. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A chatbot is often described as one of the most advanced and promising expressions of interaction between humans and machines. However, from a technological point of view, a chatbot only represents the natural evolution of a Question Answering system leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP). Formulating responses to questions in natural language is one of the most typical Examples of Natural Language Processing applied in various enterprises’ end-use applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now a days we are seeing that social media platforms are becomes a crucial part in our lives and also beneficial for business perceptive. So today we are going to discuss regarding the How we can create our own Facebook messenger chatbot using Dialogflow CX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-1-create-facebook-app"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 1: Create Facebook App
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we need to create a developer app for the Facebook. &lt;br&gt;
Go to &lt;a href="https://developers.facebook.com/"&gt;https://developers.facebook.com/&lt;/a&gt; and login using your Facebook credential. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--G1hpMn9M--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bpu747dda8mfswfbwy7n.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--G1hpMn9M--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bpu747dda8mfswfbwy7n.png" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on My Apps and then you will redirect to the Developer console. Now we need to create a new app for this demo. Click on the Create App button on top right corner of the console. One you click that you can see the below screen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7-pEGFmf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qy8t7nq1u717pz7qfbku.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7-pEGFmf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qy8t7nq1u717pz7qfbku.png" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LjfVVpgm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zrs39k6lr63xaemzjfdf.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LjfVVpgm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zrs39k6lr63xaemzjfdf.png" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Provide the below details: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;App Name: (I have provided as a Claudio)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;App Purpose: (I have selected Yourself or your own business)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business Manager Account: If you have created any business account then you can use that or you can ignore this one. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on Create App button. App will be created and you will redirect to the App Dashboard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-2-create-facebook-page"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 2: Create Facebook page
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/&lt;/a&gt; and click on the Pages tab from left panel. Now click on the create New Page from left panel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3WyywBSt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gky18yf2f7yg70lznreb.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3WyywBSt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gky18yf2f7yg70lznreb.png" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Provide the page name and the category: &lt;br&gt;
Page name: Claudio ChatBot&lt;br&gt;
Category: Entertainment website (You can choose whatever you want)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on the Create Page button. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fj2-chQZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/on2okj6yo80braqig0dh.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fj2-chQZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/on2okj6yo80braqig0dh.png" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now click on the Add action button and select the Send Message Action button. Remove the pre-prompted question and click on Save.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yKJqp4vK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rliwgkfba9hq9fzh0zfp.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yKJqp4vK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rliwgkfba9hq9fzh0zfp.png" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we are all set regarding the Facebook Page setup. Now let's move on to setup Dialogflow bot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-3-create-dialogflow-cx-agent"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 3: Create Dialogflow CX Agent
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, We are going to create a Dialogflow Agent for our Facebook bot. For the demo purpose we are going to develop very simple flow in which bot will ask the Name and Phone number to user. Here you create a Dialogflow Agent based on your requirements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please download the agent blob file from here. &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AMID0_v4Qa2oUoQYYilLL5N5jT5mwGA-/view?usp=sharing"&gt;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AMID0_v4Qa2oUoQYYilLL5N5jT5mwGA-/view?usp=sharing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Import Agent file using the Dialogflow console. &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/agent?hl=en#export"&gt;https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/agent?hl=en#export&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-4-connect-dialogflow-cx-agent-with-messenger"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 4: Connect Dialogflow CX Agent with Messenger
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on the Manage tab in Dialogflow CX Console. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on the Integration option from the Menu list. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GBo6y-V7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jsrr7awthfnlcu1lg4hd.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GBo6y-V7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jsrr7awthfnlcu1lg4hd.png" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Click on the connect button for the Facebook Messenger card. You'll see the below screen as a popup. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nzyG6r-M--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hq8aizpitqxxmg470shr.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nzyG6r-M--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hq8aizpitqxxmg470shr.png" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add below details in the popup. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;App Secret: Go to the Facebook developer console and then go to Settings -&amp;gt; Basic option. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get the App secret and add the value here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Page Access Token: 
Go to Messenger -&amp;gt; Settings -&amp;gt; Access Tokens section. 
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cuYgK2QA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xgfpcgkacx6sq75x1q3q.png" alt="Image description"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on the Add or Remove Pages &lt;br&gt;
Select your page (Cloudio Chatbot) and then save changes. &lt;br&gt;
You can see the below screen after performing the above steps. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--82AnTq2d--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bzb8yw0ktsibwko6skrn.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--82AnTq2d--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bzb8yw0ktsibwko6skrn.png" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now click on the generate token and copy the page access tokens from popup. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paste page access token in you dialogflow messenger bot connect popup. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verify token: 
Add verify token as a random string which will help us in the next step for the webhook verification.(I have added as a dhruv123.) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now click on the start button so you'll see the below screen on the same popup window. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UNvZnDO1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9bwtpqfudgn0eggaxr3e.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UNvZnDO1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9bwtpqfudgn0eggaxr3e.png" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copy the Webhook URL and go to the Developer Console -&amp;gt; Messenger -&amp;gt; Settings -&amp;gt; Webhooks section. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--a8AvQtpo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ye0bakrpgtghtni2gd0q.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--a8AvQtpo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ye0bakrpgtghtni2gd0q.png" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paste Webhook URL as a Callback URL value and along with that add the verification token that we have added in the previous step. (dhruv123). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--omFQagb6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/o4zv8n57sajjvqts8edl.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--omFQagb6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/o4zv8n57sajjvqts8edl.png" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on the verify and save. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that Click on the Add Subscriptions option and checkmark messages and messaging_postbacks options. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wVbLxc6U--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pfq5kq3h032wsvdctlph.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wVbLxc6U--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pfq5kq3h032wsvdctlph.png" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JyNRVkDW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vgna69xhpa9mibm12bd7.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JyNRVkDW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vgna69xhpa9mibm12bd7.png" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it. Now your Facebook Messenger bot is up and running. Go to the messenger and search for your page (Claudio-ChatBot) and start conversation by sending hi message. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AvVEAS2f--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5lgqga6b3az0j89b1ecd.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AvVEAS2f--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5lgqga6b3az0j89b1ecd.png" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the bot will send you welcome message and conversation is started as per expectation. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Eslint configuration for Node Project</title>
      <author>Abayomi Ogunnusi</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 08:13:43 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/drsimplegraffiti/eslint-configuration-for-node-project-275l</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/drsimplegraffiti/eslint-configuration-for-node-project-275l</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We'll talk about how to enforce a style guide in our Nodejs project today in this brief post. When writing code, it's important to stick to a style and be consistent.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/l2JejvPDaGGUaeEb6/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/l2JejvPDaGGUaeEb6/giphy.gif" alt="eslint"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🥦 Let's get started by configuring our integrated environment. To begin, go to the vscode market and look for the eslint extension. This adds ESLint support to Visual Studio Code.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8mtGNj_f--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/arzh4ck3gtklxodxnazm.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8mtGNj_f--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/arzh4ck3gtklxodxnazm.PNG" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With that out of the way, make a folder and change directory: &lt;code&gt;mkdir eslint-tut&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cd eslint-tut&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open your IDE terminal and run this node package execute &lt;code&gt;npx eslint --init&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GOVpsxmi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lb6s4ep97hnbhmujbvgr.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GOVpsxmi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lb6s4ep97hnbhmujbvgr.PNG" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To select a guide, simply follow the instructions. My main goal is to have a standard guide.&lt;br&gt;
🥦 Choose to check syntax, find problems and enforce code style.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--66lSsfE0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i5xdd1r1jbejvpo4ksj3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--66lSsfE0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i5xdd1r1jbejvpo4ksj3.png" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
🥦 CommonJS (require/exports).&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--M7qjCR1q--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ix59zdlx3odqx85acea3.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--M7qjCR1q--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ix59zdlx3odqx85acea3.PNG" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
🥦 None of these&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--trJZi9hz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gikqzlvcj4e5zs7mek4h.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--trJZi9hz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gikqzlvcj4e5zs7mek4h.PNG" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
🥦 Since I am not using typescript, i choose no.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--aRrST1J7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uflgfnefuvnulj2pk6n1.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--aRrST1J7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uflgfnefuvnulj2pk6n1.PNG" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
🥦 I am running a node app,  choose node.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--85o9T0dn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u471fvcpthetwq2m02wu.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--85o9T0dn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u471fvcpthetwq2m02wu.PNG" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
🥦  I used a popular style guide.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UEQbnCk---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r0x3iarqgtwyuchx47cr.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UEQbnCk---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r0x3iarqgtwyuchx47cr.PNG" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
🥦I chose standard over Airbnb and Google. Choose the one that suits your app best.&lt;br&gt;

🥦 For my config file format, I went with JavaScript.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ovZzMfKY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bjcbe5zjksj0lki5czc0.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ovZzMfKY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bjcbe5zjksj0lki5czc0.PNG" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
🥦 Yes, i'd love to install with npm&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0FjER45o--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/e5uhqyolhltib2immite.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0FjER45o--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/e5uhqyolhltib2immite.PNG" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
🥦 When installation is complete you should have .eslintrc.js &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--i5K0_LJG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gk0dxa135rshef1vxode.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--i5K0_LJG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gk0dxa135rshef1vxode.PNG" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 🥦 Eslint config settings and rules&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JbYxigNw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ajs73jqw5a9mmxvv6rlj.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JbYxigNw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ajs73jqw5a9mmxvv6rlj.PNG" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to use eslint in your project in two different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Using a script&lt;br&gt;
2) Using vscode commands&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;npm init -y&lt;/code&gt; to initiate your project.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2nrh0Uf0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4jp1aeziupaef89lryhg.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2nrh0Uf0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4jp1aeziupaef89lryhg.PNG" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Let's write a script in our package.json file. When we run this script its formats our code. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ealCLl3P--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lh86sb9ushtwjfp49p6j.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ealCLl3P--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lh86sb9ushtwjfp49p6j.PNG" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now run the command beelow: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fVRkwcpF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zn1l4n3ey078mts3gf5f.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fVRkwcpF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zn1l4n3ey078mts3gf5f.PNG" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should fix all inconsistencies in your code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#error-fixing-using-vsccode-command"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Error Fixing using vsccode command
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--imygcJgL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xbg9hn9ytr03lcadlalw.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--imygcJgL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xbg9hn9ytr03lcadlalw.PNG" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;🥦&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;To&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fix&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;automaically&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;vscode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ctrl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;shift&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;eslint&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Eslint&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fix&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fixable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;problems&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PBFmRR9n--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/l4lhhl43tdb6xvtomqxa.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PBFmRR9n--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/l4lhhl43tdb6xvtomqxa.PNG" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Result: 🎯&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Khj0mj60--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/v1kg7y6n8w0000t1sy0s.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Khj0mj60--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/v1kg7y6n8w0000t1sy0s.PNG" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/sowg/get-started-gsap-42pi</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Learn the basics of GSAP in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-gsap"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is GSAP?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GSAP(Greensock Animation Platform) is a JavaScript library which can animate CSS properties, SVG, React, canvas, generic objects and many other things. It is 20 times faster than jQuery and solves countless browser inconsistencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#install-gsap"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Install GSAP
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways you can use GSAP. Given below is the many ways and how to do it. Here is the &lt;a href="https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Installation"&gt;GSAP Installation Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#download"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Download
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can download GSAP from the zip file &lt;a href="https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Installation#download"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. If you want help here is the &lt;a href="https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Installation#modules"&gt;GSAP Install Helper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#use-cdn"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Use CDN
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using CDNs are highly recommended because they're so widely cached and load super-fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Docs - &lt;a href="https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Installation#cdn"&gt;https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Installation#cdn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Get CDNs - &lt;a href="https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Installation#CDN"&gt;https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Installation#CDN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#npm"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  NPM
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Docs - &lt;a href="https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Installation#npm-club"&gt;https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Installation#npm-club&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Input in code - &lt;a href="https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Installation#modules"&gt;https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Installation#modules&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#github"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  GitHub
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Docs - &lt;a href="https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Installation#github"&gt;https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Installation#github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#codepen"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  CodePen
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using CodePen or GSAP has a lot of advantages, you get to use all the Club GreenSock Plugins for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Docs - &lt;a href="https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Installation#codepenContentSection"&gt;https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Installation#codepenContentSection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Template - &lt;a href="https://codepen.io/GreenSock/pen/aYYOdN"&gt;https://codepen.io/GreenSock/pen/aYYOdN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
URLs - &lt;a href="https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Installation#codepen"&gt;https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Installation#codepen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#club-greensock"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Club Greensock
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Club Greensock you pay for extra plugins, but as said in CodePen you can use all the plugins for free, but if you want to do it outside CodePen you have to get Club Greensock membership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get Membership - &lt;a href="https://greensock.com/club"&gt;https://greensock.com/club&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
See the Plugins available in Club Greensock - &lt;a href="https://greensock.com/club/#feature-list"&gt;https://greensock.com/club/#feature-list&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#code-your-first-animation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Code your first animation!
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally the coding part!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a basic example using to() tween:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;gsap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;#myID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;duration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you notice there are two things that make this animation work, there are : target and var. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The target is the object your animating, this can be a raw object, an array of objects, or selector text like &lt;code&gt;".myClass"&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;"#myID"&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The var is an object with property/value pairs that you're animating to (like &lt;code&gt;opacity:0.5&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;rotation:45&lt;/code&gt;, etc.) and other optional special properties like &lt;code&gt;duration&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;onComplete&lt;/code&gt;. You can also add CSS style raw instead of doing it in the long js way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JS:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;backgroundColor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;GSAP:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;gsap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;backgroundColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that I added the duration inside the round brackets instead of the curly ones? It can be done either ways&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a table of short codes for transform-related properties:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;GSAP&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;CSS&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;x: 100&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;transform: translateX(100px)&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;y: 100&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;transform: translateY(100px)&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;rotation: 360&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;transform: rotate(360deg)&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;rotationX: 360&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;transform: rotateX(360deg)&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;rotationY: 360&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;transform: rotateY(360deg)&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;skewX: 45&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;    transform: skewX(45deg)&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;skewY: 45&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;    transform: skewY(45deg)&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;scale: 2&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;transform: scale(2, 2)&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;scaleX: 2&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;transform: scaleX(2)&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;scaleY: 2&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;transform: scaleY(2)&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;xPercent: -50&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;transform: translateX(-50%)&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;yPercent: -50&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;transform: translateY(-50%)&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Here is my first GSAP animation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/sowg/embed/zYzgeye?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This is all there is to building a basic animation with GSAP. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make an animation with GSAP and share it with me! I will be glad to clear your doubts in the comment. &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The choice of software technology for &lt;a href="https://tkxel.com/custom-software-development-services/"&gt;Custom application development&lt;/a&gt; is a crucial decision. Many factors are dependent on this choice. For example, do you want to &lt;a href="https://avogtal.com/"&gt;hire Java developers&lt;/a&gt; or PHP developers? What is the amount of money that the budget should be? What are the requirements for supporting it? Today we will look at two popular programming languages frequently used to build backend for web applications: PHP and Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not that easy! So, today we're going to compare these two languages while highlighting their advantages and disadvantages. Let's get started!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Java&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;It's Heavy:&lt;/strong&gt; In many ways. Almost all Java web projects are more scripts than their PHP counterpart. This is one of the main reasons for which Java has large requirements for system components. We also need to be aware that Java is more suitable for projects with heavy server loads.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Frontend:&lt;/strong&gt; Unfortunately, Java isn't an excellent choice for front-end development. Especially when you want to make many small changes to your project. Contrary to PHP (where you can modify your code without other problems), You must compile your Java projects to make available all the changes that you've made.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Development Costs:&lt;/strong&gt; It depends on the particular project; however, a general trend is becoming more common - Java web development for applications is considerably more costly than PHP-based web development. Indeed, it's not as simple as that.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Junior Java programmers earn more than younger PHP programmers. If you contrast two experts of the same age and junior specialists, you won't see any differences. However, if you're trying to get the lowest cost that you can, then stay with PHP. If not, hire Java developers.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Excellent For Big Web Project:&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike PHP, Java is exceptionally well-suited to large server loads, even when Java has more stringent minimum system requirements. If you're looking to make your web project truly adaptable, you must select Oracle's Java.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Multi-Platform:&lt;/strong&gt; You can run a Java application on any device that can support JVM, the Java Virtual Machine. I.e. it's not just tablets and smartphones but also vehicles, media players, and home appliances.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Thanks to this technology, we now have IoT, which is the internet of things. You can find out more details about IoT on our blog. However, it is essential to note that PHP is excellent for development across platforms.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Java is a structured language:&lt;/strong&gt; Sure, just like PHP, you can finish any task with Java in a range of ways. However, once the job is done, everyone can comprehend the meaning behind all the code elements.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;This is essential for large web-based applications that have an extended support history and many new features. This is because Java closely resembles Agile methodology. Both methodologies and language are excellent for future project expansion.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Various IDEs:&lt;/strong&gt; (integrated developing environment) meet multiple Java requirements for application development that will significantly ease the development process. Netbeans, Android Studio (specifically made for Android applications for development), Eclipse, etc. It is important to note that Java is hugely supported by its users and its owner (Oracle).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Presently, Java is the most popular standard for significant &lt;a href="https://tkxel.com/news/enterprise-software-development-future/"&gt;web development for enterprises&lt;/a&gt;, including insurance, banking tickets, etc.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PHP&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;li&gt;In terms of flexibility, PHP is truly a beast! In PHP, you can tackle every task in a variety of ways. Thus, it appears at first to be excellent, but in the end, PHP's most significant advantage is also its biggest disadvantage.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;If you request ten different PHP programmers to accomplish an identical task, you're likely to receive ten different outcomes. In most cases, they'll be pretty different. So what's wrong with it? Let's imagine a scenario where a programmer works on a massive web-based application and then suddenly quits the project for various possible reasons.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;It is a given that you must locate a replacement for him. That's the point where problems start. It's not uncommon for PHP programming when the programmer is unable to understand the code he wrote. However, we would like someone else to comprehend the code! It's a challenge writing "correct" PHP code. PHP doesn't have any rigid guidelines.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;You must instead write down the way it's going to work. What kind of scenario are we in? The longer a programmer is working on an assignment. As a result, the more dependent the project will become (especially when discussing freelancers). It requires a significant length of time for programmers to master the PHP projects.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Low System Requirements&lt;/strong&gt; PHP projects are operating better than Java in situations of low server load. When the high load kicks into the system, Java outraces PHP by an extended distance. That's right - PHP has shallow requirements for entry which increase significantly in the event of a large server load.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;It is easy to modify&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike Java, you can modify PHP code as often as you wish. If you're looking to make many small changes to your site - PHP is the best choice.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Simple&lt;/strong&gt; PHP has one of the most basic entry levels. It might benefit the programmer, but it's generally negative for the user, mainly when working with freelancers.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Because of this entry-level low today, there is a vast number of coders available. Unfortunately, they are coders, not programmers. The people who can complete basic tasks do not even attempt to comprehend what they're doing and aren't planning on developing professionally.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;This isn't just a bunch of the words we use - we understand the subject matter. At Tkxel, we have had some clients with completely broken apps which we had to repair (though it was less expensive to fix them than develop entirely from scratch).&lt;/li&gt;




&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;A considerable amount of code ready-to-use&lt;/strong&gt; PHP has one of the most popular communities there. This is why you can find millions of code templates that are ready to use to suit various requirements.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;This is an excellent option for those who want to make an efficient prototype if you're short of time. Unfortunately, one of the reasons it's so challenging to find PHP coders. It's much more straightforward for people to "copy-paste" without even thinking.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The security level is low&lt;/strong&gt; Patching up all vulnerabilities in PHP's security is more difficult when you contrast it with Java. PHP has a lot of security holes. One of them is SQL injection.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;By using a single script, your rival could delete or download your entire database. There isn't a completely safe scripting language, but you should not choose PHP if you aren't willing to take the risk.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What should I choose to develop my website?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conclusion is straightforward. PHP is ideal for small-scale projects that need to be built ASAP. However, you must choose Java for projects that are pretty large and has growth potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can indeed build massive PHP projects; however, there are two main factors to consider an excellent software architect and a reputable development team. However, in this scenario, there are no significant cost differences in PHP or Java software development.&lt;/p&gt;
