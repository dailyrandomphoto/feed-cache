      <title>Understanding Built In Angular Directives - Part 4</title>
      <author>Anubhab Mukherjee</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 21:40:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/anubhab5/understanding-built-in-angular-directives-part-4-49ch</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;oday we will continue our journey in understanding the other built in Angular directives mainly the &lt;strong&gt;Structural Directives&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
The directives which are used to change the structure of the DOM are called &lt;u&gt;structural directives&lt;/u&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
On a high level a structural directive adds or removes element in the DOM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first directive which we will understand is the &lt;code&gt;ngIf&lt;/code&gt; directive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structural directives always starts with an asterisk &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;*ngIf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
ngIf directive is used to show or hide an element on which it is added conditionally. If the condition executes to true the element will be shown else the element will be hidden.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;A point to note&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The element is completely removed from the DOM if the condition executes to false. It will not occupy any space in the DOM.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now lets see in practice-&lt;br&gt;
Lets create a fresh component. Name it &lt;code&gt;structural-directive-demo&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
If you are not aware of what is a component or how to create and use it I would highly recommend to read through the &lt;a href="https://dev.to/anubhab5/creating-angular-component-129e"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Once the component is created our project would look like -&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1uKPp90F--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d21yt1dn3t2t8jmcv86f.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1uKPp90F--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d21yt1dn3t2t8jmcv86f.PNG" alt="Image description" width="504" height="392"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Lets open the component.ts file and write the below code-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be precise add the variable &lt;code&gt;myAge&lt;/code&gt; and assign the value &lt;code&gt;18&lt;/code&gt; to it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;export class StructuralDirectiveDemoComponent implements OnInit {

  myAge = 18;

  constructor() { }
  ngOnInit(): void { }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now open the corresponding html template file and paste in the below code-&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p *ngIf="myAge &amp;gt;= 18"&amp;gt;I am an Adult!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p *ngIf="myAge &amp;lt; 18"&amp;gt;I am a CHILD&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now lets start the application and open the browser and open localhost:4200.&lt;br&gt;
You should see an output like below -&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QqBZORTX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xtoi9ols5j94utxxih2m.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QqBZORTX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xtoi9ols5j94utxxih2m.PNG" alt="Image description" width="324" height="125"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Lets understand what is happening under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The variable &lt;code&gt;myAge&lt;/code&gt; is holding the value 18 (the model).&lt;br&gt;
In the template when we write the below code say-&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p *ngIf="myAge &amp;gt;= 18"&amp;gt;I am an Adult!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
the variable myAge points to the model or we can say it holds the value present in the model. The condition &lt;code&gt;myAge &amp;gt;= 18&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; which is assigned to the directive ngIf. Since true is assigned to the directive &lt;code&gt;ngIf&lt;/code&gt; the &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; tag is visible.&lt;br&gt;
Now lets change the &lt;code&gt;myAge&lt;/code&gt; variable value to say 17 so that the above condition is false but the second line of code &lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p *ngIf="myAge &amp;lt; 18"&amp;gt;I am a CHILD&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if you open the browser you will see that the output changes.&lt;br&gt;
The first &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; tag is not shown/ hidden while the second &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; tag is shown which was hidden when the model value was 18.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WJJ3ylHH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gt4q94dsxny477fp83gt.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WJJ3ylHH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gt4q94dsxny477fp83gt.PNG" alt="Image description" width="313" height="161"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So that's the power of ngIf directive. If you have to conditionally show/ hide some data in the template you can easily use it.&lt;br&gt;
Also to add to the above stuff you can also assign a function to the ngIf directive which returns a Boolean value. Something like below -&lt;br&gt;
In component.ts file you have a function like below -&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  checkAge() {
    if (this.myAge &amp;gt;= 18) {
      return true;
    } else {
      return false;
    }
  }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;and in html template file you can call the function inside ngIf like below -&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p *ngIf="checkAge()"&amp;gt;I am an Adult!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Any values like &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;empty string&lt;/code&gt; when assigned to &lt;code&gt;ngIf&lt;/code&gt; will result in hiding the element.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoyed the post.&lt;br&gt;
Do like comment and share the post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cheers&lt;/strong&gt;!!!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Happy Coding&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The 4 Types of Side Hustles for Software Developers</title>
      <author>Rahul Banerjee</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 21:01:32 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/rahulbanerjee99/the-4-types-of-side-hustles-for-software-developers-e8i</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/rahulbanerjee99/the-4-types-of-side-hustles-for-software-developers-e8i</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's no secret that the job market is competitive. You need to stand out from the crowd in order to get noticed and nab an interview. But what if you're struggling with where to start? What should you do? The answer lies in your side hustle!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A side hustle, or "hustle" for short, is any project or venture you take on outside of your day job (or night job) that provides supplemental income. It could be something as simple as making candles at home; it could also be a full-time business like running a bakery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hustling is the act of making money outside of your 9-5 job or business. Side hustles are usually small ventures that provide supplemental income, but they can also turn into full-time gigs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, there are many ways for software developers to make money outside of their 9-5 work environment--and these four types may just pique your interest!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1) Freelancing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any special skills or expertise, you may be able to turn them into an independent career by freelancing on sites like Upwork and Fiverr. In fact, this may be the perfect opportunity to utilize your coding skills! There are many people who need websites and apps developed, who also need graphics for logos or other marketing materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2) Teaching&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether it's tutoring kids, coaching athletes, educating adults about finance, or just being a mentor for someone who needs support--the possibilities for teaching are endless! You could even teach people how to code or work with virtual assistants to grow their businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're an expert in a particular field, people may want to pay you for your advice! Or, they might hire someone else to do it but they still want to use your expertise so they ask for referrals. It's a win-win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3) Consulting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to freelancing, but with a longer-term consulting contract. This could involve providing expertise on everything from marketing to technology to human resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This side hustle may be perfect for you if you have a knack for planning and developing strategies, but the idea of being stuck in an office all day doesn't appeal to you. Consulting can work around your schedule so it doesn't feel like another job! It just might be a good fit for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4) Creative Ventures&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're creative and have a knack for arts and crafts, you could sell your products on sites like Etsy or at craft fairs. You also have the option of selling wholesale to other retailers--or even opening up your own brick-and-mortar store! It's not unheard of for software developers to make money with creative ventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure where to start? You can learn the basics by taking online courses, attending workshops, or even reading books about whatever your craft is. But whether you're writing a book or making candles at home, it's always best to put in the effort and do something. Here are a couple of websites you could look at&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.masterclass.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;MasterClasss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.skillshare.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SkillShare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's look at each of the side hustle in detail&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Freelancing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AoJk3QnH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.realpythonproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/pexels-photo-461064.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AoJk3QnH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.realpythonproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/pexels-photo-461064.jpeg" alt="apple black coffee business coffee" width="880" height="587"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Photo by Pixabay on &lt;a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/apple-black-coffee-business-coffee-461064/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Pexels.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been freelancing for about a year so far. I have written scripts for web scraping, data manipulation, testing, automation, etc. For all my tasks I have used Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best things about being a freelancer is that you're in charge of your own schedule. You'll never have someone looking over your shoulder telling you what to do or when you should be working. Freelancing means there are no set hours--you work on your project when you want to work on it, as long as it gets done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freelancing isn't as easy as it seems, though. There's a lot that needs to go into freelancing--you need to learn how to write a proposal, what your ideal rate is, and how to market yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote more about freelancing as a programmer on Upwork and talked about my earnings in the following article&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.realpythonproject.com/how-to-start-freelancing-as-a-programmer-on-upwork/"&gt;https://www.realpythonproject.com/how-to-start-freelancing-as-a-programmer-on-upwork/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I didn't expect was the amount of rejection I would face during my first few months of freelancing...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one wants to hire you for projects either because they think you're too expensive or not experienced enough. So it takes time to build up a reputation and get people coming back asking for your services again and again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So don't get discouraged if you're not finding any gigs in the beginning. Keep trying, keep pushing, and eventually, people will recognize your name!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few freelancing jobs that software developers can do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web scraping: Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. This can be done manually or with the help of a tool. A lot of companies require access to data available online but it might be tedious to do it manually. This is where you come in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data collection: Data collection involves extracting data from various sources and organizing it into a spreadsheet or database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web/app development: Developing websites or apps is a great way to use your coding skills. You can also offer consultation services to clients who need help getting their projects off the ground.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing: Testing is an important part of the software development process. As a tester, you can find and report bugs, test new features, and provide feedback on products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to get started with freelancing is to start building a portfolio of your work. This can include coding samples, illustrations, or logos that you have created. You can also join online communities or forums where you can find freelance work. Finally, make sure to market yourself effectively and be prepared to negotiate rates with clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Platforms to find Freelance work&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Upwork&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fiverr.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Fiverr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://contra.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Contra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.about.pangea.app/" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Pangea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.topcoder.com/how-it-works/" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;TopCoder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.guru.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Guru&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.freelancer.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Freelancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Teaching&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VzaDkpWq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.realpythonproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/pexels-photo-301926.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VzaDkpWq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.realpythonproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/pexels-photo-301926.jpeg" alt="teach dice ornament on table" width="880" height="587"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Photo by Pixabay on &lt;a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/teach-dice-ornament-on-table-301926/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Pexels.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teaching is a great way for Software Developers to earn a little extra money on the side. You can teach anyone from your own house or through the internet using an app or website. One of the best ways to find teaching jobs is through online communities and forums where people are looking for mentors. You can also create marketing materials like logos, illustrations, and coding samples as your portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many options when it comes to teaching, such as teaching one-on-one, through Skype, or on software websites like &lt;a href="https://www.codementor.io/" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Code Mentor&lt;/a&gt;. Some say that teaching an adult is more difficult than children but there's no challenge that can't be overcome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never thought I would be teaching anyone stuff related to software development--and especially anyone older than myself. But here I am with a paid online student already and blogs on WordPress, Medium, and Dev. to with more than 20k monthly views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways for software developers to teach coding. One way is to create tutorials on YouTube. You can also create tutorials on sites like Udemywhich is a video-based platform. You can make videos illustrating your favorite coding languages or use them for subjects experienced with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to teach coding is by writing articles about programming. This can help people learn more about coding, and you can also share your knowledge and expertise with others. Another great way to teach coding is 1-on-1 teaching. You can work with students one-on-one and help them learn how to code. Finally, you can also tutor university students in coding. This can be a great way to help students learn more about coding, and you can also help your mentorship skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting out with teaching can be hard. To help you get started, here are some tips for teaching coding to others:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a website where you're hosting your tutorials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publish content on your won blog and cross-post on sites like Medium and &lt;a href="https://dev.to/" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dev.to &lt;/a&gt;for beginners to learn how to code. This will promote your site and you might even make some money in the process!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make videos for the articles you wrote about and post them on Youtube.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write articles about coding skills that you have gained through experience or research. Sharing knowledge with others is one of the best ways to learn!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, your content might not get a lot of views or interaction but don't give up. The hardest part of the journey is to begin the journey. Once you have an online presence, you will notice people are approaching you to teach them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Platforms to find Mentoring Opportunities&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sharpestminds.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SharpestMinds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.codementor.io/" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Code Mentor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://codingcoach.io/" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Coding Coach&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://mentorcruise.com/filter/coding/" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mentor Cruise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://exercism.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Exercism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wyzant.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Wyzant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Consulting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6w8hjA__--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.realpythonproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/pexels-photo-3760067.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6w8hjA__--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.realpythonproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/pexels-photo-3760067.jpeg" alt="crop businessman giving contract to woman to sign" width="880" height="587"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Photo by Andrea Piacquadio on &lt;a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/crop-businessman-giving-contract-to-woman-to-sign-3760067/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Pexels.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consulting for software developers can be a lucrative way to make money. In many cases, you can charge by the hour or even by the project. This gives you the flexibility to work on your own schedule and to choose the projects that you want to work on. It can also be a great way to get experience and to learn new things. The downside is that it can be hard to get enough projects to make a living, and you might feel overqualified for the ones that do come your way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I do not have any experience with consulting since most consulting tasks will require you to be a domain expert or have a good amount of experience in a specific niche. This is where most of the challenges will come in since you would be expected to deliver great results. It may take practice, trial, and error with some failed projects before you can successfully complete a project on time and on budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in starting a consulting side hustle as a software developer, then there are a few things you can do to get started. The first is to create a website or blog where you can showcase your work. This will help potential clients learn more about you and what you can offer. You can also write articles about your experience and expertise in coding. This can help you build credibility and attract potential clients. Another great way to get started is to join online communities or forums where people post projects that need to be completed. This can give you an idea of the types of projects that are available and what clients are looking for. It can also help you find potential clients who might need your services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, you can join freelancing platforms like &lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Upwork&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.freelancer.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Freelancer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.guru.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Guru&lt;/a&gt;. This is where you will find the most opportunities because more people are looking for work on these sites. However, you'll also have to compete with other developers who are trying to get your spot in the market so it's important to stand out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way for you to find work is to create projects of your own. This gives clients the opportunity to see what you can do so they can determine if they want to hire you or not. You don't have to offer your services right away, but having a portfolio with finished projects is one of the best ways to get noticed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Creative Ventures&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sxUwjhDP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.realpythonproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/pexels-photo-8369590.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sxUwjhDP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.realpythonproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/pexels-photo-8369590.jpeg" alt="assorted stickers on the table" width="880" height="587"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Photo by RODNAE Productions on &lt;a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/assorted-stickers-on-the-table-8369590/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Pexels.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your side hustle doesn't have to involve software development at all. If you are good at vector art, graphic design, or illustrating, consider selling your services. If you're talented with Adobe Photoshop, you can create custom covers for people's self-published novels. If you're good at website design with Wix or Squarespace, create a portfolio site that shows off your skills to potential employers or customers. You can also start selling cool stickers or posters targeted towards developers. These could include programming jokes and stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also many online services that can help find paid gigs for artists such as the ones listed in the Freelancers section of this article. Personally, I tried selling stuff on Etsy and it didn't work out well for me. However, I did not put in much effort and gave up after a few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing a company's social media accounts can also be a great way to earn some extra money. You could help create or manage social media campaigns, develop or design graphics, or even help write posts! If you already have a huge following on websites like Tiktok, that's a huge plus for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you found some value in this article. It doesn't matter which side hustle or platform you chose, just choose one and be patient and consistent. Let me know your experience with other side hustles. If you want some tips to get started as a software developer in 2022, check out my article below&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Optimize React Application Performance</title>
      <author>Iftakher Hossen</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 20:16:39 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/iftakher_hossen/optimize-react-application-performance-467d</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/iftakher_hossen/optimize-react-application-performance-467d</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today we will learn about Optimize React Application Performance in this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React.Js is an open-source JavaScript UI library for building user interfaces. Nowadays React is the most popular for frontend design. It’s especially used to building single-page applications. You can create large applications in React that can transform data without reloading the page. The main purpose of React is fast, scalable, and simple. Literally, React has the ability to use several clever technics to minimize costly DOM operations required to update the UI. But for some large applications, you need to optimize your React application performance. There are several ways to speed up your React applications, let’s learn about them -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Immutable Data Structures&lt;/strong&gt; - Data immutability is an inflexible way of writing code. It has many benefits such as Zero side effects, Easier to track changes, Simpler to create, test and use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Production Build&lt;/strong&gt; - If you are experiencing performance problems in React assure that you are testing with the minified production build.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dependency Optimization&lt;/strong&gt; - It means removing the methods/functions that you never used in your application. It will optimize the bundle size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Memorize React Components&lt;/strong&gt; - Use the &lt;code&gt;useMemo()&lt;/code&gt; hook to memorize/store the expensive functions result to use when the same input occurs again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Animations&lt;/strong&gt; - There are many packages/libraries for Animations. So don’t use CSS Animations instead use those libraries or packages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Avoid using Index as key&lt;/strong&gt; - Using the key as the index can show wrong data as it is being used to identify DOM elements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;React.PureComponent&lt;/strong&gt; - React.PureComponent optimizes components by reducing wasted renders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Virtualize Long List&lt;/strong&gt; - It’s a way to improve performance when rendering a long list of data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Server-Side Rendering&lt;/strong&gt; - Server-side rendered applications have a better user experience because users receive viewable content faster than client-side rendered applications. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Lazy Loading&lt;/strong&gt; - If you use numerous images in an application then you should use Lazy Loading to avoid rendering all of the images at once to improve the page load time. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Multiple Chunk Files&lt;/strong&gt; - If you split your large files into smaller files it will help the browser to catch less and reduce loading time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Reselect in Redux&lt;/strong&gt; - It’s a simple selector library for Redux, it’s used for building memorized selectors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Using a CDN&lt;/strong&gt; - CDN delivers static content more quickly and efficiently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Web Worker&lt;/strong&gt; - JavaScript is single-threaded. To prevent slowed/ blocked down, web workers run a script in background threads. We can create &amp;amp; run it parallel to the main thread without hampering the UI flow. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;useCallback()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - It’s same like &lt;code&gt;useMemo()&lt;/code&gt; but &lt;code&gt;useMemo()&lt;/code&gt; memorize the results and &lt;code&gt;useCallback()&lt;/code&gt; memorize the function declarations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to optimize a react application. You have to know the core concepts about React after optimization. Optimization without measuring is almost premature, so you should measure performance first so that you can easily figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Event notifications provide information and integrations</title>
      <author>Phil Hawksworth</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/netlify/event-notifications-provide-information-and-integrations-341n</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout December we'll be &lt;a href="https://dev.to/blog/2021/12/01/highlighting-a-different-netlify-feature-each-day-in-december/?utm_campaign=featdaily21&amp;amp;utm_source=devto&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_content=notifications"&gt;highlighting a different Netlify feature each day&lt;/a&gt;. It might just be the thing you need to unlock those creative juices, and &lt;a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/12/01/dusty-domains-your-forgotten-domains-raise-money-for-charity/?utm_campaign=featdaily21&amp;amp;utm_source=devto&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_content=notifications"&gt;dust off that domain&lt;/a&gt; you registered but never deployed! Keep an eye &lt;a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/12/01/highlighting-a-different-netlify-feature-each-day-in-december/?utm_campaign=featdaily21&amp;amp;utm_source=devto&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_content=notifications"&gt;on the blog&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/netlify"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for each feature!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is power! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing what events have taken place in your Netlify project, and being able to trigger actions based on those events, is pretty bloomin’ powerful too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netlify creates a variety of events throughout the lifecycle of your site deployments and for other services we provide for your sites, such as form submissions. Each of these events can create notifications and trigger actions elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combining tools and services using events and triggers opens up all kinds of fun possibilities for your projects!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--icUT4nLX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://docs.netlify.com/images/site-deploys-outgoing-notifications.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--icUT4nLX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://docs.netlify.com/images/site-deploys-outgoing-notifications.png" alt="Notification options" width="880" height="501"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#whats-happening"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What's happening?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/12/16/accepting-form-submissions-without-a-server/"&gt;Somebody submitted data&lt;/a&gt; to one of your forms? &lt;a href="https://docs.netlify.com/forms/notifications/?utm_campaign=featdaily21&amp;amp;utm_source=devto&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_content=notifications"&gt;We’ll let you know.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to be notified if your site has been deployed, or if a deployment has failed? &lt;a href="https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/notifications/?utm_campaign=featdaily21&amp;amp;utm_source=devto&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_content=notifications"&gt;We have notifications for that.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to know if a pull request has triggered a build? &lt;a href="https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/notifications/?utm_campaign=featdaily21&amp;amp;utm_source=devto&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_content=notifications"&gt;Yep, we can let you know that too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a list of events related to builds and deploys that we can inform you about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Deploy started&lt;/strong&gt;: Emitted when Netlify starts building your site for a new deploy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Deploy succeeded&lt;/strong&gt;: Emitted when Netlify finishes uploading a new deploy to our CDN.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Deploy failed&lt;/strong&gt;: Emitted when a deploy does not complete.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Deploy locked&lt;/strong&gt;: Emitted when the site is &lt;a href="https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/manage-deploys/?utm_campaign=featdaily21&amp;amp;utm_source=devto&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_content=notifications#locked-deploys"&gt;locked to a published deploy&lt;/a&gt;, stopping auto publishing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Deploy unlocked&lt;/strong&gt;: Emitted when deploys are unlocked, resuming auto publishing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Deploy request pending&lt;/strong&gt;: Emitted when an untrusted deploy requires approval to begin building, as specified by the site’s &lt;a href="https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/environment-variables/?utm_campaign=featdaily21&amp;amp;utm_source=devto&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_content=notifications#sensitive-variable-policy"&gt;sensitive variable policy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Deploy request accepted&lt;/strong&gt;: Emitted when an untrusted deploy request is accepted and can begin building.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Deploy request rejected&lt;/strong&gt;: Emitted when an untrusted deploy request is rejected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More event notification details can be found &lt;a href="https://docs.netlify.com/monitor-sites/notifications/?utm_campaign=featdaily21&amp;amp;utm_source=devto&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_content=notifications"&gt;in the docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#types-of-notifications"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Types of notifications
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these events can trigger notifications. And you can configure what type of notification you receive for each event. Notification types include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/notifications/?utm_campaign=featdaily21&amp;amp;utm_source=devto&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_content=notifications#outgoing-webhooks"&gt;Outgoing webhooks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/notifications/?utm_campaign=featdaily21&amp;amp;utm_source=devto&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_content=notifications#slack-notifications"&gt;Slack notifications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#frontend"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Frontend
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all: I love frontend development. It is the direct touchpoint to the user for websites / -apps. It is the first impression for the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is so much out there. It can be paralyzing. I already used a variety of frontend frameworks: React (CRA, Gatsby, NextJS), Vue, Angular, Svelte (SvelteKit). And as far as styling goes, I've tried a lot of things too: CSS (modules), SASS, CSS-in-JS, Material, Bootstrap, Bulma, Quasar, Tailwind, Chakra UI, and more. Therefore you can assume I've tried quite a lot and my choices are not the only ones I know. (Not saying that other tools don't do the job and are inferior. It also comes down to personal preference.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#svelte-sveltekit"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Svelte / SvelteKit
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog post goes into detail &lt;a href="https://blog.jannikwempe.com/why-svelte-is-different-and-awesome"&gt;Why Svelte is different - and awesome&lt;/a&gt;. I just really enjoy using Svelte. It is more concise than React and more performant. Stores and animations are also great features. There is a reason why Svelte was the &lt;a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#section-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-web-frameworks"&gt;most loved web framework in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Svelte will make a jump in popularity with the release of SvelteKit version 1.0 which is my default for every Svelte app. In addition to that, Rich Harris (the creator of Svelte) was hired by Vercel and is now working full-time on Svelte / SvelteKit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Svelte will rise and shine ✨&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/"&gt;Learn more about SvelteKit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#nextjs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  NextJS
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, I am still often using NextJS. It is great! Just like SvelteKit is my default for every Svelte project, NextJS is my default for any React project. Mostly for the same reasons: Static Site Generation (SSG), Server-Side Rendering (SSR), built-in file-based routing based, and more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ecosystem for React is way larger than the Svelte one and more people are familiar with React. Therefore NextJS is my choice for working together with other React-devs and when relying on a certain library that is not (yet) available in Svelte (can't think of any out of my head). In addition, the demand and job market for React / NextJS are much larger than for Svelte / SvelteKit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nextjs.org/"&gt;Learn more about NextJS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tailwindcss"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  TailwindCSS
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love styling with utilities based on a predefined and easily customizable theme. If you have read my post &lt;a href="https://blog.jannikwempe.com/debunking-tailwind-counterarguments"&gt;Debunking Tailwind Counterarguments&lt;/a&gt; you already know that I am a big fan. Most often I use &lt;a href="https://headlessui.dev/"&gt;Headless UI&lt;/a&gt; as an addition to get some functionality like a select or a modal. I've also bought &lt;a href="https://tailwindui.com/"&gt;Tailwind UI&lt;/a&gt; in order to move faster and also for some inspiration — and I don't regret it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just can't go back to UI libraries like Material UI or Bootstrap anymore 🤷🏼‍♂️&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://tailwindcss.com/"&gt;Learn more about TailwindCSS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#chakra-ui"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Chakra UI
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chakra UI is inspired by Tailwind. It is also based on a theme that uses very similar design tokens. The difference to TailwindCSS is that it comes with a lot of components (therefore it is framework-specific; originally created for React but also available for Vue). The components are created with accessibility in mind. Chakra UI feels like a headstart compared to Tailwind when initially getting started but it also is a little less flexible (framework-specific, peer dependencies, etc.) I love both!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://chakra-ui.com/"&gt;Learn more about Chakra UI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#backend"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Backend
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No frontend without backend (at least if you also consider static site hosting as backend). I do not only love frontend but I love backend as well — yes, I know, focusing is not one of my strengths, but I just can't go with just one of them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#vercel"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Vercel
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vercel is my go-to for hosting my projects. It just provides a great Developer Experience (DX). Luckily they are not only the creators of NextJS but now also have Rich Harris and therefore SvelteKit expertise on board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some of my projects, Vercel alone is sufficient as it also provides also server-side functions. If it is not sufficient and I just need a little more, like auth, a DB or some storage, I go with Supabase next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://vercel.com"&gt;Learn more about Vercel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#supabase"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Supabase
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supabase ("The Open SourceFirebase Alternative") is great. It has a great DX, is very easy to use while also being quite powerful, and has a generous free tier (and is also quite cheap beyond that).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supabase will be sufficient for a lot of use cases as it provides auth, a DB with a good API through their SDK and storage. If it is not sufficient, I go with AWS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://supabase.com/"&gt;Learn more about Supabase&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aws-cdk-serverless-framework"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AWS CDK / Serverless Framework
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is literally nothing you can't do with AWS. In addition, AWS skills make you very attractive on the job market (my LinkedIn inbox is pretty full since I earned the AWS Associate Developer certificate).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've used Cloudformation, SAM, CDK and the Serverless Framework so far. I can't really decide between CDK and Serverless. I like writing my infrastructure in TypeScript but I also appreciate the ease of use and plugin system of Serverless. Both of them are well suited for serverless architectures which is what I personally almost exclusively use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/"&gt;Learn more about AWS CDK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.serverless.com/"&gt;Learn more about Serverless Framework&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it. Nothing highly sophisticated. It is mostly the tech I enjoy and I think is valuable in the future. There are also other libraries I really enjoy, like &lt;a href="https://xstate.js.org/"&gt;XState&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://react-query.tanstack.com/"&gt;React Query&lt;/a&gt; (there is also &lt;a href="https://sveltequery.vercel.app/"&gt;Svelte Query&lt;/a&gt;). Just to mention a few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does your go-to stack in 2021 look like?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DEMO: Relational Data And Custom Codeless APIs (App Blueprint)</title>
      <author>Backendless</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 19:23:51 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/backendless/demo-relational-data-and-custom-codeless-apis-app-blueprint-1ipc</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/backendless/demo-relational-data-and-custom-codeless-apis-app-blueprint-1ipc</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Backendless utilizes relational data models to improve database performance and allow users to recreate real-world relationships. The Shipping and Tracking App Blueprint showcases these capabilities in action, with the help of &lt;a href="https://backendless.com/features/backendless-core/codeless#build-api-services-without-coding"&gt;custom Codeless APIs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://backendless.com/introducing-app-blueprints/"&gt;App Blueprints&lt;/a&gt; are more than just templates from which to build a specific type of application. We design all of our free App Blueprints to provide one or more key functions that a developer would want to add to their application, regardless of the app’s business use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The free Shipping and Tracking App Blueprint showcases how to present data from multiple related tables using custom APIs. The entirety of this app blueprint was built without code using &lt;a href="https://backendless.com/developers/#ui-builder"&gt;Backendless’ UI Builder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app heavily relies on relational data to connect table objects in a way that best represents the real-world. To access the data, the app utilizes several custom APIs to present this data to users and administrators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we will explore the basics of this functionality (click the link to jump to the appropriate section):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href="#data-relations"&gt;Utilizing data relations to connect a wide range of objects in different tables&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href="#codeless-apis"&gt;Building custom Codeless APIs to interact with related data tables&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href="#ui-builder"&gt;Displaying related data on the frontend using UI Builder&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Admin dashboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Shipment tracker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  User portal and shipment creator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, all App Blueprints include thorough instructions to guide you through how to make your own modifications and customizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web app, which functions identically to a website, can be purchased for free when creating a new app in Backendless Console. It features a beautiful, responsive design that will look great on any size screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nimblepunishment.backendless.app/app/index.html"&gt;Click here to view the live demo and follow along (opens in a new tab).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#utilizing-data-relations-to-connect-a-wide-range-of-objects-in-different-tables"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a id="data-relations"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Utilizing data relations to connect a wide range of objects in different tables
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://backendless.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Database-visual-schema-model.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--71Tm7J_1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://backendless.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Database-visual-schema-model.jpg" alt="Database visual schema model" width="741" height="707"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On first glance, the database of this application can appear very complex. For example, when we look at the delivery table tree, each table has at least one relation connecting it to another table in the data model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we dig down into the structure, however, we can understand the logic behind this design. Let’s break down each step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Each &lt;code&gt;Delivery&lt;/code&gt; has a &lt;code&gt;Dispatcher&lt;/code&gt; assigned and an order in the &lt;code&gt;Delivery2Order&lt;/code&gt; table.
&lt;a href="https://backendless.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Delivery-table-to-Dispatcher-and-Delivery2Order-tables.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--aTSIzTZZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://backendless.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Delivery-table-to-Dispatcher-and-Delivery2Order-tables.jpg" alt="Delivery table to Dispatcher and Delivery2Order tables" width="487" height="463"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;code&gt;Delivery2Order&lt;/code&gt; contains the &lt;code&gt;OrderShipment&lt;/code&gt; information.
&lt;a href="https://backendless.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Delivery2Order-table-to-OrderShipment-table.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cWQVDak8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://backendless.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Delivery2Order-table-to-OrderShipment-table.jpg" alt="Delivery2Order table to OrderShipment table" width="467" height="315"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;code&gt;OrderShipment&lt;/code&gt; information includes the &lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt; that created the order, the &lt;code&gt;OrderSender&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;OrderReceiver&lt;/code&gt;, and the &lt;code&gt;Rate&lt;/code&gt; paid for the shipment.
&lt;a href="https://backendless.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/OrderShipment-table-to-Users-OrderSender-OrderReceiver-and-Rate-tables.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lRIAtCvK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://backendless.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/OrderShipment-table-to-Users-OrderSender-OrderReceiver-and-Rate-tables.jpg" alt="OrderShipment table to Users, OrderSender, OrderReceiver, and Rate tables" width="550" height="521"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The &lt;code&gt;OrderSender&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;OrderReceiver&lt;/code&gt; both have a &lt;code&gt;Country&lt;/code&gt; and may have a &lt;code&gt;State&lt;/code&gt; related as well.
&lt;a href="https://backendless.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/OrderSender-table-to-State-and-Country-tables.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--06S5YiWo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://backendless.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/OrderSender-table-to-State-and-Country-tables-600x307.jpg" alt="OrderSender table to State and Country tables" width="600" height="307"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each table contains pieces of information that, when combined, form the whole of the shipment details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to ensure data integrity across all shipments, relations are used. One reason is that the admin can change information in one table – for example, updating shipping rates – and automatically update all relevant orders. Similarly, individual elements of an order cannot be modified or deleted without impacting the entire record tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, using relational data tables allows for easier indexing of data objects. This means that your database will query faster than a NOSQL-style database, such as a product like Google’s Firebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#building-custom-codeless-apis-to-interact-with-related-data-tables"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a id="codeless-apis"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Building custom Codeless APIs to interact with related data tables
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://backendless.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Custom-Codeless-APIs.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--f3wNxIx3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://backendless.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Custom-Codeless-APIs.png" alt="Custom Codeless APIs" width="880" height="506"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Shipping and Tracking app utilizes six custom API services and 24 custom functions in UI Builder. &lt;strong&gt;All of these are built without code.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The custom Codeless API services can be found by navigating to the Backend -&amp;gt; Business Logic -&amp;gt; Codeless, as pictured above. When using a custom API with Codeless, you can see all available API blocks by scrolling to the bottom (lower left-hand corner, pictured above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this app, the custom APIs and their related methods are designed to allow the developer to quickly access important data within the data model. Once built, these APIs can be easily inserted into other functions or even new APIs using automatically-generated Codeless blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#displaying-related-data-on-the-frontend-using-ui-builder"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a id="ui-builder"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Displaying related data on the frontend using UI Builder
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you understand the data model and how it is being utilized by the custom API services, you will be able to put these elements into action on the frontend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The name of the page you are viewing can be found in the URL you are on. For instance, if you are navigating through the demo of the app and want to dive deeper into a page in your Backendless Console, you can find the page name here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;https://nimblepunishment.backendless.app/app/index.html?page=adminNavRates&amp;amp;data=%7B%7D&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#admin-dashboard"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Admin dashboard
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://backendless.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Admin-dashboard-orders.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--D7_iq4L8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://backendless.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Admin-dashboard-orders.jpg" alt="Admin dashboard - orders" width="880" height="694"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The admin dashboard provides three sections: Orders, Dispatches, and Rates. Each of these sections contain functionality for the administrator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  In the &lt;strong&gt;Orders&lt;/strong&gt; section, the admin can view order details or select one or more items to schedule for delivery or pickup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  In the &lt;strong&gt;Dispatches&lt;/strong&gt; section, the admin can mark items as completed, complete with date and time delivered, or add new dispatchers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  In the &lt;strong&gt;Rates&lt;/strong&gt; section, the admin can add new rates, including origin and destination locations, and modify existing rates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://backendless.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Admin-dashboard-dispatches.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--aXy_SNEz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://backendless.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Admin-dashboard-dispatches.jpg" alt="Admin dashboard - dispatches" width="880" height="687"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By visiting the page in UI Builder, you can see the logic that is used to achieve each function. If you have additional questions about how a page or function works, feel free to ask on our &lt;a href="http://support.backendless.com"&gt;support forum&lt;/a&gt; and we’ll be happy to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#shipment-tracker"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Shipment tracker
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://backendless.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Shipment-tracker.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--M7phGo9E--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://backendless.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Shipment-tracker-1200x765.jpg" alt="Shipment tracker" width="880" height="561"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shipment tracking page (&lt;code&gt;TrackPage&lt;/code&gt;) is where all of your data is brought together to be displayed for the end user. This page shows how each shipment is compiled into a single data record and then populated on the screen using Dynamic List Behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#user-portal-and-shipment-creator"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  User portal and shipment creator
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://backendless.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/User-portal.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Gx2tJOSx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://backendless.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/User-portal-1200x467.jpg" alt="User portal" width="880" height="342"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The user portal serves two primary functions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Listing all shipments the user has made, which each link to the shipment tracker for the order&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Enabling the user to schedule a new shipment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For reference, the tracking ID for each shipment is the &lt;code&gt;objectId&lt;/code&gt; found in the &lt;code&gt;OrderShipment&lt;/code&gt; table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://backendless.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/User-shipment-creator.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--N4OdTrWY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://backendless.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/User-shipment-creator-1200x737.jpg" alt="User shipment creator" width="880" height="540"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This application does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; include payment processing. However, you can easily add payment processing to the order page using our &lt;a href="https://backendless.com/features/marketplace/stripe-integration-plugin"&gt;free Stripe plugin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#closing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Closing
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Shipping and Tracking App is a beautiful example of logistics functionality in an ordering and shipping environment. More importantly, it provides Backendless users with a template to follow for a variety of key Backendless functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this template, you can see first-hand how to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Utilize data relations to connect objects in different tables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Build custom Codeless APIs to interact with related data tables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Utilize custom functions to display related data on the frontend using UI Builder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Codeless Coding!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automation has become the ‘it’ thing in the world of business. The need for organizations to cut costs has forced them to improve internal processes to provide improved service while also conserving time. Unfortunately, it’s not always easy for teams to streamline everything internally because they often seem like complicated processes — but there are ways around this. Using &lt;a href="https://www.appsmith.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_content=internal_tools&amp;amp;utm_campaign=weeklyblog&amp;amp;utm_term=internal_tools"&gt;Appsmith&lt;/a&gt;, developing internal tools can cut costs, time and even improve your workflow by connecting services across specialized platforms with Zapier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zapier has thousands of apps and services that can meet almost all your business automation needs. Integrating Appsmith into the mix opens up a whole new dimension. In this way, you’ll have a more efficient system in which you can connect anything from, say, a MailChimp email campaign to a Google form with data from your ERP or CRM systems delivered within the app!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog, we will be looking at adding automation to &lt;a href="https://www.appsmith.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_content=internal_tools&amp;amp;utm_campaign=weeklyblog&amp;amp;utm_term=internal_tools"&gt;Appsmith&lt;/a&gt; applications using Zapier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s get started!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building Internal Tools with Appsmith&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appsmith is a powerful platform to build admin panels, dashboards, crud apps, and internal tools. It allows us to create these applications with little to no coding required. We can build apps that integrate with just about any service you can think of. Today, Appsmith has more than 15+ data source integrations; a few popular ones include Postgres, MongoDB, Google Sheets. That’s one of the best things about Appsmith — it’s completely customizable. But if you want to build apps with Appsmith, you will likely be doing some coding in JavaScript. Yes, we can use JS anywhere across the Appsmith applications to bind, transform and create actions to the data. In terms of UI, Appsmith provides more than 25 widgets with a wide range of styling options. While it’s not hard to use Appsmith to build apps, you will need to start building them to get to the next level with Appsmith.&lt;br&gt;
Now, let’s build a simple newsletter application that can help collect contacts from Appsmith and send Emails using Sendinblue via Zapier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building UI on Appsmith&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of our newsletter is to collect emails from users and to maintain campaigns on &lt;a href="https://www.appsmith.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_content=internal_tools&amp;amp;utm_campaign=weeklyblog&amp;amp;utm_term=internal_tools"&gt;Appsmith&lt;/a&gt;. Let’s get started by following the below steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new account on Appsmith (it’s free!), if you are an existing user, log in to your Appsmith account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new application by clicking on the Create New button under the Appsmith dashboard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’ll now see a new Appsmith app with an empty canvas and a sidebar with two directories: Datasources and Widgets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on the + icon next to the widgets section and drag and drop a container widget onto the canvas. Next, bring in a form widget inside the container and two input widgets inside the form. We can configure widgets and their properties by clicking on the cog icon on the top right. This will open a property pane where we can update all the widgets settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now set the form labels to name and email.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, you can add a text widget to add aesthetics to our application; the following is how the UI looks like:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3u8EnGn0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wnjv7h3mvrxmn85ooz22.jpeg" alt="Appsmith" width="700" height="394"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excellent, our UI is now ready; let’s create a new Zapier workflow to connect to SendInBlue and manage our newsletter.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set Up Zapier with Appsmith&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excellent, our UI is now ready; let’s create a new Zapier workflow that can connect to SendInBlue and manage our newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, create a free account on Zapier and select create custom workflow option from the dashboard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Zapier, every action on the workflow is named on Zap; to establish a connection between Zapier and Appsmith, let’s create a Webhook.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Webhooks are essentially a way to create a communication channel. It allows you to listen to an event and run a command or take any action you want. Here, the event will be triggered by an API call from Appsmith.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now open the Appsmith app, click on the + icon next to the Datasource section from the sidebar, and choose Create New API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy the webhook URL from Zapier and set the request type to POST. For ease, let’s also rename the query to addContact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here, we also need to send the data from the Form widget we had created earlier; now, let’s use their names to collect data and pass them in the Webhook.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigate to the Body tab on the API and paste the following
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
"name":"{{Input1.text}}",
"email":"{{Input2.text}}"
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This code snippet will send the information from the Input widgets to Appsmith.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lastly, set the button onClick property to execute a query and set it to addContact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, on Zapier, hit the test button and send a request by filling the form on Appsmith and hitting the API. We should see the successful response on Zapier.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HQ8UXSaN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q5ud0hybqj4qq0vxhpsp.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HQ8UXSaN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q5ud0hybqj4qq0vxhpsp.jpeg" alt="Appsmith" width="700" height="310"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, click on the + icon beneath the zap to add a new workflow. Select the SendInBlue Zap from the list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will need to authenticate with SendInBlue from Zapier to access the workflow; for this, you can either create a new account or log in with your existing credentials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, set the Action type to Add or Update in Sendinblue and fill in the details related to Email; here, we can also use the data sent from the Webhook. In the following screenshot, we select the Email field data to be the email received from the webhook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SsyBjD4T--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3jwps3ytzc4wew5md6h4.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SsyBjD4T--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3jwps3ytzc4wew5md6h4.jpeg" alt="Appsmith" width="700" height="307"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similarly, you can add a Send Transactional Email in Sendinblue action to the workflow using the Seninblue Zap.
With this, whenever a new user subscribes to the Newsletter, he receives a confirmation Email and will be added to the contact list on Sendinblue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just like that, we could configure and build an entire Newsletter manager without writing code. This application can be extended in multiple ways, such as creating new email campaigns, filtering contacts, blocking users, and many more! The entire demo app of this tutorial can be found here. This is just one example of how you can automate your apps on &lt;a href="https://www.appsmith.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_content=internal_tools&amp;amp;utm_campaign=weeklyblog&amp;amp;utm_term=internal_tools"&gt;Appsmith&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope that you will have a better idea of how to leverage automation in your Appsmith applications. For more information on automating your Appsmith applications, please contact me anytime at &lt;a href="mailto:vihar@appsmith.com"&gt;vihar@appsmith.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>To Pair or Not to Pair: Introduction</title>
      <author>ulimi-creator</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 18:57:54 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/ulimicreator/to-pair-or-not-to-pair-introduction-1n9</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/ulimicreator/to-pair-or-not-to-pair-introduction-1n9</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pair programming&lt;/strong&gt;, aka &lt;strong&gt;pairing&lt;/strong&gt;, is more than what  you're probably thinking it is even if you have a good grasp on the words &lt;em&gt;pair&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;programming&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
When we have two people working together on the same computer... on the same code, we have a setup for pair programming. Due to reasons, these individuals might find themselves at different locations, when this is so, it is a popular move to use video conferencing tools to accomplish this process.&lt;br&gt;
Now, just putting two people together, in front of a machine displaying some code is not pair programming. With pair programming, you find a situation where two people constantly communicate with each other about the code, find each other's errors and try to bring out the best possible code to write that accomplishes their sought after goal. &lt;strong&gt;These programmers are expected to work as a team.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So things might seem weird at this point, like how does a person actually share a machine with you?&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-does-this-actually-work-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How does this actually work ?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two roles, one for each person, obviously. We have &lt;strong&gt;the navigator&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;the driver&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does the driver do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Just like how a driver interacts with a car, the driver in this case works directly with the machine to actually type in the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does the navigator do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The navigator exists to give pointers, answer questions from the driver, ask their own questions about the code being written, and intensively read the code as it is typed so that mistakes are noted fast. With a navigator, the driver not only has a pair of eyes on the code, but also another brain on it.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Both continuously communicate about the project and the best way to do it. The driver can explain -out loud- what is being  typed, and the navigator can keep track of what has been done and what is suppose to come next.&lt;br&gt;
There is no designated person for a role, and participants can and should switch roles as many times as they deem fit so that both programmers can learn from each other.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Some more common pairings might involve:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A junior programmer and a senior programmer, to allow an easier onboarding process by letting a person more familiar with the code base to serve as a navigator.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Developers of the same rank so that they can properly learn from each other. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Like every practice, pair programming can be adjusted to fit the company's workflow.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn more with my upcoming post &lt;code&gt;To Pair or Not to Pair: Benefits&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  Amazon Personalize new features
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--I7Ll8P8j--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7vvuxg95fg5w1vt6pe25.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--I7Ll8P8j--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7vvuxg95fg5w1vt6pe25.png" alt="Image description" width="770" height="308"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User segmentation and use case optimized recommenders&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ar/about-aws/whats-new/2021/11/amazon-personalize-intelligent-user-segmentation/"&gt;User segmentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon Personalize now offers intelligent user segmentation so you can run more effective prospecting campaigns through your marketing channels. By using two new recipes, you can automatically segment your users based on their interest in different product categories, brands, and more. aws-item-affinity identifies users based on their interest in individual&lt;br&gt;
items, such as movies, songs, or products. aws-item-attribute identifies users based on the attributes they care about, such as genre or price point.&lt;br&gt;
This drives higher engagement with marketing campaigns, increases retention through targeted messaging, and improves the return on investment for your marketing spend. &lt;br&gt;
For sample cost calculations, see &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/personalize/pricing/"&gt;Amazon Personalize pricing.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ar/about-aws/whats-new/2021/11/recommenders-optimized-personalized-media-entertainment-retail-amazon-personalize/"&gt;Use case optimized recommenders for retail, as well as media and entertainment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New recommenders make it faster and easier to deliver high-performing personalized user experiences. You can choose from use cases like “Frequently Bought Together,” “Because You Watched X,” “Top Picks for You,” and more. Map your data to a recommender, and Amazon Personalize chooses the optimal settings for your use case and automates the work of creating and maintaining personalized recommendations. For sample cost calculations, see &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/personalize/pricing/"&gt;Amazon Personalize pricing.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Availability&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General availability. For more information, check the &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/"&gt;AWS Regional Services&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;br&gt;

  Amazon Kendra new capabilities
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XKhpl--4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/z3yngvyopxle3ivk2mpe.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XKhpl--4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/z3yngvyopxle3ivk2mpe.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="364"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experience Builder, Search Analytics Dashboard, Custom Document&lt;br&gt;
Enrichment&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What is it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experience Builder&lt;br&gt;
You can now deploy a fully functional and customizable search experience with Amazon Kendra in a few clicks, without any coding or machine&lt;br&gt;
learning (ML) experience. Experience Builder delivers an intuitive visual workflow to quickly build, customize, and launch your Amazon Kendra– powered search application securely on the cloud. You can start with the ready-to-use search experience template in the builder, which can be customized by simply dragging and dropping the components you want,&lt;br&gt;
such as filters or sorting. You can invite others to collaborate or test your search application for feedback, and then share the project with all users when you’re ready to deploy the experience. Amazon Kendra Experience Builder comes with AWS Single Sign On (SSO) integration that supports popular identity providers such as Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AD) and Okta ,delivering secure end-user SSO authentication while accessing the search experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Search Analytics Dashboard&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Amazon Kendra Search Analytics Dashboard allows you to better understand quality and usability metrics across your Amazon Kendra–powered search applications. The Search Analytics Dashboard helps administrators and content creators understand how easily end users are finding relevant search results, the quality of the search results, and gaps in&lt;br&gt;
the content. The dashboard provides a snapshot of how your users interact with your search application and how effective your search results are. The analytics data can be viewed in a visual dashboard in the console, or you can build your own dashboards by accessing the Search Analytics data through an API.&lt;br&gt;
The dashboard empowers you to dive deep into search&lt;br&gt;
trends and user behavior to identify insights, as well as bring clarity to potential areas of improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Custom Document Enrichment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Amazon Kendra Custom Document Enrichment capabilities, you can build a custom ingestion pipeline that pre-processes documents before they get indexed into Amazon Kendra. For example, while ingesting content from a repository like SharePoint using AWS connectors, you can enrich documents with additional metadata, convert scanned documents to text, classify documents, extract entities, and further transform the document using custom extract, transform, and load (ETL) processes. The enrichment&lt;br&gt;
is performed by simple rules that can be configured in the console or by invoking functions from AWS Lambda. These functions can optionally call other AWS artificial intelligence (AI) services such as Amazon Comprehend, Amazon Transcribe, or Amazon Textract.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Resources&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

  Amazon Lex Automated Chatbot Designer (Preview)
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nXdctkMJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/31eyy99kn87tyfxukn90.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nXdctkMJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/31eyy99kn87tyfxukn90.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="404"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accelerate conversation design&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What is it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Amazon Lex Automated Chatbot Designer helps you design chatbots using existing conversation transcripts in hours rather than weeks. Using machine learning (ML), it can analyze thousands of lines of transcripts in a couple of hours and provide an initial bot design that includes common intents and the information needed to fulfill them. You can iterate on the bot design to deliver effective conversational experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designing conversational interfaces or chatbots is manual, time consuming, and prone to human errors. Developers often spend hundreds of hours analyzing transcripts and gathering the key information needed to design chatbots. With the Automated Chatbot Designer, you can off-load the analysis of conversation transcripts to Amazon Lex and accelerate the design of your chatbots, reduce errors, and improve your customer experience.&lt;br&gt;
You can try the Automated Chatbot Designer in Preview for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
• Reduce manual effort. Analyze thousands of lines of transcripts to discover intents and compile a list of information required to fulfill them, reducing&lt;br&gt;
manual effort in conversation design.&lt;br&gt;
• Expedite conversation design. Automatically surface an initial bot design that you can then refine to launch conversational experiences faster.&lt;br&gt;
• Improve customer experience. Help your bot understand customers better by minimizing ambiguity between intents. Ensure that intents are well defined&lt;br&gt;
and well separated to avoid frustration and improve customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Availability&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
Amazon Lex is available in 12 AWS Regions. For more information, check the &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/"&gt;AWS Regional Services&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;br&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  JWT
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;JWT stands for JSON Web Token. It is used to share security information between the client and server-side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JWT is used just for authorization. Authorization is mainly what makes sure that the user which sends a request to the server is the same person who logged in. It means it is authorized if the user has access to the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JWT uses a web token for this authorization. It works like this- &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It executes the authentication process. Then the server creates a JSON web token, which we know stands for JWT, and creates a secret key so the server can check with that if the user is invalid based on that secret key. And then it takes the web token and sends it to the browser and it will send a request to the server with the JWT token. It verifies it so that it can check if the secret key and user information are the same as before to know it is valid or invalid. And if the user is valid, it sends the response back to the server. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a good sense of curiosity in the reader in email marketing
The most important factor in opening an email is the curiosity of the audience. Curiosity is a very effective way and encourages the reader to click on the email. Using this method in the title of the email is very effective and increases the rate of opening the email.
For more impact, state the title and the first line in a way that makes the reader curious and makes them feel good. This will allow the user and the client to open your email.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Email subject&lt;br&gt;
Do not use titles such as "hello" and short words to increase email opening rate in email marketing. Also avoid aimless and short titles. The title of your email is very important and will attract the attention of the audience&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focus on the first line&lt;br&gt;
The best way for your email to be read by the user is how to write the first line of the email. Write the first line of your email very carefully and leave it for that time because it has a very important impact on the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use of numbers&lt;br&gt;
Using special numbers will increase the opening rate of your emails in email marketing. For example, write down the duration of a movie that you emailed for advertising. Know that using specific numbers increases the audience's curiosity.&lt;br&gt;
For example:&lt;br&gt;
• 10 ways to earn professional internet money&lt;br&gt;
• You only have until 20:30.&lt;br&gt;
• Download 6:30 minute movie&lt;br&gt;
• and…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use question sentences&lt;br&gt;
Using question sentences when sending an email to the user increases the rate of email opening, such as:&lt;br&gt;
• How to increase sales?&lt;br&gt;
Haven't seen the free movie yet?&lt;br&gt;
Why not start your own Internet business?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify user interests and audience segmentation for email marketing
If we send an email to all our contacts, if someone does not like or need the content of our email, they will not open it. Or he may be upset and change his view of our brand.
When it comes to email marketing campaigns, it's best to divide your audience into several categories. Send emails to each category based on their interests and needs. Not only does this make them more willing, but it can also increase the click-through rate of the email sent. Having a call-to-action bar in the email will increase the number of customers coming to our website .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, suppose you are very interested in pizza, if every week, a 60% discount is sent to your Inbox by your favorite pizza shop, would you not want to open the whole email ?! The answer to this question will definitely be positive.&lt;br&gt;
One of the most effective tricks to increase clickthrough rate is to monitor the interests of each of your users. This method is very simple. You will definitely receive an email or phone number from your buyers.&lt;br&gt;
Track what products and services users provide, and organize and categorize people who are interested in a particular category of your products.&lt;br&gt;
You can then design an email text for each user according to their taste and interest. Or just send emails and suggestions that the person is more interested in receiving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customize your emails
Try to be intimate with your audience in the content of email marketing, so that the person feels that this email is designed just for him and after receiving the email, he will feel good. This creates a sense of worth in the person.
Suppose you receive an email from a reputable company with the subject line:
"Mohammad Jan, you have not yet received your 50% discount code ?!"
The person becomes curious to open the email, then reads the contents of the email. It feels valuable to be targeted by a reputable brand and company. This is etched in the recipient's mind and increases the likelihood of the email being reopened.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion&lt;br&gt;
According to the golden and practical tips of email marketing mentioned above, you can have successful email marketing campaigns. As a result, you will have the highest return with the least cost. Email marketing is one of the most powerful digital marketing tools that plays a role today. It is important in increasing sales and attracting specific audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
