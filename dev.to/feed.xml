      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#hello"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Hello 👋
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I will show you how to make Random Background, when you click a button in JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is Part 1 of the 50 JS Project Challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let's get into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, here is the video tutorial:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EFRKtivo7zw"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#so-lets-start-coding"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  So let's start coding.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we need to create three files:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;index.html&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;style.css&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;home.js&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we have those files created, we can start coding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the code for index.html:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;html lang="en"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Document&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class="wrapper"&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;h1 class="number"&amp;gt;0&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;div class="buttons"&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;button class="upper" onclick="add()"&amp;gt;Add Count&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;button class="lower" onclick="Lower()"&amp;gt;Lower Count&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;script src="home.js"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So basically we are creating one Text for the counter and two buttons. Nothing crazy so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it's time for styling!. Open our style.css and write this code in it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:ital,wght@0,100;0,200;0,300;0,400;0,500;0,600;0,700;0,800;0,900;1,100;1,200;1,300;1,400;1,500;1,600;1,700;1,800;1,900&amp;amp;display=swap');

*{
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;
}
.wrapper{
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    padding-top: 35vh;
}
h1{
    font-size: 4rem;
}
.buttons{
    padding-left: 1.5rem;
}
button{
    margin-left: 0.5rem;
    background-color: #4287f5;
    color: white;
    padding: 12px 7.5px;
    border-radius: 20px;
    border: none;
    outline: none;
    cursor: pointer;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We have a font here declared, the font is Poopins.&lt;br&gt;
We are rewriting the default padding and margin and changing the font to Poopins. The other is just styling elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let's move to the JavaScript part. Here is the code for JavaScript.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const upper = document.querySelector(".upper");
const lower = document.querySelector(".lower");
const numberElement = document.querySelector(".number")
let number = 0;


function add(){
    number += 1;
    numberElement.innerHTML = number;
}

function Lower(){
    number -= 1;
    numberElement.innerHTML = number;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So first we are creating variables for each element in HTML. The we are creating a variable for Number Integer so we can count how many users press the button. So we are creating two functions, one for increasing our counter, and one for decreasing.&lt;br&gt;
Function obtains a Number + or -, and then we are passing the value to the actual text. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JiaAYoEs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/44hf1uc7yro94huebkhn.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JiaAYoEs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/44hf1uc7yro94huebkhn.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="477"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that's it. You can see the Actual value of the number on the screen, depending which button you are pressing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading my post, and I hope I will see you next time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JSON Web Token</title>
      <author>Abu Rahan</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 11:44:35 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/raihan6714/json-web-token-1aka</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/raihan6714/json-web-token-1aka</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is a JSON Web Token?&lt;br&gt;
JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although JWTs can be encrypted to also provide secrecy between parties, we will focus on signed tokens. Signed tokens can verify the integrity of the claims contained within it, while encrypted tokens hide those claims from other parties. When tokens are signed using public/private key pairs, the signature also certifies that only the party holding the private key is the one that signed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When should you use JSON Web Tokens?&lt;br&gt;
Here are some scenarios where JSON Web Tokens are useful:&lt;br&gt;
Authorization: This is the most common scenario for using JWT. Once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token. Single Sign On is a feature that widely uses JWT nowadays, because of its small overhead and its ability to be easily used across different domains.&lt;br&gt;
Information Exchange: JSON Web Tokens are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties. Because JWTs can be signed—for example, using public/private key pairs—you can be sure the senders are who they say they are. Additionally, as the signature is calculated using the header and the payload, you can also verify that the content hasn't been tampered with.&lt;br&gt;
What is the JSON Web Token structure?&lt;br&gt;
In its compact form, JSON Web Tokens consist of three parts separated by dots (.), which are:&lt;br&gt;
Header&lt;br&gt;
Payload&lt;br&gt;
Signature&lt;br&gt;
Therefore, a JWT typically looks like the following.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's break down the different parts.&lt;br&gt;
Header&lt;br&gt;
The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.&lt;br&gt;
For example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, this JSON is Base64Url encoded to form the first part of the JWT.&lt;br&gt;
Payload&lt;br&gt;
The second part of the token is the payload, which contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. There are three types of claims: registered, public, and private claims.&lt;br&gt;
Registered claims: These are a set of predefined claims which are not mandatory but recommended, to provide a set of useful, interoperable claims. Some of them are: iss (issuer), exp (expiration time), sub (subject), aud (audience), and others.&lt;br&gt;
Public claims: These can be defined at will by those using JWTs. But to avoid collisions they should be defined in the IANA JSON Web Token Registry or be defined as a URI that contains a collision resistant namespace.&lt;br&gt;
Private claims: These are the custom claims created to share information between parties that agree on using them and are neither registered or public claims.&lt;br&gt;
An example payload could be:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "admin": true
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The payload is then Base64Url encoded to form the second part of the JSON Web Token.&lt;br&gt;
Signature&lt;br&gt;
To create the signature part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that.&lt;br&gt;
For example if you want to use the HMAC SHA256 algorithm, the signature will be created in the following way:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
  base64UrlEncode(payload),
  secret)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The signature is used to verify the message wasn't changed along the way, and, in the case of tokens signed with a private key, it can also verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is.&lt;br&gt;
Putting all together&lt;br&gt;
The output is three Base64-URL strings separated by dots that can be easily passed in HTML and HTTP environments, while being more compact when compared to XML-based standards such as SAML.&lt;br&gt;
How do JSON Web Tokens work?&lt;br&gt;
In authentication, when the user successfully logs in using their credentials, a JSON Web Token will be returned. Since tokens are credentials, great care must be taken to prevent security issues. In general, you should not keep tokens longer than required.&lt;br&gt;
You also should not store sensitive session data in browser storage due to lack of security.&lt;br&gt;
Whenever the user wants to access a protected route or resource, the user agent should send the JWT, typically in the Authorization header using the Bearer schema. The content of the header should look like the following:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Authorization: Bearer &amp;lt;token&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This can be, in certain cases, a stateless authorization mechanism. The server's protected routes will check for a valid JWT in the Authorization header, and if it's present, the user will be allowed to access protected resources. If the JWT contains the necessary data, the need to query the database for certain operations may be reduced, though this may not always be the case.&lt;br&gt;
If the token is sent in the Authorization header, Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) won't be an issue as it doesn't use cookies.&lt;br&gt;
The application or client requests authorization to the authorization server. This is performed through one of the different authorization flows. For example, a typical OpenID Connect compliant web application will go through the /oauth/authorize endpoint using the authorization code flow.&lt;br&gt;
When the authorization is granted, the authorization server returns an access token to the application.&lt;br&gt;
The application uses the access token to access a protected resource (like an API).&lt;br&gt;
Do note that with signed tokens, all the information contained within the token is exposed to users or other parties, even though they are unable to change it. This means you should not put secret information within the token.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Python vs Java: Which is Best Language for 2022</title>
      <author>clouddevloper</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 11:43:47 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/clouddevloper/python-vs-java-which-is-best-language-for-2022-1odj</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/clouddevloper/python-vs-java-which-is-best-language-for-2022-1odj</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Are you unsure of what programming language you should learn? If you are planning to begin writing code in 2022, you have only one option. Who will win in the Python against. Java battle?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The year of the pig is approaching, which makes it even more crucial to look at the new possibilities within the technical range. Also why not kick off 2022 by studying a new language completely? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there are a lot of choices available on the market, there's an ongoing struggle among Python and Java that keeps students in the know. For more details on what each of the programming languages have to offer check &lt;a href="https://www.edureka.co/java-j2ee-training-course"&gt;Java course&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://www.edureka.co/python-programming-certification-training"&gt;Python course&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From creating games, running apps and writing complex codes What is the one you believe will rise to the top of the list in 2022?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's take a look at factors that measure level of competition among the top competitors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python against. Java: The Competition Starts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make this comparison, take into consideration these suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#python-is-vs-java-learning-the-nuances"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Python is vs. Java: Learning the Nuances
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python is easy to learn and what you see is the result you receive when you start learning it. The syntax is straightforward and terminal windows are simple to navigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This language with many different aspects continues to attract newcomers, particularly people who are new to programming and want to begin by learning a simple language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its extensive, well-funded assistance from the community, Java was designed to be used by advanced users with many years of experience in programming. It's simple to say that the language could have plenty numbers of customers, yet it's not going to make sense for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#python-vs-java-interpreting-the-codes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Python Vs. Java: Interpreting the Codes
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each language continues to garner interest due to their many applications. Each programming language is evaluated according to its syntax which makes it an extremely efficient and easy to learn language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python remains to provide a variety of concise syntax options, despite numerous updates. This means that coding as well as testing applications are easy. Input lines directly into the terminal window and experience an enjoyable, seamless and effective procedure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#python-and-java-interpreting-the-codes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Python and. Java: Interpreting the Codes
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two languages are continuing to draw attentiondue to their diverse applications. Every programming language is graded by its syntax, making it an extremely efficient and simple language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python remains to provide a variety of straightforward syntax options, despite numerous updates. This means that coding or testing software is easy. You can type in lines directly in the terminal window and experience an effortless, smooth and effective procedure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#python-and-java-navigating-through-game-development"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Python and. Java: Navigating Through Game Development
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python is not a popular competitors that use it to develop games. Gaming is all about speedy processing, speed-validation, and simple-to-optimize hardware. However, Python offers none of these features, making it a far cry from its rival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python can get around these delays through wrappers and bindings with third-party libraries. But this is a tough method of getting gaming speed but it won't be easy to use in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Java wins the competition by offering multi-threading. This is in contrast to Python which comes with an interpreter lock that is global (the language can only use one CPU unit at a given time because of limitations).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Java's sockets are helpful in creating multiplayer games, and also for the development of Android games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside Java, JMonkeyEngine and OpenGL continue to be the most popular open-source gaming engines. However they're not able to compete with other languages that are faster, such as C/C++.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python Vs. Java: Gauging Popularity&lt;br&gt;
The demand for Python has risen after the pandemic and there's no way to stop the most popular language of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to PYPL, Python has earmarked its place within five nations (France, UK, India, Germany, and US). The open source language is dominant in its share of the UK market, and has 34% market share, according to StatisticsTimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java is second only to Python in terms of popularity. There is a tiny market share that is still held by the language, but it is declining rapidly due to the appearance of other alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The versatility of Java and its development options has helped it keep an enviable position among the Stack Overflow's most loved programming languages, but this could change in the next few years. Despite its declining popularity it's still a great language for 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python Vs. Java: Bracing Web Frameworks for Development&lt;br&gt;
The web development frameworks for Python include Django and Flask that provide the basics of functionality without many routing requests or excessive cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally the Java's Spring is among the most popular backend frameworks used in web-based development of applications. The Java development ecosystem is extensive and comes equipped with community support, which makes the process of development simpler and easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, the battle in between Java as well as Python is a battle to the death because both languages provide the same options. This opens the door to excellent web application development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#python-vs-java-data-science-usability"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Python Vs. Java: Data Science Usability
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the field of data science, there's plenty of languages that can be used. When comparing Python and Java both, the former tends to win. Java is an excellent data science languagesince it is able to support Big Data. However, Python continues to be the most popular language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Java is built to support Web development as well as programming and not data science. If you were to carry out certain calculations in both languages, you'd recognize that Python will be the master of all trades in the long term, due to the pre-built libraries that are standardised, standardized syntaxes and a user-friendly platform interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#python-or-java-which-is-the-winner"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Python or Java Which is the winner?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you consider all the factors that rank above, it is an obvious fact it is Python is the preferred language of this year. If you're looking to dive deeper into a custom simple language that is able to yield excellent returns choose Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The language's versatility, its customizable options, and simple syntax will make it an ideal addition to your existing set of programming abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Docker Hot Tips</title>
      <author>Yur-ii</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 11:42:56 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/falselight/docker-tips-5fll</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;These tips will be useful for developers who are already familiar with docker and understand the fundamental principle behind it. In my opinion, these are the hottest tricks for the newcomer who for some reason has not yet memorized these commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLC - Peace! Love! Code!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#docker-build-container"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Docker build container
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker build ./ -t "&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;" --platform=linux/amd64
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ssh-into-a-container"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  SSH into a container
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker exec -it &amp;lt;mycontainer&amp;gt; bash
# or
docker exec -it &amp;lt;mycontainer&amp;gt; sh
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#remove-all-containers-amp-all-images"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Remove: all containers &amp;amp; all images
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;# List all containers (only IDs)
docker ps -aq

# Stop all running containers
docker stop $(docker ps -aq)

# Remove all containers
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)

# Remove all images
docker rmi $(docker images -q)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;






&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dockercompose-build"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  docker-compose build
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;# --build-arg ENV_VAR=&amp;lt;value&amp;gt; - add args
docker-compose --project-name "&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;" build \
--build-arg ENV_VAR=&amp;lt;value&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dockercompose-up"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  docker-compose up
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

      <title>Why is your employer keen on keeping strangers out?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you saw Santa in your office you will know that he does not work there, did you challenge him, his ID and purpose for being there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scary truth is that some 75%+ cyber attacks start with an altogether more human act of social engineering. The act of hacking people by manipulation IRL, phishing etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A rule following employee who follows everything without question is going to leave a door open if there is a note signed by the manager, they are an easy target.&lt;br&gt;
Even simple things your publicly available benefits plan can be used to exploit and gain access: An MOT (car repair) service plan in the car park, could get a thief through the gates, and you would not bat an eye. Thats one step closer to  key-logger in the back of a USB port, then, you're toast. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway Happy Christmas &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>End to end Debug Object Modeling. First hard problem in Building DDTJ - Day 4</title>
      <author>Shai Almog</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 11:20:09 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/codenameone/end-to-end-debug-object-modeling-first-hard-problem-in-building-ddtj-day-4-179h</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/codenameone/end-to-end-debug-object-modeling-first-hard-problem-in-building-ddtj-day-4-179h</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I got the &lt;a href="https://dev.to/codenameone/code-coverage-java-debugger-api-and-full-integration-in-building-ddjt-day-3-1i20"&gt;second PR out of the door&lt;/a&gt; (and the 3rd although that was automated). Today wasn't as productive...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winter just started in full force around these parts, and yesterday, everything was flooded. This slowed down some of my work, especially after my son's kindergarten was flooded and he had to stay home. Still, I could make progress thanks to the fact that the code now runs end to end. That means I can start debugging the whole thing by using the command line and setting a breakpoint in the backend. Very convenient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can now finally start collecting data. I've also run into my first “hard” problem that I’ve been avoiding mentally for a while…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-problem"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Problem
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debugging the app is mostly trivial. Let’s say we invoke a method and get an event. Specifically, a MethodEntryEvent. In that event, we can grab the values of the arguments, etc. This is also the case later on when we invoke the APIs we need to mock. But that’s for later… Right now, let’s focus on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The debugger returns a somewhat problematic value type. We’ll need to pull all of that data locally (the debugger is a remote VM) to debug that. The core problem is with a deep object graph. E.g. let’s say I have a method such as:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;method&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Root&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now Root contains a reference to every object in the system. If we want to invoke this method correctly in a future execution, do we need to pull Root and all its data? &lt;br&gt;
That’s insane. There has to be a better way...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s the smaller problem. Let’s say we have an object's data locally. How do we physically create an instance with the right values to pass to a method?&lt;br&gt;
Do we use a constructor? A builder? Or is it all 100% mocked?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it’s the latter, will the code be readable? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will the test we generate pass?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had given this a lot more thought in the past day, and I’m a bit conflicted here. An approach I sometimes take in these cases is to see these things all the way through, then refine the result to something I like. Sometimes the solutions reveal themselves as we get closer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few ideas I had to solve the problem...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-insane-idea"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The “Insane” Idea
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One idea I had is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watch every object creation and log that&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a new type of object is created or it’s created in a new way, we can connect the creation process to the fields&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the constructor is public, we can use that &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it’s a builder, we can follow the process from there&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I write this, the idea seems even crazier than it sounds in my head, but it might be doable. At least partially. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#not-as-insane-idea-heuristics"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Not as Insane Idea - Heuristics
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The insane idea is indeed a bit too much. But there are things we can do to reach a similar effect for most common code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d say 98% of objects fall into pretty common patterns for creation and conventions. By just programming the most common heuristics, we can probably auto-generate 98% of the tests correctly and the last 2% well… That’s probably a tiny fix to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a class has a setter matching the field name… Great problem solved&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the class doesn’t have a default constructor, but has a constructor that accepts parameters matching the fields. Pass the fields based on argument name or type if the name doesn’t match&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If neither of those match check for a static method that returns the class instance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, look for builder calls &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I choose to take this route, I’ll probably implement the first two for the MVP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-hack"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Hack
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another approach is to skip this altogether and serialize the object. We can allocate and inject the fields. Unfortunately, I doubt the code would look great. I think that’s the main reason the ideas above are so appealing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for pure data objects, this might not be a terrible idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-obvious-idea-mocking"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Obvious Idea (Mocking)
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, mocking all objects that are passed in has its value. But I’m not sure if that’s what we would really like to do. Mocking code is pretty verbose. It also doesn’t increase the coverage of the mocked class. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if we go with the mocked approach, this still wouldn’t be trivial and can end up nesting a lot since the mocked object might need to return another (mocked) object and so forth. The nesting can become quite difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-im-doing-right-now"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What I’m Doing Right Now
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still at the early stage of collecting data, so I’m just collecting value object data into a simplified object. Essentially, a type of string and an object. If it's a primitive value, then it’s simple. I just store the value.&lt;br&gt;
Initially, I tried to simplify the approach for an object. I thought that if it’s an object, I can create a Map with the fields of the object that aren’t transient. I’d have a nesting constant and a recursion blocker that would stop me from going too deep into an object hierarchy. This would have allowed me to detect a link to the same object and use the same reference internally to avoid a problem. That last part I might still need. I also have a plan to block recursion so it won’t go deeper than 3 levels by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I don’t think that’s a workable solution. We’ll run into problems when we try to generate code based on that. I think we need to implement the “not as insane” idea and I think that’s a workable approach. To get this working, I need an additional data point. I need to cache the class objects that we can create and those that can’t. If we can create a class, we will mark it. Assuming there’s a process to create the class, we’ll know the fields that need saving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we can’t create a class, we might still have the option of generating a mock for that class, so a test might still be possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I’m writing this, I’m also coding the logic which will be extensive. Tomorrow it might turn out that I implemented something completely different...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#increasing-coverage"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Increasing Coverage
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I merged the PR I worked on yesterday with decent coverage. Turns out I was missing the &lt;code&gt;lombok.config&lt;/code&gt; file. It isn’t essential, but you need to add the entry:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;lombok.addLombokGeneratedAnnotation=true
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, code generated by Lombok isn’t marked as generated code and is included in the coverage statistics. I had 30% coverage with 11 lines uncovered... Adding this changed the dynamic to 83%. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#today"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Today
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that sucked at the end of day yesterday… Turns out I copy pasted a typo in the document title for the last couple of days and it said DDJT instead of DDTJ. Ugh. I can’t fix it. It’s in the URLs, it’s syndicated etc. Spell checkers should really check the titles, but to be fair, they don’t even check the acronyms at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, today will be better. I plan to pull out the object state and fields as we step over the code. I was hoping for something running by the end of the week, but that will probably only happen next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you find this interesting/useful it would be great if you &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/debugagent"&gt;follow me on twitter&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>jQuery Validation [Number] </title>
      <author>bikashgosai</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 11:18:38 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/bikashgosai/jquery-validation-number-2e09</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/bikashgosai/jquery-validation-number-2e09</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here is simple jQuery validation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTML code:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;form id="formId" method="post"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;div class="body"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;input class="form-control text-right" type="number" name="fieldName" min="0" max="1000" /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;div class="footer"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;button type="button" onclick="clearValidation()" class="btn btn-sm" &amp;gt;Cancel&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;button id="btnSubmit" type="button or submit" class="btn btn-sm"&amp;gt;Submit&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Put this code on document ready.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$("#formId").validate({
        rules: {
            fieldName: {
                required: true,
                number: true,
                min: 1
            }
        },
        messages: {
            fieldName: {
//Custom messages
                required: "Required",
                min: "Value must be greater than 0"
            }
        }
    });
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Check if fields are valid according to rules defined above:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;var form = $("#formId");
    if (form.valid()) {
        //do something...
    }
else
{
return;
}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is code for removing validation on form.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
function clearValidation() {
    var form = $("#formId").validate();
    form.resetForm();
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Building a simple Colour Picker in React from scratch</title>
      <author>Jeremy</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 11:08:01 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/jeremyling/building-a-simple-colour-picker-from-scratch-3pdp</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/jeremyling/building-a-simple-colour-picker-from-scratch-3pdp</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While working on reducing &lt;a href="https://formblob.com"&gt;FormBlob&lt;/a&gt;'s dependencies and browser package size, I wrote a lightweight version of a colour picker to replace react-color. I've published it as the open source library &lt;a href="https://github.com/jzcling/react-mui-color"&gt;react-mui-color&lt;/a&gt;, though that has a dependency on Material UI. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tutorial takes you through how to create a colour picker from scratch with no dependencies, similar to what you see below. The full code can be found &lt;a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/color-picker-tzo31"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Don't be daunted if you're not familiar with Typescript, what you'd find here is absolutely understandable if you only know javascript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/color-picker-tzo31"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#key-features"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Key Features
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The colour picker we're about to build will have two different selection options: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a predefined colour palette and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a continuous colour map&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users may set colours using the selectors or key in colours in hex or rgb using inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#planning-the-component"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Planning the Component
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the functional requirements, our colour picker will need 4 props:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt; - the current color selected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;colors&lt;/code&gt; - the array of predefined colours for the colour palette&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;onChange&lt;/code&gt; - the handler when a new colour is selected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;variant&lt;/code&gt; - the type of selector, predefined or free
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ColorPicker.tsx&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ColorPickerVariant&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Predefined&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;predefined&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kr"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ColorPickerProps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;colors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;variant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ColorPickerVariant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ColorPicker&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ColorPickerProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;colors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;variant&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We should also have a component for each selector to make the overall ColorPicker component more manageable and potentially more extensible if we'd like to add more selectors. Our predefined selector is fairly straightforward - we need the &lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;colors&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;onChange&lt;/code&gt; props defined above to populate the component and to handle any colour selections made by the user.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// PredefinedSelector.tsx&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kr"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PredefinedSelectorProps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;colors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onSelect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PredefinedSelector&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PredefinedSelectorProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;colors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onSelect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our colour map selector (we'll call it the Free selector from now on) is more challenging. We need to find a way to render the colour map and convert selections on the map into a colour representation that CSS understands. Fortunately the HSV colour model maps well to a 3D linear gradient, but more on that later. For now, we know that we have two different maps - a larger saturation map and a linear hue map and we need to handle the click event for each map.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// FreeSelector.tsx&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kr"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;FreeSelectorProps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// we'll need to convert this to HSV&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;satCoords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// [x, y] coordinates for saturation map&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;hueCoords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// x coordinates for hue map&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;onSaturationChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;MouseEventHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;onHueChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;MouseEventHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;FreeSelector&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;FreeSelectorProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;satCoords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hueCoords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onSaturationChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onHueChange&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setting-up-the-view"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setting Up The View
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, we have three components:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ColorPicker - the overall component that we will use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PredefinedSelector - the colour palette selector&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FreeSelector - the colour map selector&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We proceed to set up the view for each of the components, beginning with the selectors. Let's get the most difficult component out of the way first - the FreeSelector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, the HSV colour model maps well to a 3D linear gradient. HSV (hue, saturation, value) are each a numerical representation that we can be split into a one-dimensional hue map and a two-dimensional saturation (x) and value (y) map. In order to render these maps, we use the linear-gradient CSS function. Let's see some code.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;FreeSelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.css&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.cp-saturation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;150px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* This provides a smooth representation 
     of brightness, which we overlay with an 
     inline background-color for saturation */&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;linear-gradient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;transparent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;black&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;linear-gradient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;white&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;transparent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;4px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* This allows us to position an absolute
     indicator over the map */&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;relative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;cursor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;crosshair&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.cp-hue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;12px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* This covers the full range of hues */&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;linear-gradient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="m"&gt;#ff0000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="m"&gt;#ffff00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="m"&gt;#00ff00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="m"&gt;#00ffff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="m"&gt;#0000ff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="m"&gt;#ff00ff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="m"&gt;#ff0000&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;999px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* This allows us to position an absolute
     indicator over the map */&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;relative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;cursor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;crosshair&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// FreeSelector.tsx&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./FreeSelector.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;FreeSelector&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;FreeSelectorProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"cp-free-root"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"cp-saturation"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;backgroundColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`hsl(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;parsedColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hsv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;, 100%, 50%)`&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;onSaturationChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        // TODO: create an indicator to show current x,y position
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"cp-hue"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;onHueChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        // TODO: create an indicator to show current hue
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the code above, you might be wondering where parsedColor.hsv.h comes from. This is the hue representation for the HSV colour model. As noted earlier, we need to convert the &lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt; string into the HSV representation. We will cover that later on. For now, we finish up the FreeSelector view. Here is the complete code for the FreeSelector.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;FreeSelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.css&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.cp-free-root&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;grid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="py"&gt;grid-gap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;8px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin-bottom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;16px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;max-width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;400px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.cp-saturation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;150px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;linear-gradient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;transparent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;black&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;linear-gradient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;white&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;transparent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;4px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;relative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;cursor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;crosshair&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.cp-saturation-indicator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;15px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;15px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;solid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#ffffff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;translate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;-7.5px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;-7.5px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;absolute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.cp-hue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;12px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;linear-gradient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="m"&gt;#ff0000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;translate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;-7.5px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;-2px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;absolute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// FreeSelector.tsx&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;satCoords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hueCoords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onSaturationChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onHueChange&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;onSaturationChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"cp-saturation-indicator"&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;backgroundColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;parsedColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;satCoords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;??&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;satCoords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;??&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"cp-hue"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;onHueChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"cp-hue-indicator"&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;backgroundColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;parsedColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hueCoords&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;??&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We finally use the &lt;code&gt;satCoords&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;hueCoords&lt;/code&gt;. These are used to position the indicators for the saturation map and hue map respectively. With the CSS properties position, left, and top, we can position the indicator accurately. Notice that we also use the transform property to adjust for the width and height of the indicator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congrats! The most difficult component is done! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the PredefinedSelector looks simple enough. All we need is a palette of preview colours. Here is the complete code for the PredefinedSelector.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;PredefinedSelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.css&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.cp-predefined-root&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding-bottom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;16px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;flex-direction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;column&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;flex-wrap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;wrap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;max-width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;min-width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;200px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;overflow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="py"&gt;scrollbar-width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;-ms-overflow-style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.cp-predefined-root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;::-webkit-scrollbar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.cp-color-button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;37px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;5px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;4px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;inherit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.cp-preview-color&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* Shadow so we can see white against white */&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;box-shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;3px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rgba&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="m"&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rgba&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;-1px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rgba&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;25px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;25px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

          &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"cp-color-button"&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onSelect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;parsedColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hex&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;1px solid #000000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"cp-preview-color"&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="na"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here, we set the height and width of the root container based on the number of rows we would like and the total number of colours in our palette. We then loop through the &lt;code&gt;colors&lt;/code&gt; array to populate the palette with our predefined colours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we move on to the main ColorPicker component. Now that we're done with the selectors, the only thing new are the inputs. Let's add the views for them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;ColorPicker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.css&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.cp-container&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;12px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;overflow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="py"&gt;scrollbar-width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;-ms-overflow-style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fit-content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.cp-container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;::-webkit-scrollbar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.cp-input-container&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;flex-direction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;justify-content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;space-between&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.cp-input-group&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;grid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="py"&gt;grid-template-columns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="py"&gt;grid-gap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;8px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;align-items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.cp-color-preview&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* Shadow so we can see white against white */&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;box-shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;3px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rgba&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="m"&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rgba&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;-1px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rgba&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

  Handling Color Model and Conversions
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until now, we have not added any logic to handle events in the view. Before we can do that, we'll need to set up the &lt;code&gt;Color&lt;/code&gt; model and the conversion methods between the various colour representations. There are three colour representations that are important for our picker: Hex, RGB and HSV. We thus define the &lt;code&gt;Color&lt;/code&gt; model:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Color.ts&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Color&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;hex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;rgb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ColorRGB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;hsv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ColorHSV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ColorRGB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ColorHSV&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With a bit of Googling, we can find pre-existing methods for colour conversion. Here are the methods I used.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Converters.ts&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ColorHSV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ColorRGB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../Interfaces/Color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;rgbToHex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ColorRGB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hexR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hexG&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember the &lt;code&gt;parsedColor&lt;/code&gt; object we were accessing earlier? We also need a method to convert a string representation of a colour into our &lt;code&gt;Color&lt;/code&gt; model.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hexToRgb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;rgbToHex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;rgbToHsv&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./Converters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;min&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;min&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;min&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;min&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;min&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;min&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the utils file above, I also included the &lt;code&gt;getSaturationCoordinates&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;getHueCoordinates&lt;/code&gt; methods to position our indicators. If you notice, the HSV model maps very nicely into our linear gradients since s and v are percentages. Hue maps to a 360 degree circle, so we need to normalize the value for our linear scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we are ready to add our handlers, which is the last piece of the puzzle. At this point, the only incomplete component is the overall ColorPicker. So let's go back to that.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ColorPicker.tsx&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ColorPicker&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ColorPickerProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;colors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;variant&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;parsedColor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useMemo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;parseColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;satCoords&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useMemo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getSaturationCoordinates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;parsedColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;parsedColor&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hueCoords&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useMemo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getHueCoordinates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;parsedColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;parsedColor&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleHexChange&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useCallback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;clamp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;clientX&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;round&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;360&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hsv&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;parsedColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hsv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;parsedColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hsv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;rgb&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hsvToRgb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hsv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;rgbToHex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;rgb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;parsedColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We start off by parsing the &lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt; string received as prop. Once we get the &lt;code&gt;parsedColor&lt;/code&gt;, we can retrieve the &lt;code&gt;satCoords&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;hueCoords&lt;/code&gt; using our getters. We then define the handlers for the change events in our selectors - &lt;code&gt;handleHexChange&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;handleRgbChange&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;handleSaturationChange&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;handleHueChange&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;handleSaturationChange&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;handleHueChange&lt;/code&gt; are just the inverse functions of &lt;code&gt;getSaturationCoordinates&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;getHueCoordinates&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And.. we're done with the colour picker! Here is the complete code for the ColorPicker.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ColorPicker.tsx&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useCallback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useMemo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;clamp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;DEFAULT_COLOR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;DEFAULT_COLORS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getHueCoordinates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getSaturationCoordinates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hsvToRgb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;parseColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;rgbToHex&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../Utils&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./ColorPicker.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;FreeSelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PredefinedSelector&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./Options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ColorPickerVariant&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Predefined&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;predefined&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kr"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ColorPickerProps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;colors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;variant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ColorPickerVariant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ColorPicker&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ColorPickerProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"cp-input-label"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;htmlFor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"cp-input-g"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"cp-input-g"&lt;/span&gt;

              &lt;span class="na"&gt;placeholder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"G"&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="na"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;parsedColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;rgb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="na"&gt;onChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleRgbChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="na"&gt;inputMode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"numeric"&lt;/span&gt;

              &lt;span class="na"&gt;placeholder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"B"&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="na"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;parsedColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;rgb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="na"&gt;onChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleRgbChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="na"&gt;inputMode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"numeric"&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="na"&gt;pattern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"[0-9]*"&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ColorPicker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;defaultProps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;DEFAULT_COLOR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;colors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;DEFAULT_COLORS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;onChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;variant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ColorPickerVariant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Predefined&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#concluding-remarks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Concluding Remarks
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, the complete code can be found &lt;a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/color-picker-tzo31"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This is an implementation with no dependencies beyond React, but you can always use your favourite UI libraries to replace the views. I would also like to credit &lt;a href="https://github.com/Wondermarin/react-color-palette"&gt;react-color-palette&lt;/a&gt; and this &lt;a href="https://css-tricks.com/converting-color-spaces-in-javascript"&gt;css-tricks article&lt;/a&gt; as I used them as reference for the colour map implementation and colour conversions methods.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inverting a Binary Tree</title>
      <author>Santhosh Balasa</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 11:06:41 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/sbalasa/inverting-a-binary-tree-3d6f</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/sbalasa/inverting-a-binary-tree-3d6f</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Binary Tree:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;         (4)
        /  \
       /    \
     (2)    (7)                  
     / \    /  \
    /   \ (6)  (9)
  (1)   (3)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Inverting a Binary tree means mirroring the tree, i.e, swapping the children from left to right and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inverted Binary Tree:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;         (4)                         
        /  \
       /    \
     (7)    (2)                    
     / \    /  \
    /   \ (3)  (1)
  (9)   (6)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This can be easily achieved using recursion,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;tree = {
    4: [2, 7],
    2: [1, 3],
    7: [6, 9],
    1: [],
    3: [],
    6: [],
    9: []
}


def invert_tree(tree, node, path=[]):
    if tree[node]:
        path.extend(tree[node][::-1])
        invert_tree(tree, tree[node][1], path)
        invert_tree(tree, tree[node][0], path)
    return [node] + path
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>APIs first at the first Sendcloud Engineering Meetup</title>
      <author>Evgeny Sharypin</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 10:59:11 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/sendcloud/apis-first-at-the-first-sendcloud-engineering-meetup-1jac</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/sendcloud/apis-first-at-the-first-sendcloud-engineering-meetup-1jac</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On December 16th, the first Sendcloud meetup took place. We noticed we have a lot of knowledge and experience internally, that we would like to share with a broader audience. At the same time we want to learn from others in our industry. As such, we started this meetup series, and in this blog I'll try and summarize what happened.&lt;br&gt;
​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather just watch a video? Head over to our YouTube channel and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsYfaKCPM9U"&gt;see the live recording&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;br&gt;
​&lt;br&gt;
In &lt;strong&gt;API First: increasing quality while reducing costs&lt;/strong&gt;, Alejandro Lopez Ariza, QA Automation Engineer and &lt;a href="https://www.postman.com/company/supernovas-program/"&gt;Postman Supernova&lt;/a&gt;, states that APIs are the nexus of modern software projects.&lt;br&gt;
​&lt;br&gt;
As an industry we've been shifting steps left in the software development cycle that originally were treated as an afterthought. We tackle things like testing early, and continuously, because we know that the costs associated with fixing a bug that's already in production are exponentially higher than finding it during the design phase. &lt;br&gt;
​&lt;br&gt;
The traditional way of implementing new features posed several problems. Functional requirements influenced by UI constraints, or a lacking multi-device strategy, just to name a few. &lt;br&gt;
​&lt;br&gt;
When we instead treat our APIs as first class citizens, and prioritize their development, we:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove dependencies between teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase productivity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase quality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide a better developer experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve the maintainability of our APIs
​&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alejandro recommends using tools like Swagger or Postman to automatically create documentation (but to treat it as a starting point), and to use API mocking to unblock development and reduce dependency on third parties.&lt;br&gt;
​&lt;br&gt;
In &lt;strong&gt;Carrier SDK: Sendcloud's Story of Switching to Services&lt;/strong&gt;, Evgeny Sharypin, Software Development Manager at Sendcloud, shares how the company transitioned from a monolith to a services system.&lt;br&gt;
​&lt;br&gt;
In early 2020, Sendcloud expected a huge growth in our user base. We knew that our architecture wouldn't stand the challenge. The solution? The Carrier SDK: a collection of APIs and packages. Today there are more than 25 carrier integrations built using this SDK, and by mid 2022, we plan to move all of our existing integrations to be operating within this distributed fleet of services. By 2025 we expect the amount of integrations to be in the hundreds. &lt;br&gt;
​&lt;br&gt;
The Carrier Blueprint is a reusable Python package that serves as a base for all our carrier services and enables us and our integrators to develop new integrations rapidly, while keeping the services’ codebase lean, flexible and easy to maintain. &lt;br&gt;
​&lt;br&gt;
The 'vertical siloing' of our services (carriers) was one of the crucial prerequisites for this project to succeed, as it allowed us to design an HTTP API that would replace the existing Python API, without redefining or refactoring the interface much. &lt;br&gt;
​&lt;br&gt;
The second aspect of carrier integration that played in our favour was that by keeping the state inside our monolith, our services are almost completely stateless. Stateless services don’t compete for shared resources and are easy to scale.&lt;br&gt;
​&lt;br&gt;
A selection of Evgeny's great parting advice:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define milestones upfront, but avoid analysis paralysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a disposable prototype first, and actually dispose of it afterwards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When building a service ecosystem for integrators, provide a template that allows them to focus on the business logic &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use known paradigms, such as 12-factor app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think about observability early on
​&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsYfaKCPM9U"&gt;the recording&lt;/a&gt; for more advice, and Q&amp;amp;A.&lt;br&gt;
​&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Our next meetup is planned for January 13. RSVP on &lt;a href="https://www.meetup.com/sendcloud-engineering/"&gt;meetup.com.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Striver's SDE Sheet Journey - #5 Sort an array of 0s, 1s and 2s</title>
      <author>sachin26</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 10:57:03 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/sachin26/strivers-sde-sheet-journey-5-sort-an-array-of-0s-1s-and-2s-2pcc</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/sachin26/strivers-sde-sheet-journey-5-sort-an-array-of-0s-1s-and-2s-2pcc</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi👋Devs,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you getting something from the series, now we came to the 5th problem, let's solve the problem without wasting any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Problem Statement&lt;/u&gt; :-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;given an array &lt;code&gt;nums&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;strong&gt;Dutch national flag problem&lt;/strong&gt; was proposed by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_national_flag_problem#:~:text=The-,Dutch%20national%20flag%20problem,-%5B1%5D%20is%20a"&gt;Diskstra&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 1:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 2:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#solution-1"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;u&gt;Solution 1&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;we can easily solve this problem by using any sorting algorithm. the sorting algorithm will sort the array &lt;code&gt;nums&lt;/code&gt; in ascending order and that would be our expected output.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#solution-2"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;u&gt;Solution 2&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;the array &lt;code&gt;nums&lt;/code&gt; only contains the three unique values 0's,1's,2's. so what we need to do is just create three variables that store the frequency of the three unique values and after that overwrite the array based on the frequency of the values.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;lets understand this approach step by step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;step-1&lt;/strong&gt; initialize three variable.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;redCount = 0&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;whiteCount = 0&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;blueCount = 0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;step-2&lt;/strong&gt; run a loop from &lt;code&gt;i=0&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;nums.length&lt;/code&gt; and then,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; if &lt;code&gt;nums[i] == red&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; then &lt;code&gt;redCount++&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; if &lt;code&gt;nums[i] == white&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; then &lt;code&gt;whiteCount++&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; if &lt;code&gt;nums[i] == blue&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt; then &lt;code&gt;blueCount++&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;step-3&lt;/strong&gt; again run a loop from &lt;code&gt;i=0&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;nums.length&lt;/code&gt; and then,&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#solution-3"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;u&gt;Solution 3&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;let's discuss the main algorithm that is &lt;strong&gt;three-way partitioning&lt;/strong&gt; was proposed by Dijkstra himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;in this algo we are classifying the &lt;code&gt;nums&lt;/code&gt; array into 3 groups by using three pointers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;step-1&lt;/strong&gt; initialize three pointers &lt;code&gt;redPointer = 0&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;whitePointer = 0&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;bluePointer = nums.length -1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;step-2&lt;/strong&gt; run a loop from &lt;code&gt;whitePointer&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;bluePointer&lt;/code&gt; and then,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; if &lt;code&gt;nums[whitePointer]&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;red&lt;/code&gt; then,&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;swap(whitePointer,redPointer)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;redPointer++&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;whitePointer++&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; if &lt;code&gt;nums[whitePointer]&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;white&lt;/code&gt; then,&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;whitePointer++&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; if &lt;code&gt;nums[whitePointer]&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;blue&lt;/code&gt; then,&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;swap(whitePointer,bluePointer)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;bluePointer--&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;step-4&lt;/strong&gt; end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;look at this picture for a better understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time Complexity⏱️&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;loop running from whitePointer to bluePointer, then&lt;br&gt;
Time Complexity: &lt;strong&gt;O(n)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Space Complexity⛰️&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the algo is not using any extra space then ,&lt;br&gt;
Space Complexity: &lt;strong&gt;O(1)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading this article I tried to stay clean &amp;amp; simple in my explanations and if you like this article then like and share it with your devs friend.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is definitely not a success story, but an example of how to fail a project, despite on good enough programming skills and a big desire to create games. This topic will be useful for people want to be indie-game developers or already started to create The Big Dream Project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-beginning"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The beginning
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As almost every software developer, my passion for programming started when I opened the door to beautiful world of videogames. When I was a schoolboy, I was spell-bounded by all magic happening in buzzing box under my table. At first you just enjoy the game, but after a while you want to investigate how it works. And I started to make first step to puzzle out this mystical world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early 2000s, there were no game development courses yet, there were no mentors, and only a select few had the Internet (Especially in Kazakhstan, where I was born). My acquaintance with game development began with WarCraft, which was released in 2002. After going through the campaign and playing multiplayer with friends (we had a local network between houses), I found the "World Editor" icon in the game files. It turned out to be a map editor, and most importantly, it has its own programming language JASS, with which it is possible to do almost anything, limited only by the developer's imagination. This is how the first Dota was made by the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8A0tpgWc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zwityoviqf1vjec8m7a8.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8A0tpgWc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zwityoviqf1vjec8m7a8.jpeg" alt="WarCraft3 World Editor" width="784" height="560"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that time, I did not know what variables, loops and functions are. I sat in front of the monitor for hours and on an intuitive level tried to figure out all these things. In the end, I even managed to make an analogue of Diablo directly on the WarCraft engine, which my friends later played. Time passed, I mastered 3D Studio Max, Photoshop, Flash, but I didn't seriously develop games. I got an excellent book on programming "How to Program in C ++" by Deitel, where I already plunged headlong into the world of computer software development. Studied C ++, finished several books on Java, mastered HTML/CSS and javascript. Afterall, despite on passion for Computer Science, after graduating from school, I went to college in a completely different specialty and programming was just a hobby for me. (There were no good Higher Education CS programs in Kazakhstan in 2006).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-second-attempt"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Second Attempt
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kazakhstan lagged behind the world in the field of IT for several years. I returned to the software development industry in my second or third year of studying in University, it was a time of  active growth of Internet speed, various startups appeared. Having a good basic understanding of how to write code, but not having an understanding of how to make a "Product", I realized that I needed a mentor. And I was very lucky, I met a person who took me under his wing. I have mastered Ruby and successfully burst into the world of software development. Several years passed. Ultimately, there was a desire to plunge into the world of computer games again, excellent tools appeared, such as Unity, Unreal Engine, Godot. In addition, I was motivated by the successful case of my friends, &lt;a href="https://katata.games/"&gt;Katata Games&lt;/a&gt;, a family development studio, who released the "Top Run" mobile game, which reached 100,000 downloads in the AppStore and Play Market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I started to create my first game. From previous web programming experience, I knew that you can't grasp the immensity, that you need to start small. As a result, the idea was born to create a mobile game about a drill, on which you need to reach the core of the planet. With each next attempt, the drill can be improved, increasing your piloting experience and gradually reaching ever greater depths. My main goal was to create a product, albeit small, albeit simple, but complete. As a result, I fell into a trap. I have never played mobile games, I have always been interested in the PC with its hardcore and multifaceted games. And I decided that since I know the PC games market well, it won't be difficult for me to make a game specifically for PC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7F6BhzjA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hste2tx7tkyc3d17t5ho.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7F6BhzjA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hste2tx7tkyc3d17t5ho.gif" alt="A gameplay fragment" width="690" height="388"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have connected different ideas into one blanket. As a result, the idea of ​​a game was born, which I called Shoot.Pray.Run., A top-down action-rpg about a war monk who descends into hell to defeat the main evil, simultaneously destroying all enemies along the way. The "Priest" movie made a big impression on me with its style, so I took it as a basis. I took the system of dungeons from Diablo 1, where you have to constantly go lower and lower into hell, and game mechanics were taken from "Enter the Gungeon". Everything was simple in my head, I improved skills in pixel art, also found a good artist for characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All sketches were made by me to simplify the explanation of tasks to the artist (e.g. main character, skeleton and banshee):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Uv_FN404--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2wsulnfglsqjq9wt9mg3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Uv_FN404--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2wsulnfglsqjq9wt9mg3.png" alt="Sketches" width="800" height="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unity conquered me, I quickly figured it out and it seemed that with it I would do almost any project (Dunning-Kruger Effect). The code flowed like a river, and the game started to take it form. And then I made a mistake, I decided to leave my main job to male the game from morning to evening, every day. If you do not have experience in game development, then by no means do this, there are too many pitfalls in this industry. As soon as I started working on game full-time, the thought came to me that I could do more than I had planned. And here I again fell into the trap of a large project, it was not small anyway, and I began to wind up a lot of different mechanics there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--u9oZsxpw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hi8f8lyafs77wpzsqdjt.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--u9oZsxpw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hi8f8lyafs77wpzsqdjt.gif" alt="Water and light" width="592" height="454"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I made volumetric light, then I came to 3D with 2D imitation. I wanted to keep the pixel art, but give it a depth. This required rewriting the camera so that it did not distort the textures of the walls and floor at an angle of 45%, but left them pixel-perfect drawn. I dived into shaders, started expanding the game with these beauties, created water, steam, heat effects, etc. The cherry on top is the object destructibility system. I wanted everything in the game to be destroyable. This not only made the code and art more complicated, but would also lead to game design problems in the future. The result was a huge monster, the project grew larger and larger, I had already spent several months, but it was not yet possible to play the game. It was just a collection of all sorts of technical wow-effects, but there was no gameplay itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IsU_qUM6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r1k6d2i6o3c0ycnnkc8f.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IsU_qUM6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r1k6d2i6o3c0ycnnkc8f.gif" alt="Destruction 1" width="690" height="388"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ees031Lt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/33i406wc3boo4hkdnbve.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ees031Lt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/33i406wc3boo4hkdnbve.gif" alt="Destruction 2" width="690" height="388"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depression knocked to my door and I started to understand that I was trying to bite off too large a piece, but I did not stop. Despite the awareness of the problem, I walked like a tank into the abyss. Continued to complicate minor things, not paying attention to the gameplay itself. Added gender selection so that you can play as a woman. We prepared various cool arts for twitter and reddit, but there was still no game. In total, I have already spent about five months, but I did not even have the first level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MbhjrZRD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/92jf9i1gfe29gtbzhzwo.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MbhjrZRD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/92jf9i1gfe29gtbzhzwo.gif" alt="Heroes are chilling" width="620" height="434"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My financial reserve provided me for a year of work, but I understood that at this pace I would be making the game for a couple of years, no less (and this was an optimistic forecast). The development did not bring any pleasure or satisfaction any more. Only the fear grew that I would be left with nothing. I had the will to stop developing the game and return to my usual job as a web programmer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#now"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Now
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my free time, I continue to work with Unity, make some small games and mechanics. I am improving my skills in various aspects of game development: game design, programming, art. I may return to serious game development in the distant future, but I will definitely try not to make the same mistakes again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lessons I learned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not quit your main job if there is no finished game project yet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on game core. The game should be interesting even if it is assembled from squares and other primitives. Complexity and beauty can always be added later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a fully working product, albeit small, albeit crooked and oblique. The ability to complete a project is the most useful thing in game development, and in any other industry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
