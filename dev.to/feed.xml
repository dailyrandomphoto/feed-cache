      <title>Is there a way to convert dynamically allocated memory to static memory OR copy ptr contents in C/C++?</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reference, static memory is memory that is memory that is assigned, managed, and freed for you (an example is &lt;code&gt;char const* str = "Hello World!";&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;br&gt;
C/C++ will clean that string up for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Dynamically allocated memory is memory you request, manage, and must clean yourself (an example is &lt;code&gt;Type_t* array = malloc( sizeof(Type_t)*arrLength );&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm messing around with C strings in C++, even testing ideas for my own &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; type. - And I was creating a &lt;code&gt;String +(char c)&lt;/code&gt; method, when I thought of something: "How can I return a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; object whose &lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt; property is statically allocated, and not dynamically allocated?".&lt;br&gt;
Since the only method of adding a character to an immutable string I can think of involves using &lt;code&gt;malloc( (oldStrLen+1)*sizeof(char) )&lt;/code&gt;, which is dynamically allocated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So, is there a way I can copy the contents of a pointer to a &lt;strong&gt;new&lt;/strong&gt; statically allocated pointer, or convert dynamically allocated memory to statically allocated memory in C/C++?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thanks!&lt;br&gt;Cheers!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

      <title>Electron Adventures: Episode 99: Should You Use Electron?</title>
      <author>Tomasz Wegrzanowski</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 14 Nov 2021 21:40:38 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/taw/electron-adventures-episode-99-should-you-use-electron-4cek</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/taw/electron-adventures-episode-99-should-you-use-electron-4cek</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So now that my 100-episode Electron Adventure series is coming to a close, I want to spend the final two episodes on a retrospective. This episode will be about Electron, and the next one about the series itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#idea-behind-electron"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Idea behind Electron
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cross-platform GUI development has always been a huge pain. Your choices were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write the app multiple times, once for each platform, in multiple different low-level languages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use some "cross-platform" lowest common denominator solution like various Java toolkits that results in an awful experience for everyone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;just drop the whole idea and make the app single platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, web development was ridiculously easy, and ridiculously powerful, and it was all cross-platform by definition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the whole idea behind Electron was basically "screw all that, we'll just ship a whole browser with the app". And it worked. So well that today you'd be very hard pressed to name any decent cross-platform GUI apps that aren't Electron apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-is-electron-controversial"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why is Electron controversial?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever anyone mentions Electron, it instantly triggers haters who absolutely cannot stand the idea of bundling the whole browser. The haters are especially bitter because they are losing utterly, and they cannot even begin to offer any alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first objection is that it takes too much space. This was always a stupid argument, and it got even worse as time goes. Even the shitty entry level laptops have 256GB+ disks these days, so if you download 100 Electron apps at 100MB each - not something a typical user does - even that's less than 4% of your laptop's disk. And this becomes less and less relevant as time goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But really this isn't Electron specific issue. The whole software world moved hard to "bundle all the things" mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The days where an app would just use whatever happened to be installed on a local machine are gone. Every app comes with a &lt;code&gt;package-lock.json&lt;/code&gt; or its equivalent specifying exact versions of every single dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that goes even further. Instead of just bundling some JavaScript libraries with &lt;code&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt;, or some browser with Electron, more and more apps just bundle a whole Linux distribution with Docker, and run that. Or they bundle a whole collection of Dockers for different parts of the app, with multiple Linux distributions inside. Some recent languages like Go basically decided to not even support traditional shared libraries - if you use some code, you have to bundle it into a single executable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electron deciding to bundle the browser back in 2013 was ahead of its times, but now this is hardly a controversial decision. Everyone bundles everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#web-based-alternatives"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Web based alternatives
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the series, we tried a huge number of alternatives to Electron, and found all of them to be pretty bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's two kinds of alternatives to Electron. The first is all the other web-based solutions that just don't bundle the browser, and use whatever's installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In principle this works, as long as the user has a recent version of Chrome or such, like with Ferrum. But they need to be strict about it, and if no Chrome (or Chromium) is found, they need to just tell the user to install it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even that doesn't quite solve the problem. Electron bundles two things - browser and node. Even if we use user's browser, we still need to bundle the backend language, and none of the languages have easy cross-platform bundling story. OSX comes with really old versions of Ruby and Python, Windows comes with .NET, Linux comes with whatever each distro decides (at least some sort of Python), none of them were made with portability in mind. It would be great if we could just ship an app in a Docker to the user, just like we can with servers, but we're not there yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, every alternative we've tried that used OS-bundled HTML view, like Safari, os whatever Qt has, and so on - all of them have been a total disaster. The web is easy to develop for, as it's basically all Chrome, or things that try to keep up with Chrome. Not having to deal with IE11 or obsolete Safari or some half-working toolkit-specific browsers is definitely worth paying for with a 100MB download.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#non-web-alternatives"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Non web alternatives
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing we tried were a bunch of non-web-based alternatives. I tried to pick the most promising ones, and skip the obvious trash, but none of them were acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it's no surprise really. Every Java-based GUI I've seen was a barely functioning disaster, and Qt-based GUIs were not much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to mention none of them really solve our problems. OK, so we don't bundle the browser, but is telling user to "install Java" or "install Qt" actually better than telling them to "install Chrome"?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as I said before, we'd still need to somehow install the backend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#best-choices"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Best choices
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think anything can really compete with Electron when it comes to cross-platform desktop apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best Web based alternative would be either "just run in the user's browser" (Jupyter style) any of the "ask the user to install Chrome" solutions (Ferrum style). I think these could be turned into viable solutions with modest effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judging only by the quality of GUI programs I've used, I suspect the best of the non-Web alternatives would be .NET. It comes preinstalled with Windows, which is otherwise the most painful system to target, and it can sort of work on other systems. As I was writing the series on a Mac, I never tried that, but I've seen others be somewhat successful with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Qt based solutions were mediocre at best, and Java based solutions were all an unmitigated disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-use-electron"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to use Electron
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I recommend Electron so strongly, what do I recommend using with it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the language, vanilla JavaScript. We've long been promised ability to use any language for web development, but so far none of such promises have been delivered. Flavored JavaScript (CoffeeScript, TypeScript, etc.) don't really offer anything meaningful for their cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the framework, you can't go wrong with Svelte, which is the leading 3rd generation framework. There's nothing too wrong with using React, which was the leading 2nd generation framework, but React is extremely limited by being based on web capabilities and thinking from the mid IE era, and has a big advantage that you're more likely to know it, but looking forward, Svelte is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think other frameworks really have much to offer that those two don't. I really wanted to try Imba 2 with the series, but Imba 2's tooling was really getting in the way of Electron, and I was able to fix some of these issues but not all, so I ended up dropping the idea (I definitely ought to PR those fixes). Maybe Imba will be the next Svelte, but it's not there now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for Electron, due to its origin in attaching browser frontend to node backend with some IPC duct tape, many of its architectural choices are really awkward, with many concerns being on the wrong side of the frontend/backend divide, or even worse split between both. Fortunately, there's a lively ecosystem of npm packages that deal with a lot of that awkwardness around things like managing window positions, saving user settings, and so on, and you should absolutely check if there's a package that solves your problem instead of forcing yourself to use plain Electron alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#coming-next"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Coming next
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that concludes everything I wanted to say about Electron. In the final 100th episode of the series, I'll look back at what it was like to write a 100-episode daily blog post series.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Week III Task Force 4.0</title>
      <author>Placideh</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 14 Nov 2021 21:24:01 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/placideh/week-iii-task-force-40-o94</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code Can't Lie 🤣 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello again, now I could say that I am already a Task Force🦾 , this week was cool and super I have experienced working as a team and the merits from it. Basically this is the week that the team(Task-Force) really become one element, by this we started working together brainstorming to come up with a great &lt;strong&gt;MVP&lt;/strong&gt;(Minimum Viable Product), I have also liked the way we started sharing our own personal life experience which was also a great takeaway like Empathy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have loved the Soft skills that I have been introduced to, ain't going to lie it was really a valuable sessions. As Backend Developers we also have to work and collaborate on Technical skills that's where the team working , cooperation and creativity comes to play, This week we have worked on &lt;strong&gt;ERD&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Entity relationship diagram&lt;/em&gt; mainly we've designed possible Entities to be used in our project not only that we have  created their cardinalities as well as creating their &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SQL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; queries . throughout SQL I have come to see a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;json&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; datatype in MySql🤔 That's made me  realize that This Field is all about learning journey, The more you learn the more you tend to find you know less but, in anyways it is great and super.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't wait to see you the next Week !!! ✌.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TypeScript ANY vs UNKNOWN—A Deep Dive</title>
      <author>Tom Dohnal</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 14 Nov 2021 21:23:30 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/tomdohnal/typescript-any-vs-unknown-a-deep-dive-3iem</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/tomdohnal/typescript-any-vs-unknown-a-deep-dive-3iem</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, we'll dive deep into what &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt; types are, what are their similarities and differences, and when (not) to use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(You can find a video version of this article on YouTube! 📺)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O6UUEeq0oSg"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tldr"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  TLDR;
&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ANY&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;anyValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;any&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;whatever&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// OK in TypeScript (error in runtime!) 👇&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;anyValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;something&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stupid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; 


&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// UNKNOWN&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknownValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknown&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;whatever, too&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Fails TypeScript check (prevents runtime error) 👇&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknownValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;something&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stupid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mnemonics to help you remember the difference 👇&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -&amp;gt; first letter is an "A" -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;Avoid&lt;/em&gt; TypeScript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -&amp;gt; first letter is a "U" -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;Use&lt;/em&gt; TypeScript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#table-of-contents"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Table of Contents
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#chapter-1"&gt;The &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; Type&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#chapter-2"&gt;The &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt; Type&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#chapter-3"&gt;Use Cases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-raw-any-endraw-type"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; Type
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; type is something like an escape hatch from TypeScript. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your variable is of type &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt;, you can:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1. Assign whatever you want to it 👇&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;anyValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;anyValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;hi, how is you? :)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;anyValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;login&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;password?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. "Do" whatever you want with it 👇&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;anyValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;any&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// OK in TypeScript but error in runtime&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ("...is not a function")&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;anyValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toUpperCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// OK in TypeScript but error in runtime&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ("...Cannot read properties of undefined")&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;anyValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;messages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;:)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, using &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; allows you to use variables &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; type checking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uOHRx9PB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sndm73objhbmpssml6gx.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uOHRx9PB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sndm73objhbmpssml6gx.jpg" alt='soldier being shot by an arrow saying "any"' width="636" height="767"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(&lt;a href="https://devrant.com/rants/3015646/i-dont-usually-post-memes-but-this-one-is-just-a-little-too-on-the-nose"&gt;https://devrant.com/rants/3015646/i-dont-usually-post-memes-but-this-one-is-just-a-little-too-on-the-nose&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that you lose the main benefit TypeScript has to offer–preventing runtime errors due to accessing non-existing properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might now wonder &lt;strong&gt;why the heck would I even use &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; if it means giving up type checking altogether?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, you should strive to avoid it. To do that, I'd advise you to:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1) Use &lt;code&gt;"strict": true&lt;/code&gt; in your &lt;code&gt;tsconfig.json&lt;/code&gt; file to disable &lt;em&gt;implicit&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; types&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Implicit any&lt;/em&gt; means that if you don't annotate a variable or a function parameter in TypeScript, it'll be &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; by default. With &lt;code&gt;"strict": true&lt;/code&gt;, the TypeScript compiler will throw an error if you've got an unannotated variable of type &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Use the &lt;a href="https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/master/packages/eslint-plugin/docs/rules/no-explicit-any.md"&gt;&lt;code&gt;no-explicit-any&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; rule in &lt;a href="https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint"&gt;TypeScript ESLint&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; This will give you an ESLint warning whenever you use &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are some situations where &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; is helpful. We'll cover the main use cases in &lt;a href="#chapter-3"&gt;the final section&lt;/a&gt; in depth. Nonetheless, it can be useful when migrating JavaScript code to TypeScript or when dealing with untyped external libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Careful! Some built-in TypeScript types use &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When using functions like &lt;code&gt;JSON.parse(...)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;fetch(...).then(res =&amp;gt; res.json())&lt;/code&gt;, the type of the result is &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use something like &lt;code&gt;JSON.parse(...) as { message: string }&lt;/code&gt; to give it a proper type. Nonetheless, it's useful to know about these as it's very easy to accidentally use &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; without even knowing about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use rules such as &lt;a href="https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/master/packages/eslint-plugin/docs/rules/no-unsafe-assignment.md"&gt;&lt;code&gt;no-unsafe-assingment&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint"&gt;TypeScript ESLint&lt;/a&gt; to get warnings in such scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does TypeScript behave in this &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; type-safe manner? Well, one of the possible explanations is that there was no other way to type these built-in JavaScript functions as there was no &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt; type that would be better suited for this job. Let's have a look at what it does and how it differs from the &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-raw-unknown-endraw-type"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt; Type
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt; type was added to TypeScript in 2018 with its version &lt;code&gt;3.0&lt;/code&gt; release. Its purpose was to provide a type-safe alternative to &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the official docs:&lt;br&gt;
TypeScript 3.0 introduces a new top type &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt; is the type-safe counterpart of &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt;. (&lt;a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-0.html#new-unknown-top-type"&gt;https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-0.html#new-unknown-top-type&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does that mean?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As the phrase "type-safe counterpart of &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt;" suggests, the &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt; type is similar to the &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; type in some way but different in others (namely, unlike &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt;, it's type-safe).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's first examine the similarities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; assign whatever you want to an &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt; type&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This works pretty much the same way as the &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; type 👇&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknownValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknown&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknownValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;hey, how&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;re you doing? :)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknownValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;signUp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;email?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With variables of type &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; you could do anything with such variables (call them, access random properties on them, etc.). This is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the case with &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt;, TypeScript &lt;strong&gt;makes &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; assumptions about your variables&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknownVariable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknown&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Error in TypeScript 👇&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknownVariable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toUpperCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Error in TypeScript 👇&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknownVariable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;how&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;you&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;today?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Error in TypeScript 👇&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;newVariable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknownVariable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is very helpful as it prevents you from accidentally accessing non-existent properties, treating strings like functions etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; of the &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt; type as of something like&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknown&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the actual definition of the &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt; type. It's just a simplified model to give you a better intuition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#type-narrowing-with-raw-unknown-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Type narrowing with &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we saw in the code snippet above, TypeScript doesn't allow you to do almost anything with the &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt; type. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one hand, it's very useful as it keeps your code type-safe and prevents you from the dreaded runtime JavaScript TypeErrors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it's quite limiting as we'd like to be able to manipulate our variables, call properties on them, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've got 2 options for how to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Type Guards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We can use type guards to narrow down the possible types. You can use &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statements or custom &lt;a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#using-type-predicates"&gt;type predicates&lt;/a&gt; to do that.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;logSecretMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// in this if-block we know `message` is of type string&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// so we can call the `toLowerCase()` method on it&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toLowerCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Type Assertions (&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; type-safe)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Alternatively, we can always use type assertions. This is way easier but we lose the type-safety as we use whatever type we want and TypeScript will just "trust" us that we made no mistake:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknownVariable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknown&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// OK 👇&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknownVariable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toUpperCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// OK in TypeScript but it *fails* in runtime 👇&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknownVariable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toFixed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#use-cases-for-raw-any-endraw-and-raw-unknown-endraw-types"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Use Cases for &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt; Types
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we've got understanding of what the &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt; types mean, let's have a look at when (not) to use each of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rule of thumb is that &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; should be avoided since using it makes you lose most of the TypeScript benefits. If you don't know what type a certain variable or a function parameter is, always prefer &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that being said, there are some valid use cases for &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#migrating-to-typescript-from-javascript"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Migrating to TypeScript (from JavaScript)
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; is very useful when migrating JavaScript codebase into TypeScript. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say you've got a large JavaScript file which exports many functions and you want to convert it to TypeScript. Without using &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt;, you'd need to type every single function in this file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's a lot of work and you might just be interested in typing one of the exported functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, you can use &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; to quickly type the functions you're not interested in and only give proper types to the one function you're currently working with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be also useful to create an alias for &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; (such as &lt;code&gt;type TODO = any&lt;/code&gt;) so that you can later come back to your temporarily typed functions and give them proper types.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// auth.ts (migrating from auth.js)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;TODO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// We can just type the `signUp` function&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;signUp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Use `TODO` to quickly type the `resetPassword` function&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;resetPassword&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;TODO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Use `TODO` to quickly type the `logIn` function&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;logIn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;TODO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#functions-with-unknown-arguments"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Functions with unknown arguments
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As previously stated, the &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt; type should be preferred when dealing with variables which types we can't determine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example could be a generic logger function 👇&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;development&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sendMessageToAPI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Had we used &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; instead, we could have accidentally tried to use properties such as &lt;code&gt;.toLowerCase()&lt;/code&gt; (wrongly) assuming that &lt;code&gt;message&lt;/code&gt; is of type &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, using &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt; instead keeps things safe for us 😇&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>React Router V5 vs V6</title>
      <author>Arunava Modak</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 14 Nov 2021 20:55:44 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/arunavamodak/react-router-v5-vs-v6-dp0</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/arunavamodak/react-router-v5-vs-v6-dp0</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;React Router version 6 was released, and it is important as it is one of the most widely used react libraries out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#so-what-is-react-router-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  So What Is React Router ?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;React Router is a fully-featured client and server-side routing library for React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React Router runs anywhere React runs; on the web, on the server with node.js, and on React Native.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In V6, there has been a lot of under the hood changes, be it an enhanced path pattern matching algorithm or addition of new components. Not only that but the bundle size has been reduced by almost 58%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Qe4VIFOQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lh28jy32z6wi0n5ksy0m.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Qe4VIFOQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lh28jy32z6wi0n5ksy0m.gif" alt="Wow" width="470" height="376"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here are some of the changes you can make to upgrade an existing project from React Router v5 to v6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#replacing-raw-switch-endraw-w-raw-routes-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Replacing &lt;code&gt;Switch&lt;/code&gt; w/ &lt;code&gt;Routes&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In v6, &lt;code&gt;Switch&lt;/code&gt; in not exported from &lt;code&gt;react-router-dom&lt;/code&gt;. In the earlier version we could use &lt;code&gt;Switch&lt;/code&gt; to wrap our routes, and code to make one of the route to load at a time. Now we use &lt;code&gt;Routes&lt;/code&gt; to do the same thing instead of &lt;code&gt;Switch&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-route-endraw-definition-changes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;Route&lt;/code&gt; Definition Changes
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The component that should be rendered on matching a route can not be written as a child of the &lt;code&gt;Route&lt;/code&gt; component, but it takes a prop called &lt;code&gt;element&lt;/code&gt; where we have to pass a JSX component for that to be rendered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-raw-exact-endraw-prop-is-not-needed-anymore"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The &lt;code&gt;exact&lt;/code&gt; Prop Is Not Needed Anymore
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With version 6, React Router has just become alot more awesome. There has been some changes under the hood, which enables us to match a particular route match without the &lt;code&gt;exact&lt;/code&gt; prop. Earlier, without &lt;code&gt;exact&lt;/code&gt;, any path starting with the concerned keyword would be loaded, as the matching process was done from top to down the route definitions. But now, we do not have to worry about that, as React Router has a better algorithm for loading the best route for a particular path, the order of defining does not really matters now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, to sum up these three points we can consider this code snippet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#in-v5"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  In v5
&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Switch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react-router-dom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Switch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;exact&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/cryptocurrencies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Cryptocurrencies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;exact&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/crypto/:coinId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;CryptoDetails&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;exact&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/exchanges&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Exchanges&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Switch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

  No Need To Install &lt;code&gt;react-router-config&lt;/code&gt; Seperately
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;react-router-config&lt;/code&gt; allowed us to define our routes as javascript objects, instead of React elements, and all it's functionalities have to moved in the core react router v6.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

  &lt;code&gt;useHistory&lt;/code&gt; Is Now &lt;code&gt;useNavigate&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React Router v6 now has the navigate api, which most of the times would mean replacing &lt;code&gt;useHistory&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;useNavigate&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class="nx"&gt;history&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//V6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useNavigate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react-router-dom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;navigate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useNavigate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;navigate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;go&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some more common features of &lt;code&gt;useHistory&lt;/code&gt; were &lt;code&gt;go&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;goBack&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;goForward&lt;/code&gt;. These can also be achieved by navigate api too, we just need to mention the number of steps we want to move forward or backward ('+' for forward and '-' for backward). So we can code these features we can consider this.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//V5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useHistory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react-router-dom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Exchanges&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;go&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;goBack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;goForward&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useHistory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;go&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;back&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;goBack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;step&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;back&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;goForward&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;step&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;forward&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;go&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;forward&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//V6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useNavigate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react-router-dom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;navigate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-activestyle-endraw-and-raw-activeclassname-endraw-props-removed-from-raw-ltnavlink-gt-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;activeStyle&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;activeClassName&lt;/code&gt; Props Removed From &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;NavLink /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the previous version we could set a seperate class or a style object for the time when the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;NavLink/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; would be active. In V6, these two props are removed, instead in case of Nav Links className and style props, work a bit differently. They take a function which in turn gives up some information about the link, for us to better control the styles.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//V5&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;activeStyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Exchanges&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#replace-raw-redirect-endraw-with-raw-navigate-endraw-"&gt;

  Replace &lt;code&gt;Redirect&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;Navigate&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Redirect&lt;/code&gt; is no longer exported from &lt;code&gt;react-router-dom&lt;/code&gt;, instead we use can &lt;code&gt;Navigate&lt;/code&gt; to achieve the same features.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//V5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Redirect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react-router-dom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;exact&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/latest-news&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Redirect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/news&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;exact&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/news&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;News&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//V6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Navigate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react-router-dom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/latest-news&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Navigate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;replace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/news&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/news&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Home&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Please note the &lt;code&gt;replace&lt;/code&gt; prop passed inside the &lt;code&gt;element&lt;/code&gt; of the &lt;code&gt;Route&lt;/code&gt;. This signifies we are replacing the current navigation stack. Without &lt;code&gt;replace&lt;/code&gt; it would mean we are just pushing the component in the existing navigation stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it for today. Hope this helps you upgrading your react project, to React Router V6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading !! 😇😇&lt;br&gt;
Happy Coding !! Happy Building !!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to plan a React project? For beginners</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/jonathanazerty/how-to-plan-a-react-project-for-beginners-16pg</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STEP 1: CONCEPT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;STEP 2: APPROACH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;STEP 3: ORGANIZE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;STEP 4: BUILD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;STEP 5: INSPECT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;STEP 6: REFLECT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHY DO YOU NEED A PLAN?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, you need a strategy to begin with a project to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;set the direction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;establish the priorities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for the project.&lt;br&gt;
It will &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;help&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; you (and others if you work on a group project) to make it &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;clear what to work on&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;easy to communicate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; with clients (and colleagues/boss).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planning will give you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;control&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;timeline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;reassurance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;efficiency&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;productivity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;progress&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;flexibility&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and of course the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;desired results&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact remains that a lot of things are beyond human control, but for those things that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;are controllable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, planning &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ensures you more control&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; over the project, which leads to a better result !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't underestimate planning!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;so START PLANNING !&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STEP 1: CONCEPT&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;You can skip this part if you already got a concept&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;br&gt;
So before you actually start building, you should to think about what exactly should be built. &lt;br&gt;
Start brainstorming about some ideas &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STEP 2: APPROACH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Write down how you will be working&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and if you will &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;use certain tools to help&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; with that. &lt;br&gt;
Like Todoist for example. See image.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;TODOIST&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://todoist.com/"&gt;https://todoist.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BhGaZYiv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/p3lyqixsz7004nyeh9iv.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BhGaZYiv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/p3lyqixsz7004nyeh9iv.jpg" alt="Image description" width="880" height="443"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In the Todoist you can for example start with the following structure.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Backlog, in progress, weekly planning and documents&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backlog &amp;amp; in progress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8iXvGXfY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/umy7vcj1jqegjmgux1xe.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8iXvGXfY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/umy7vcj1jqegjmgux1xe.JPG" alt="Image description" width="729" height="706"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weekly planning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Add the documents as a comment to keep track.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qzvSMbOx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/36siowwwldb80na2n01k.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qzvSMbOx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/36siowwwldb80na2n01k.JPG" alt="Image description" width="364" height="615"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Documents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8Kuyg1xa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ivlrvclfibn57yo3qwvb.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8Kuyg1xa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ivlrvclfibn57yo3qwvb.JPG" alt="Image description" width="377" height="729"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you've done that, you can continue with the components.&lt;br&gt;
The most important thing in React are the components to start building the structure.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore, it is very important to &lt;strong&gt;sketch the structure of the components&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
As you can see on the following image.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XsAW580E--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9lg4xjnets67j166m1gx.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XsAW580E--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9lg4xjnets67j166m1gx.JPG" alt="Image description" width="880" height="465"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After creating a clear structure on the Todoist and the components, you start with making it &lt;strong&gt;visual on for example FIGMA&lt;/strong&gt;(wireframe).&lt;br&gt;
Here you can start creating with the components you just thought of.&lt;br&gt;
As you can see on the following image for example.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;FIGMA&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.figma.com/"&gt;https://www.figma.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ggwtaL8k--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qqibg5drofpdy9p04e2d.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ggwtaL8k--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qqibg5drofpdy9p04e2d.JPG" alt="Image description" width="880" height="413"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After figuring that out, it would also help to think about what techniques you would like to use and therefore which packages to use and write them down as well on the Todoist.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QDVIPtKv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/crcdzr6qnqiwrnnvbjqr.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QDVIPtKv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/crcdzr6qnqiwrnnvbjqr.JPG" alt="Image description" width="880" height="748"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course what's going to be your Git strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STEP 3: ORGANIZE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Once you got the approach figured out, it's time to start organizing what has been thought of for the project.&lt;br&gt;
If it's a group project, you can make it clear on who does what and when.&lt;br&gt;
Even when you are alone, you can &lt;strong&gt;write down when and what you will do&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Here you can find an example of a weekly planning.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;WEEK1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GdpjTfJf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/46xqrew8xgoznzauq29a.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GdpjTfJf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/46xqrew8xgoznzauq29a.JPG" alt="Image description" width="669" height="723"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Which you can add as a comment in the Todoist.&lt;br&gt;
Also plan for time to work on unforseen issues&lt;br&gt;
Besides this weekly planning it's very important to &lt;strong&gt;start the day with a short 5min meeting on what you will do that day&lt;/strong&gt; and if there are problems, try to fix them if you don't manage to then try to fix it together or ask help!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication is key !&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focus should also be on building itself, therefore, think about the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;folder structure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; as well. (this will depend on what kind of project you have).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STEP 4: BUILD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After preparing so well in advance, you will be so eager to start coding on your project !&lt;br&gt;
Start with everything that was talked about.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Enjoy the journey and have fun!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STEP 5: INSPECT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After building the whole project, it's always important to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;take some time to inspect&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; the whole project. Adjust where needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STEP 6: REFLECT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Once you're done inspecting the pages, it's also important to take time to reflect on the project.&lt;br&gt;
To &lt;em&gt;**reflect on what went well and what went wrong&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, *&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;to avoid making those mistakes on the next project&lt;/em&gt;** and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;using what went well on the new project&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; so you keep growing and improving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hopefully this will help you out when planning your next or current project !&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don't every forget to have fun, be curious and be eager to learn !&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Host a static website on AWS under a minute with Terraform</title>
      <author>Emre Oztoprak</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 14 Nov 2021 20:23:32 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/aws-builders/host-a-static-website-on-aws-under-a-minute-with-terraform-3hmd</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/aws-builders/host-a-static-website-on-aws-under-a-minute-with-terraform-3hmd</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you have a static website and you want a simple solution, S3 and Cloudfront are great choices. S3 with Cloudfront secure, scalable way to host static content. Also, we will get an SSL certificate for our domain and it will be free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prerequisites"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Prerequisites
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the deployment of this terraform module, make sure your hosted zone exists in Route 53 and move your domain to Route53 by changing NS records on your DNS provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--icnRWvWe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7tophd1lmax66q2podj4.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--icnRWvWe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7tophd1lmax66q2podj4.jpg" alt="terraform-s3-cloudfront-route53" width="750" height="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will use 4 AWS Services;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;S3 - Storing website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudfront - CDN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certificate Manager - SSL Certificate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Route 53 - DNS records&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we are using Cloudfront we don't need the public bucket, so we will create a private S3 bucket. We will use OAI (Origin Access Identity) settings when we create Cloudfront. This means that only our Cloudfront distribution can access and read the files in our S3 bucket. Also, we will create an SSL certificate from Certificate Manager and Cloudfront redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--X9mtn7kV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8gxdt39ga82ch41dafw6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--X9mtn7kV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8gxdt39ga82ch41dafw6.png" alt="cloudfront-oai" width="555" height="324"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First clone the repository&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone git@github.com:emreoztoprak/terraform-aws-s3-cloudfront-acm.git

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Change these two variables in the &lt;strong&gt;terraform.tfvars&lt;/strong&gt; file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
SiteTags = "Example" (Tag value of the resources.)

domainName = "example.com"

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can now run this module when you change the variables.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;terraform init
terraform plan
terrafom apply --auto-approve

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the deployment is completed upload your website files to in S3 Bucket. I configured DefaultRootObject as index.html. Basically, when users access your root URL they will see index.html file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just uploaded a simple HTML file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations. You made it. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--aE1WUO-6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zvx04yfdub78ls5g9z0e.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--aE1WUO-6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zvx04yfdub78ls5g9z0e.png" alt="aws-cloudfront" width="880" height="558"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you find this tutorial helpful!&lt;/p&gt;
