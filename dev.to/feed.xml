      <guid>https://dev.to/beautyjames/basic-concepts-of-java-19k4</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello readers, Beauty James here again with another exciting article. I’ve been talking about Frontend development for some time now so I’ll be considering Java, one of the many examples of programming languages used for Frontend development. I will be discussing the following headings below;&lt;br&gt;
• What is Java?&lt;br&gt;
• History of Java programming language&lt;br&gt;
• Java Features&lt;br&gt;
• Java Architecture&lt;br&gt;
• Components of Java Programming language&lt;br&gt;
• What is Java Platform?&lt;br&gt;
• Types of Java Platforms&lt;br&gt;
• How is Java Platform Independent?&lt;br&gt;
• Uses and applications of Java&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is Java?&lt;br&gt;
Java is a high level class based object oriented programming language designed to have just a few implementation dependencies. It is a multi platform and a network centric language. As other programming languages, it is a platform for application development. Java codes can be Compiled to byte codes to run on all platforms supporting java without recompilation. Java is particularly popular for its client-sever web applications with more than 9 million developers under their belt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History of Java Programming Language&lt;br&gt;
Java, originally called oak was developed in the early 1990s by James Gosling and 4 other developers at Sun Microsystems, Inc. (later acquired by oracle in 2009) and released in 1995. At the time, the internet and the WWW were becoming more and more popular but the C and C++ programs used were not platform independent (they had to be compiled and recompiled for different hardware and processors) and required more memory. So the 5 developers sought to create a language that could run on any operating system regardless of the systems hardware or software configuration. The program used for java is small and portable and could be transported over any network. This new development attracted developers in no time because it also allows communication between consumer electronics, making Java the most popular programming languages to this time. Although James Gosling developed java in the early 1990s, he left the company after its acquisition in 2009 by Oracle Corporation to work with Amazon web  services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Features of Java&lt;br&gt;
• Object oriented: Java is a fully object oriented language and possesses features such as encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance, abstraction, class and object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Robust: With features such as automatic Garbage Collection and Exception handling, it helps programmers to create reliable applications which eliminates error prone codes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Simple: The language is easy to learn and the syntax is clean and easily understandable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Security: Java programs run in Java Runtime Environment (JRE) which makes little or no interaction with the Operating System, making the program free from virus attacks because it can’t be invaded from the outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Multi-threading: Java makes use of multi threading features which makes it possible to execute multiple tasks at the same time, resulting in highly interactive and responsive applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• High Performance: Since Java cannot be as fast as C or C++, it makes use of a Java compiler which changes java codes into bytecodes so java applications can run at full speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Independence: Any machine with Java Runtime Environment can run Java programs because all  java programs are compiled into bytecode which is platform Independent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java Architecture&lt;br&gt;
Java Architecture compiles and interprets a program. It explains the process involved in formulating a Java program which includes converting the codes written in java into byte codes, which is done by the Java Compiler. The byte codes are then converted into machine code by the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) which is executed directly by the machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Components of Java&lt;br&gt;
There are three main components of Java language.&lt;br&gt;
• Java Virtual Machine (JVM): This is a component that gives developers an environment to execute Java programs by converting byte codes into machine codes. JVM, first of all, loads the code into memory and verifies it. After that, it executes the code and provides a runtime environment. Hence, JVM performs actions in this order: loads the java codes, verifies them, executes them, and then provides a runtime environment for the codes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Java Runtime Environment (JRE): JRE builds a runtime environment in which Java programs can be executed. It is located on the on-disk system which takes the Java code, combines it with the needed libraries, and starts the JVM to execute it. JRE contains libraries and software that your Java programs need to run. JRE is a part of JDK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Java Development Kit: JDK is a software development environment used to develop Java applications and applets. It contains development tools such as an interpreter/loader (java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (javadoc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java Platforms&lt;br&gt;
A platform is a hardware or software environment in which a program runs. Java has its own run time environment known as JRE(Java Run-time Environment) and Java Virtual Machine(JVM) which converts Java codes to machine codes, making it possible to develop and run the programs that are written in Java Programming language. Java platforms includes execution engine, compiler and set of libraries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Types of Java Platforms&lt;br&gt;
By the late 1990s, Java grew beyond the World Wide Web and as a result, Sun Microsystems created varieties of Java for different purposes, also known as Java editions, such as:&lt;br&gt;
• Java platform Standard Edition: Java Standard Edition is a computing platform that targets work station environments, offering the Java programming language’s core functionality. It is used for the development and deployment of portable codes used in desktop and server environments. It is also used in networking, security, database access, Graphical User Interface (GUI) development, and XML parsing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Java platform Enterprise Edition: is a set of specifications that targets large distributed enterprises or internet environments with features such as distributed computing and web services. The application runs on reference runtimes which handles transactions, security, scalability, concurrency and the management of components to be deployed. Applications of Java Platform Enterprise include e-commerce, accounting, banking information systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Java Platform Micro Edition: This is a computing platform used for the development and deployment of portable codes for embedded and mobile devices like micro-controllers, sensors, gateways, mobile phones, printers, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Java FX: JavaFX is used for creating desktop applications and Rich Internet Applications(RIAs) which can run on a wide variety of devices including desktop computers and web browsers. Its user hardware-accelerated graphics and media engines helps Java take advantage of higher-performance clients and high-level APIs for connecting to networked data sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is Java Platform Independent? &lt;br&gt;
A platform can be called independent if it can run on all available Operating Systems with respect to its development and compilation. Now, Java is platform-independent simply because it produces a unique format called bytecode. First, source code is used by Java compiler and is converted in class file. The class file code is in byte code form and that class file is used by JVM to convert it into an object file. After that, you can see the final output on your screen. Any machine with Java Runtime Environment can run Java Programs. In short, the Java source code can run on all operating systems. Therefore, Java is a platform-Independent language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uses and Applications of Java&lt;br&gt;
• Mobile App development: Java is supported by Android Studio which helps facilitate secure and efficient development for a wide range of mobile applications. It becomes much easier for developers to develop android applications such as Spotify and twitter with the use of Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Game development: Java is often used by game development companies because of its support for the open-source most powerful 3D engine which provides unequalled capacity in designing 3D games. The most popular games developed using Java are Minecraft, Mission Impossible III, etc. Bear in mind that some developers avoid developing games using Java because of its garbage-collection issues, which results in performance problems and frequent pausing in the apps. It is riskier to use Java for the development of bigger AAA games due to this very problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Cloud based Applications: A cloud application is an application that involves data processed on a cloud server. Thanks to factors like top-notch performance, scalability, and reliability, Java has been able to provide the environment to develop cloud-based applications, providing low cost services to its users. There are many types of services that use cloud computing, with the aid of cloud apps like Dropbox, Amazon Web Services, Slack, and Salesforce for storage and file-sharing purposes. Gmail, for instance, is an example of a cloud-based application built with Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• IoT devices: IoT is a technology that connects the devices in its network and communicates with them without human intervention. Combined with technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Java can help power devices remotely, connect appliances and other objects through devices such as health gears, smartphones, wearables, smart lighting, TVs, etc. The IoT is also applied in many industries, including healthcare, security, supply-chain management, and others. IoT programmers gravitate towards Java because it is secure, flexible, and versatile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Web applications: Web application development was one of the first uses of Java and it still remains a first choice language for this because of its security, scalability, and high performance. Due to these factors, many businesses, large and small, turn to Java when they are looking for a quick turnaround for a high-performance web application. Using this technology, users can develop a variety of applications such as LinkedIn, AliExpress, web.archive.org, IRCTC, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Scientific applications: Fields like healthcare and research use Scientific applications frequently to integrate and use math to perform practical, real-world computations, and calculations. Java is often used for creating these apps because they depend on accuracy, reliability, security and not to mention high performance. They can access plenty of support and receive help with troubleshooting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Enterprise Applications: This software is often used for enterprises (large businesses) that need streamlined services delivered in one place because it connects and gives access to various departments and employees. There is also an entire set of Java Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for enterprises called Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) that facilitates efficient and easy scripting. Its platform independence supports company-wide integration and compatibility, making delivery more convenient. Scalability in Java also makes it easier for growing enterprises to keep up with their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• GUI applications: GUI applications can also be developed using Java because it provides frameworks such as AWT, JavaFX, and Swing which enables developers to design, create, test, debug, and deploy Rich Client Applications (RIAs) that behave consistently across multiple platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;br&gt;
At this point, readers should be able to understand the basic concepts of Java such as its definition, architecture, features, components, platforms and its applications. Note that Java is not the same as JavaScript although they are often compared to each other. Java is a programming language that creates applications that run in a virtual machine or a browser while Java Script is a scripting language that runs on a browser only.&lt;br&gt;
These are some of the core upgrades done as a part of Java 8 and 11 release respectively:&lt;br&gt;
Java8;&lt;br&gt;
• Ease of Use&lt;br&gt;
• Increased productivity by providing Optional Classes feature, Lambda Expressions, Streams etc.&lt;br&gt;
• Improved Polyglot programming (performs the same operations in multiple programming languages).&lt;br&gt;
• Improved Security and performance.&lt;br&gt;
Java 11;&lt;br&gt;
• Standardized http client&lt;br&gt;
• Lazy Allocation of Compiler Threads&lt;br&gt;
• Enhanced KeyStore Mechanisms&lt;br&gt;
• Updated Locale Data to Unicode CLDR v33&lt;br&gt;
• JEP 331 Low-Overhead Heap Profiling&lt;br&gt;
• Includes support for Unicode 10.0.0&lt;br&gt;
• JEP 330 Launch Single-File Source-Code Programs&lt;br&gt;
• JEP 181 Nest-Based Access Control&lt;br&gt;
• Added Brainpool EC Support (RFC 5639)&lt;br&gt;
• JEP 332 Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fauna and FQL for Firestore users</title>
      <author>AsyncBanana</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 30 Oct 2021 16:42:22 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/asyncbanana/fauna-and-fql-for-firestore-users-4ch3</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/asyncbanana/fauna-and-fql-for-firestore-users-4ch3</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fauna and Firestore are very similar databases, both offering instant scalability and fairly easy ways of querying, but there are still some key differences. In this article we will look at those differences and how to migrate from Firestore to Fauna and Fauna’s query language (FQL). You might want to migrate because of Fauna’s querying language, flexibility, or multi region capabilities. Even if you don’t know whether you want to migrate yet, this article will provide some information on the differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#background"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Background
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/firestore/"&gt;Firestore&lt;/a&gt; is a database created by Google in 2017. It is the successor to the two previous databases, Firebase Realtime DB and Cloud Datastore. It is grouped within the Firebase category group, offering integration with different Firebase services, although it is also offered through Google Cloud. Firestore’s primary selling points are that it is easy to use, even without a server, and has real-time capabilities. It also offers simple pricing based on reads, data storage, and writes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PSZMbapc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0l74bsdgo3rfv4jkcrvk.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PSZMbapc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0l74bsdgo3rfv4jkcrvk.png" alt="Firestore Logo" width="880" height="271"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://fauna.com"&gt;Fauna&lt;/a&gt; is a database developed in 2012 by a few ex-Twitter engineers to solve scalability problems with existing NoSQL databases. Fauna offers a simple query language called FQL, along with a GraphQL service if you do not want to learn another query language. Fauna also can be used easily without a backend and is focused on doing that while remaining as scalable as possible.&lt;br&gt;
Firestore and Fauna have a number of similar features and a few key differences. They both abstract over cloud machines to provide a simple way of using them and even abstract over cross region replication. They also both offer client side SDK’s and real-time capabilities. Their query languages are a bit different, as Fauna has a more comprehensive setup that allows you to do certain computations on the database through their query language. This can increase speeds by mitigating the need for round trip queries. Firestore’s query language primarily consists of CRUD functions. Another key difference is that Fauna is more flexible with querying capabilities and scalability. Now that you know the background of each database and how they differ, let's go more in depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#comparison"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Comparison
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#query-language"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Query Language
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve highlighted a few differences in the query languages, let’s look more closely at those differences. With Firestore, there are two different styles of querying data, function chaining and data passing via parameters. Before the V9 update, Firestore’s SDK primarily used function chaining. For example, a basic read query might look like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;cities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;SF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The example above accesses the main database object, then the collection and document by chaining the method functions. That is still how it works if you use the server side SDK. However, in a more recent version of the client-side web SDK, there is a way to query by passing options as parameters instead.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getDoc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;collectionName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;documentName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fauna only has one universal SDK and one querying style, which resembles a more powerful version of the Firestore V9 SDK. To perform operations you nest different functions within other functions. For example, to read a document you can do this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Ref&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;collectionName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;documentName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each function is namespaced under &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt;. There are many more than just the ones used in that example. For a full list, you can look at &lt;a href="https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/api/fql/cheat_sheet"&gt;Fauna’s cheat sheet&lt;/a&gt;. Fauna also provides a GraphQL API as mentioned before, but I will not go over that for brevity.&lt;br&gt;
Both query languages are pretty easy to use and you can do most things you need with both, although Fauna’s offers more ways of running things on the database to prevent roundtrips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#indexes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Indexes
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indexes are one place where Firestore and Fauna differ quite a bit. Firestore opts for an approach where it automatically creates indexes for all fields in a document, and allows for querying using those indexes under the hood without worrying about them. For indexes that include multiple fields, you have to manually create a compound query. This approach makes it easy to query but can end up costing the user more, as Firestore creates indexes even when they are not needed, which takes more storage space.&lt;br&gt;
In contrast, Fauna makes you manually create indexes, although it offers an easy to use dashboard and FQL function for creating indexes. Fauna also offers more capabilities for indexes, like cross collection indexes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#transactions-amp-consistency"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Transactions &amp;amp; Consistency
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Firestore and Fauna offer strongly consistent database operations. Fauna uses Calvin, which allows it to replicate data globally with strong consistency. Firestore does not use as advanced of a replication system, although it still does offer strong consistency. The biggest difference for consistent transactions is that as mentioned before, Fauna allows you to do more things on the database directly. This makes it so that you can reduce time when data could change in the process of your server responding to data. So Fauna is definitely better in this case in terms of reliably running consistent transactions out of the box, but both work fairly well in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pricing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Pricing
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pricing for Firestore and Fauna are similar in some ways, but very different in others. They both price by reads, writes, and storage, although Fauna also prices compute operations, which are operations done on their servers. Both offer free tiers, so you can try either without paying anything.&lt;br&gt;
Firestore costs pricing varies based on the region you are using. For a typical single region configuration, Firestore costs $0.36 per million documents read, $1.08 per million documents written to, and $0.108 per gigabyte of storage. For a multi region configuration, Firestore costs $0.6 per million documents read, $1.80 per million documents written to, and $0.18 per gigabyte of storage.&lt;br&gt;
Because Fauna is global by default, it has more consistent pricing, although Fauna multiplies all costs by 1.2x if you are storing all data in Europe and 1.1x if you are storing some in Europe. Fauna costs $0.45 per million documents read, $2.25 per million documents written to, $2.03 per million compute operations, and $0.23 per gigabyte of storage.&lt;br&gt;
As you can see from above, their costs are fairly close. Fauna can be more expensive on the surface level, but it is only sometimes more expensive. This is because Fauna offers features like built in compression and often cheaper querying. Ultimately you will need to do more research based on your own needs to figure out which is cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#limits"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Limits
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both databases have some limits for throughput and size. For Firestore, there are multiple limits on documents. One is that documents must be 1 megabyte or less, and can not be changed more than once per second. Another is that no more than 10,000 write operations can be executed on the database per second, and those write operations cannot collectively contain more than 10 megabytes of data. Also, nested data in document maps have a max depth of 20, although you can get around that by turning it into a JSON string. There are many other limits shown on their Limits page, but those are the most relevant for most people. Fauna also has limits, albeit less. Document sizes are capped at 8 megabytes, transaction sizes are capped at 16 megabytes, and index entries have to stay below 64,000 bytes. For more information, you can look at their Limits page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#comparison-conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Comparison Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fauna and Firestore are very related in many ways, but differ importantly in others. Both are easy to use, although Fauna can be more powerful. If you have previously used Firestore and are interested in Fauna, read on for an intro to FQL (Fauna Query Language) designed for previous Firestore users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#intro-to-fql-from-firestore"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Intro to FQL from Firestore
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you saw in the query language section of the comparison, there can be quite a few differences between the two database's way of querying, especially if you are used to the used to the function chaining Firestore SDK. Luckily, FQL is fairly intuitive, so you should not have much trouble learning it. A basic FQL query is just &lt;code&gt;db.query()&lt;/code&gt; with nothing passed to it. To do things with queries, you pass different functions to the query function, like &lt;code&gt;q.Get&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;q.Create&lt;/code&gt;, and to pass the right information to those operations like what document, you nest functions like &lt;code&gt;q.Ref&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;q.Collection&lt;/code&gt;. This might sound verbose for someone used to someone used to Firestore’s way of just running &lt;code&gt;.get()&lt;/code&gt; on a document, but it can be more elegant, and you can do more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-documents"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating Documents
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fauna offers a function &lt;code&gt;q.Create&lt;/code&gt; that allows for creating documents like Firestore’s &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; function. You simple pass a collection and data and it will return a reference to the new document as well as the new document’s data.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;collectionName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;       
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="na"&gt;field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;fieldValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="na"&gt;fruit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;bananas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;     
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Get reference to result&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ref&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Get new result data&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;The&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;equivalent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Firestore&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;would&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;be&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;addDoc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;collectionName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;fieldValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;fruit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;bananas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Get reference to result&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This works for creating a document without specifying an ID, but you can also update an existing document by using &lt;code&gt;q.Ref&lt;/code&gt; with a collection and id instead of &lt;code&gt;q.Collection&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#getting-documents"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Getting Documents
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is pretty simple to implement if you just are getting a document by ID and collection name.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Ref&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;collectionName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;documentName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;As&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;you&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;can&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;see&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;there&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;contains&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ref&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;passed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;This&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;equivalent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;collectionName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;documentName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;or&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getDoc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;collectionName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;documentName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#settingupdating-documents"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setting/Updating Documents
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fauna offers two built in methods for this, &lt;code&gt;q.Replace&lt;/code&gt; for destructive replacing and &lt;code&gt;q.Update&lt;/code&gt; for updating specific fields without changing the whole document. This equates to the Firestore &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;update&lt;/code&gt; functions.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Ref&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;collectionName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;documentName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;        
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="na"&gt;field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;fieldValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;fruit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;still bananas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Ref&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;collectionName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;documentName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;        
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="na"&gt;fruit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;still bananas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is equivalent to&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// v8 web or Node&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;collectionName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;documentName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;fieldValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;fruit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;still bananas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;collectionName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;documentName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;fruit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;still bananas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// v9 web&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setDoc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;collectionName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;documentName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;fieldValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;fruit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;still bananas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;updateDoc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;collectionName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;documentName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;fruit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;still bananas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Currently if you want to emulate the behavior of set with merge: true which creates a document if it does not exist yet, you can use run a query that checks if a document exists and creates it if it does not using &lt;code&gt;q.If&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#deleting-documents"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Deleting Documents
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deleting a document with Fauna is just like getting a document, but with &lt;code&gt;q.Delete&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;q.Get&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Delete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Ref&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;collectionName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;documentName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;This&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;equates&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// v8 web or node&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;collectionName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;documentName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;delete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// v9 web&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;updateDoc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;collectionName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;documentName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fauna is a great alternative to Firestore with a more powerful query API and other advantages. They are very similar databases, and it is easy to migrate to Fauna from Firestore. I hope this article has enlightened you on the differences between Fauna and Firestore, as well as how FQL code translates to Firestore code, and thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building Internal Tools Using Appsmith, Flask And Heroku</title>
      <author>Curious Paul</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 30 Oct 2021 15:52:26 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/curiouspaul1/building-internal-tools-using-appsmith-flask-and-heroku-ih8</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/curiouspaul1/building-internal-tools-using-appsmith-flask-and-heroku-ih8</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article I will be showing you how to build a simple inventory management tool using Appsmith and Flask, which will serve data to the Appsmith environmennt. You will see how to build and configure a simple backend api using flask as well as how to properly integrate your Appsmith application with the backend api.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#table-of-contents"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Table of Contents
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;Building The Appsmith Application&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;Building And Configuring A Flask Server&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;Integrating Appsmith With Flask&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prerequisites"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Pre-Requisites
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to follow along with this tutorial, you will need to have the following setup:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python3: You wiill need this in order to run the dependencies for the project (including Flask), I am also assuming that you are familiar with python3 and already know how to build simple flask applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appsmith Account: You will also need an Appsmith account in order to build the interface to our tool. If you don't already have one, you can sign up for one via &lt;a href="https://app.appsmith.com/user/signup"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Git and a Github Acount&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#building-and-deploying-a-flask-api"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Building And Deploying A Flask API
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll start by creating a new folder to host our backend application, you can call this whatever you want - mine is called &lt;code&gt;core&lt;/code&gt;. Navigate to this folder from the terminal and create a new file called &lt;code&gt;server.py&lt;/code&gt;, add another file called &lt;code&gt;Procfile&lt;/code&gt; after doing this your project folder should look like the following:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;core/
|__server.py
|__Procfile
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While we're in this folder from the terminal, let's create a new virtual environment using the python package &lt;code&gt;virtualenv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;virtualenv server
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once this is done, activate the virtual environment as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;source &lt;/span&gt;server/bin/activate
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;or if you're on windows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;.&lt;span class="se"&gt;\s&lt;/span&gt;erver&lt;span class="se"&gt;\s&lt;/span&gt;cripts&lt;span class="se"&gt;\a&lt;/span&gt;ctivate
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once you do this you should see your current file path on the terminal prefixed with the name of the virtual environment in parentheses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--crla5kLR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dw0wy0d3bpyg0zrkq2xw.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--crla5kLR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dw0wy0d3bpyg0zrkq2xw.PNG" alt="Image description" width="157" height="48"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now using the pip command install &lt;code&gt;Flask&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Flask-Sqlalchemy&lt;/code&gt;,gunicorn, &lt;code&gt;Flask-CORS&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Flask-Marhsmallow&lt;/code&gt; as shown below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;flask flask-sqlalchemy flask-cors gunicorn flask-marshmallow marshmallow-sqlalchemy
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once they're installed we can start writing our flask server, so open the &lt;code&gt;server.py&lt;/code&gt; file and add the following lines of code:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;flask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Flask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;jsonify&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;flask_sqlalchemy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SQLAlchemy&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;flask_marshmallow&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Marshmallow&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;flask_cors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;CORS&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;basedir&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;abspath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getcwd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# instantiate new flask app
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Flask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# app config for database
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"sqlite:///&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;basedir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;/demo.db"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;CORS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# database models
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SQLAlchemy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;ma&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Marshmallow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Column&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;primary_key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Column&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Column&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ProductSchema&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SQLAlchemyAutoSchema&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'/delete_product'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;methods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'DELETE'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;delete_note&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;force&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# find product
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filter_by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'id'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;delete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;commit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s"&gt;"status"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Success"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s"&gt;"status"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Error"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"__main__"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;create_all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;debug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;code&gt;server&lt;/code&gt; file, we import the required dependencies, create a new flask app instance, added some necessary configurations including "cors" and database config, and specified three endpoints to which we can send requests. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Save this file and run the script from the terminal using the following command:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;python server.py
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You should see the server start running with logs similar to these :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--h7APuyN2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5we0377e5f426vpcscet.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--h7APuyN2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5we0377e5f426vpcscet.PNG" alt="Image description" width="697" height="158"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#deploying-to-heroku"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;u&gt;Deploying To Heroku&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is great but in order for our server to be publicly accessible we must deploy it to a cloud service provider, and for that we would be using &lt;code&gt;Heroku&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heroku is a PaaS cloud service provider that helps us to deploy application really easily without having to worry about the kind of machine to provision for the software and how to scale them - Heroku does all that on our behalf, all we have to do is tell them howto run our application, and we do that using the &lt;code&gt;Procfile&lt;/code&gt; that we creatd earlier on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this you will need to have an account with Heroku, you can easily create one from &lt;a href="https://signup.heroku.com/"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;. Once you do download the &lt;code&gt;heroku cli&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have the cli tool installed, open up a new terminal and navigate to the project directory, and first you need to login using :&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;heroku login
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This would prompt you to open your browser and log you in from there, by the time its done you should be logged in frm the terminal as well, you can now creat a new heroku app as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;heroku create appsmith-server
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I called mine &lt;code&gt;appsmith-server&lt;/code&gt;, you can give yours any name as well, since Heroku doesn't allow shared names so you might have to come up with a much cooler name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that our heroku application has been created, let's tell heroku what to run in the &lt;code&gt;Procfile&lt;/code&gt;, so open the &lt;code&gt;Procfile&lt;/code&gt; and add the following to it:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;web: python gunicorn:app
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Procfile&lt;/code&gt; deployment specification follows the format of&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;[process_type]: [command]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Likewise, I have specified that the &lt;code&gt;"process_type"&lt;/code&gt; be of type &lt;code&gt;"web"&lt;/code&gt;, meaning the application to be deployed is a web application. The &lt;code&gt;"command"&lt;/code&gt; to run the application has also been specified (its supposed to run the flask server using gunicorn). What this means is that when Heroku wants to spin up an instance of our application it looks at the &lt;code&gt;Procfile&lt;/code&gt; and uses the instructions there to run the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we finally deploy we need to tell Heroku, of the things it needs to install before running the application, and this is done using the &lt;code&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;br&gt;
which Heroku will automatically look for during deloyment. We can easily append the requirements from our virtual environment using pip as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip freeze&amp;gt;requirements.txt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This wll automatically take all the installed dependencies and add them to a file called &lt;code&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt;, so you should find that it created a new file for you by that name that has the following contents, or at least similar contents:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;8.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;colorama&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Flask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Flask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Cors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;3.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Flask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SQLAlchemy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;greenlet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;itsdangerous&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Jinja2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;3.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;MarkupSafe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;six&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;SQLAlchemy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Werkzeug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To deploy the application, we'll be using &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;, so head back to the terminal ad initialize a git repository in the project folder using the &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; command, and then &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;commit&lt;/code&gt; the changes to version control history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we will add a remote origin for the heroku application, so that we can push and in effect deploy the application from the terminal using git.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;heroku git:remote -a &amp;lt;Your-heroku-app-name&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This will create a private repository on heroku that your updates will be pushed to when you push to heroku. Now we can finally deploy our application by pushing the committed code as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git push heroku main
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This would begin the deployment opertaion with logs similar to these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RTDo4ZAz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4ua9cwq2u6uu9manoqvz.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RTDo4ZAz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4ua9cwq2u6uu9manoqvz.PNG" alt="Image description" width="880" height="405"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once its done it should give you a link to the application instance, this link is usually of the format: &lt;code&gt;(your-app-name).herokuapp.com&lt;/code&gt;. Copy this link and paste it in a browser, and add any of the url prefix for any of the endpoints on the serer like &lt;code&gt;/add_product&lt;/code&gt; for example&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9R7LGeyg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/t6mgc1ptgivswnwavpvt.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9R7LGeyg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/t6mgc1ptgivswnwavpvt.PNG" alt="Image description" width="846" height="398"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see that the request goes through, and this is sign that the server is up and running and is accessible publicly. Let's head over to appsmith and build the interface for this tool.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#building-the-management-tool-using-appsmith"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Building The Management Tool Using Appsmith
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin with you want to login to your Appsmith dashboard and create a new application, this should bring you to the development environment like the one shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JDmyCJQN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ia8eg8i1znyuh51d9ilf.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JDmyCJQN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ia8eg8i1znyuh51d9ilf.PNG" alt="Image description" width="880" height="423"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This environment is where we'd be building our "application" and its mostly a drag and drop environment with widgets and other build tools on the left pane and the wider space to the right is the development area where you drag widgets on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll start by clicking and dragging a &lt;code&gt;table&lt;/code&gt; widget unto the right area, this table will display a business's  product inventory, and the details of each one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XBnXDTyz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1kyf95nqtncpq3b6tkjy.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XBnXDTyz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1kyf95nqtncpq3b6tkjy.PNG" alt="Image description" width="880" height="464"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resize the table by dragging on the edges, however leave some space so that we can add one more widget - a form. This form will collect information for a new product to be added to the list and will also serve as a means of editing already existing products in the catalogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click and drag the form widget onto the right area so that it fits to the right of the table as shown below, you may need to do some resizing to get it to fit in there:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IbXu083C--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ezpa2bid4z4e65x5x3b5.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IbXu083C--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ezpa2bid4z4e65x5x3b5.PNG" alt="Image description" width="880" height="410"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#building-the-form"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;u&gt;Building The Form&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a form, we'll need the &lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Input&lt;/code&gt; widgets which will help us to name and create the input fields for the form. For this form we need fields that will hold details of each product including the &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;description&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;price&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;quantity&lt;/code&gt;. So drag text labels and input widgets for each field, as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vbADsK1K--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hdw61ij0rqmpktz22zd7.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vbADsK1K--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hdw61ij0rqmpktz22zd7.PNG" alt="Image description" width="605" height="458"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also rename the buttons on the form to be &lt;code&gt;Add new&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Update&lt;/code&gt;, as they will serve to create new products and update existing ones&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#fetching-data-from-the-api"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;u&gt;Fetching Data From The API&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's try to create a new product using the form we created earlier on. So head back to the appsmith dashbord and under the &lt;code&gt;Datasources&lt;/code&gt; section click on the &lt;code&gt;create new API&lt;/code&gt; option to add a new API to communicate with from your appsmnith application&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PffQ5Ock--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/v1/../appsmith%2Bfauna/demo_images/demo8.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PffQ5Ock--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/v1/../appsmith%2Bfauna/demo_images/demo8.png" alt="" width="" height=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should prompt you to enter details about your api on a new page, these includes a name for the API (I called mine "AddProduct"), the URL, headers and data or request body to be sent to the Api. Fill the details as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DaMPo7F_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jw50vqkzh20kul2ygl5w.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DaMPo7F_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jw50vqkzh20kul2ygl5w.PNG" alt="Image description" width="880" height="483"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we have added the url to our heroku deployment and added the endpoint &lt;code&gt;add_product&lt;/code&gt; that sends a POST request to add a new product to the database. In the body  add the following to create a payload that contains data from the form.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Input1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Input2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Input3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;quantity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Input4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#add-a-new-product"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;u&gt;Add A New Product&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's now tie this with the &lt;code&gt;Add new&lt;/code&gt; button so that when we edit the form and click &lt;code&gt;Add new&lt;/code&gt; the this api is called. Head over to the &lt;code&gt;Add new&lt;/code&gt; widget and bring up the settings pane, and under the &lt;code&gt;Actions&lt;/code&gt; section choose the &lt;code&gt;onClick&lt;/code&gt; option, and choose the option to &lt;code&gt;Execute a query&lt;/code&gt; and then select the &lt;code&gt;AddProduct&lt;/code&gt; api from the list of options showed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SKnU8O6C--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/eqstgh571e62eh9un5bu.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SKnU8O6C--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/eqstgh571e62eh9un5bu.PNG" alt="Image description" width="250" height="207"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next to this &lt;code&gt;onClick&lt;/code&gt; action is the &lt;code&gt;onSuccess&lt;/code&gt; option, and this will trigger on success of the request sent when the button is clicked. We want the table to be updated when we add a new product from the form, so we will create a new api to fill the table with data from the database, and then call that api whenever we add a new product from the form as the &lt;code&gt;onSuccess&lt;/code&gt; action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this will do is to refresh the table each time we add a new product to the database. So head over to the datasources and create a new API called &lt;code&gt;getProducts&lt;/code&gt; that sends a GET request to the server endpoint of &lt;code&gt;get_products&lt;/code&gt; as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Ll3zGsoR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nge0bxgz1rn3ua996kop.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Ll3zGsoR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nge0bxgz1rn3ua996kop.PNG" alt="Image description" width="496" height="124"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Head back to the &lt;code&gt;onSuccess&lt;/code&gt; action of the &lt;code&gt;Add new&lt;/code&gt; button from earlier and choose the option to &lt;code&gt;Execute a query&lt;/code&gt; and then select the &lt;code&gt;getProducts&lt;/code&gt; api from the list of options showed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2u3_iyKO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sbrwh2jkmwpbkzdacaw1.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2u3_iyKO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sbrwh2jkmwpbkzdacaw1.PNG" alt="Image description" width="207" height="203"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now head to the table widget and we'll ask the table to fetch data from this api instead of the hard-coded data in it. Click on the table widget and its context manager should pop-up right beside it, and under the field that reads - &lt;code&gt;Table Data&lt;/code&gt;, you want to clear out the hard-coded data in it and add the following instead:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getProducts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You should see the data show up on the table, we can now add a new product from the form and then when we click the &lt;code&gt;Add new&lt;/code&gt; button on the form the new data should create a new row in the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#edit-a-product"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;u&gt;Edit A Product&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also want to be able to prefill the form fields when any product is selected on the table so that we can edit them on the form. To do this we leverage on the &lt;code&gt;Default value&lt;/code&gt; property of the input widget and add moustache syntax to fetch data on the selected row and add it to the field. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the following to the &lt;code&gt;Default value&lt;/code&gt; entry on the &lt;code&gt;Name&lt;/code&gt; field to prefill it with the name of the product on a selected row.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Table1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;selectedRow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you don't see the details of the input widget, click on the settings icon beside it to bring up the properties of the widegt, as shown below&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UFYwXJ7h--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/txno4hc2n0uvznb2dkt3.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UFYwXJ7h--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/txno4hc2n0uvznb2dkt3.PNG" alt="Image description" width="272" height="466"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do this for the other fields adding in the corresponding column name for each one. Also set the &lt;code&gt;Data type&lt;/code&gt; property for the input fields: &lt;code&gt;quantity&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;price&lt;/code&gt; to type of &lt;code&gt;Number&lt;/code&gt;. This way we can edit any product by clicking on it making the changes in the form and then use the &lt;code&gt;Update&lt;/code&gt; button on the form to submit the edit to the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's create a new API to handle the product update, so as before create a new api and name it &lt;code&gt;updateProduct&lt;/code&gt;, that sends a &lt;code&gt;PUT&lt;/code&gt; request to the server on the &lt;code&gt;/edit_product&lt;/code&gt; endpoint. Add the following to the body of the request:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Table1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;selectedRow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Input1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Input2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Input3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;quantity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Input4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now link this to the &lt;code&gt;update&lt;/code&gt; button just like we did for the &lt;code&gt;Add new&lt;/code&gt; button as an &lt;code&gt;onClick&lt;/code&gt; action, also specify the &lt;code&gt;getProducts&lt;/code&gt; api as an &lt;code&gt;onSuccess&lt;/code&gt; action so that the table reloads the data. Now we can click on any row and edit a product from the form and it'll be automatically updated on the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#delete-a-product"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;u&gt;Delete A Product&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to delete a product we can add a third button widget to the form, create a &lt;code&gt;deleteProduct&lt;/code&gt; api that sends a &lt;code&gt;DELETE&lt;/code&gt; request to the server on the &lt;code&gt;/delete_product&lt;/code&gt; endpoint, with a payload defined as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Table1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;selectedRow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tie this to the new &lt;code&gt;delete&lt;/code&gt; button and add an &lt;code&gt;onSuccess&lt;/code&gt; action to call the &lt;code&gt;getProducts&lt;/code&gt; api once again like before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have come quite a long way, now haven't we?. In this article, we have seen how to build and deploy a server using flask and heroku, we worked with Appsmith to build a simple product inventory management tool for business owners, and connected it to our API. There's more that we could possibly accomplish using Appsmith and a traditional web server, for example we could embed the appsmith tool we built directly on a web page and serve the web page on our flask server.&lt;br&gt;
That is just one of the many possibilities with Appsmith and I'm hoping this article has further shown you what is possible with serverless technologies like Appsmith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for sticking with me till the end, happy coding!. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="#who-am-i-and-why-did-i-participate"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Who am I and why did I participate
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined Dev.to to read blogs, post blogs and learn new things. I mainly wanted to join hacktoberfest because I really wanted to plant a tree. #TeamTrees&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#background"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Background
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was just a average kid in school about a year ago. Now, I learnt that coding gives me happiness and is a really good excuse for coffee too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#progress"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Progress
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My progress went a lil' terrible. I had my exams so, I was always studying. Then, on 27th and 28th there was Github universe which I had enrolled in. I had to attend so many sessions that I didn't get sleep at all. Then, on 29th and 30th, also I was awake the whole night. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#contributions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Contributions
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I contributed to 5 repos. 2 were related to blockchain, 2 were related to web design and the last one was a list of things todo list.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Next.Js Series #7 - Deploying the Web Page to Vercel for FREE (from Github repo)</title>
      <author>Dylan Oh</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 30 Oct 2021 14:46:06 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/ohdylan/nextjs-series-7-deploying-the-web-page-to-vercel-for-free-from-github-repo-1mob</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/ohdylan/nextjs-series-7-deploying-the-web-page-to-vercel-for-free-from-github-repo-1mob</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are going to demonstrate how easy it is to deploy your static web app to Vercel for free in the last article of the series. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, commit and push the project to a Github repo if you haven't. Go to &lt;a href="https://vercel.com/login"&gt;https://vercel.com/login&lt;/a&gt;, create a Vercel account with Github account authorization. You will now see an empty dashboard (if you have not deployed anything to Vercel before).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fwcelj-X--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2nz8wm81quw8p2iesqvl.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fwcelj-X--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2nz8wm81quw8p2iesqvl.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="523"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click "Create a New Project".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--b-V6azqL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7ftbfdi93em917wcw4v5.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--b-V6azqL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7ftbfdi93em917wcw4v5.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="619"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose a Github account, and Github window will pop up for you to select the project that you want to deploy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6RZPdOay--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ecp3zsvjzruelwggyu0w.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6RZPdOay--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ecp3zsvjzruelwggyu0w.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="649"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Type and select the repo that you commited your project to install Vercel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will now see that the Github repo is ready to be imported. Click on "Import".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_hyPtAXJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/df20guu5hbl3pphzn0ni.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_hyPtAXJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/df20guu5hbl3pphzn0ni.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="605"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can skip all the customisable configurations for our demo project. Click on "Deploy".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--U42wpRda--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/iri6q1b6gseyfuze1e9s.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--U42wpRda--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/iri6q1b6gseyfuze1e9s.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="636"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may see that the app is being deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CWyA5T0H--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fddh7dirrlsnx6xl3ix2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CWyA5T0H--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fddh7dirrlsnx6xl3ix2.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="530"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you see this page, it means the deployment has been successful. Click on "Go to Dashboard".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Select the app that we have deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UnD-eJA4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/erxtj6b1wjbpxyqsnvpc.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UnD-eJA4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/erxtj6b1wjbpxyqsnvpc.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="360"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see that now the app is live and running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3WsMXdB0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3xtyohx7rweab81marzh.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3WsMXdB0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3xtyohx7rweab81marzh.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="417"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may test on different routes to see if they are working properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--I1DEf2cX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2koyt8lgu30q82a4jd9e.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--I1DEf2cX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2koyt8lgu30q82a4jd9e.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="561"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I might consider to add one more article on the topic for Next.Js Analytics by Vercel to this series. It has a great dashboard and tracking some metrics that we mentioned in series #6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for following through this short series of brief introduction to Next.Js. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I shall continue to post more Web Dev, UIUX related articles (and more non-technical articles) in the future. Stay tune!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>7 Nice API for your projects !</title>
      <author>CodeOz</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 30 Oct 2021 14:41:31 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/codeoz/7-nice-api-for-your-projects--3ap</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/codeoz/7-nice-api-for-your-projects--3ap</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;API&lt;/strong&gt; is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I will share with you some nice API to use for your projects!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#movie-database-imdb"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🍿 Movie database (IMDB)
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction"&gt;https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need informations about movies, series, etc... You can use IMDB API that is very easy to use!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#food-recipes-spoonacular"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🥄 Food Recipes (spoonacular)
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs"&gt;https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you looking for recipes? Soonacular is a great api that will provide you some recipes for your next project!! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#rick-amp-morty-database"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  👽 Rick &amp;amp; Morty database
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/"&gt;https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rick and Morty API is based on the television show Rick and Morty. You will have access to about hundreds of characters, images, locations and episodes !!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#random-advice"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🩲 Random Advice
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://api.adviceslip.com/#top"&gt;https://api.adviceslip.com/#top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very fast api to use! It will provide you some random advice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can test it right now from this url &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://api.adviceslip.com/advice"&gt;https://api.adviceslip.com/advice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#fake-user"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🥸 Fake User
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://randomuser.me/?ref=undesign"&gt;https://randomuser.me/?ref=undesign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you need fake user for your website? This API will give you a list of fake user!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#user-icons-dicebear"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🤡 User icons (DiceBear)
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://avatars.dicebear.com/docs/http-api#options"&gt;https://avatars.dicebear.com/docs/http-api#options&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DiceBear is an avatar library for designers and developers. You can test it fastly at this url for example: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/male/john.svg?background=%230000ff"&gt;https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/male/john.svg?background=%230000ff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cats-fact"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🐱 Cats fact
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://alexwohlbruck.github.io/cat-facts/"&gt;https://alexwohlbruck.github.io/cat-facts/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This app will combine APIs and Services from the web to do just one thing… send cat facts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building a Map Application with Amazon Location Service, Leaflet, AWS Amplify, and Vue.js</title>
      <author>Yasunori Kirimoto</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 30 Oct 2021 14:41:19 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/aws-builders/building-a-map-application-with-amazon-location-service-leaflet-aws-amplify-and-vuejs-2l6e</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/aws-builders/building-a-map-application-with-amazon-location-service-leaflet-aws-amplify-and-vuejs-2l6e</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--q4raMIFc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://day-journal.com/memo/images/try-061_12.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--q4raMIFc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://day-journal.com/memo/images/try-061_12.png" alt="img" width="880" height="136"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#i-built-a-map-application-using-amazon-location-service-leaflet-aws-amplify-and-vuejs-tada"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  I built a map application using Amazon Location Service, Leaflet, AWS Amplify, and Vue.js 🎉
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon Location Service is a service for building location-based applications within AWS. At present, five types of functions are available: map display function, address search function, route search function, geofence function, and tracking function. This time, I used the map display function to build a map application!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Advance Preparation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up AWS Amplify and Vue.js to the login feature

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#configure-amazon-location-maps"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Configure Amazon Location Maps
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we will configure Amazon Location Maps in the AWS console.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Click on "Maps".&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hVEt2WAK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://day-journal.com/memo/images/try-061_01.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hVEt2WAK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://day-journal.com/memo/images/try-061_01.png" alt="img" width="880" height="683"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on "Create map".&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6OcCiQ3I--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://day-journal.com/memo/images/try-061_02.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6OcCiQ3I--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://day-journal.com/memo/images/try-061_02.png" alt="img" width="880" height="684"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter a map name and select a map. This time, select "sample."&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--896RowoC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://day-journal.com/memo/images/try-061_03.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--896RowoC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://day-journal.com/memo/images/try-061_03.png" alt="img" width="880" height="1544"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on the map that has been created.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BQEpZQuZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://day-journal.com/memo/images/try-061_04.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BQEpZQuZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://day-journal.com/memo/images/try-061_04.png" alt="img" width="880" height="684"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copy the "Name" and "ARN" shown here to use them in future settings.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kiN29o92--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://day-journal.com/memo/images/try-061_05.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kiN29o92--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://day-journal.com/memo/images/try-061_05.png" alt="img" width="880" height="683"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will complete the setup of Amazon Location Maps 👍 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#frontend"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Frontend
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, let's build the actual map application.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once Amplify and Vue.js are configured, it's just a matter of adding a new "MapPane.vue" and changing some of the code.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;execution environment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;node v16.3.0
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;npm v7.15.1
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Install the Leaflet package in advance. Also, install the Mapbox GL Leaflet package and the OSS version of the Mapbox GL JS package to display the vector tiles.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;leaflet
npm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;mapbox-gl-leaflet
npm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;mapbox-gl@1.13.0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Overall composition&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Wxp-qBRa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://day-journal.com/memo/images/try-061_06.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Wxp-qBRa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://day-journal.com/memo/images/try-061_06.png" alt="img" width="258" height="570"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#packagejson"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  package.json
&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"amazon-location-app"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"version"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"0.1.0"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"private"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"scripts"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"serve"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"vue-cli-service serve"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"build"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"vue-cli-service build"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"lint"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"vue-cli-service lint"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"dependencies"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"@aws-amplify/ui-vue"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"^1.0.12"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"aws-amplify"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"^4.1.1"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;35.681&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;139.767&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;zoomControl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;layers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sample&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Map_BaseLayer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;sample&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sample&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;layers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Map_BaseLayer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Configure the settings to load Amazon Location Maps.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;transformRequest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;resourceType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resourceType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;includes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;://&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`https://maps.geo.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;awsconfig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;aws_project_region&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.amazonaws.com/maps/v0/maps/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/style-descriptor`&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;includes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;amazonaws.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Signer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;signUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="na"&gt;access_key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;credentials&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;accessKeyId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="na"&gt;secret_key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;credentials&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;secretAccessKey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="na"&gt;session_token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;credentials&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sessionToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#configure-amplify-roles"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Configure Amplify Roles
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last step is to add the Amazon Location Maps policy to the Amplify role.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Search for the role that is used for the login function. Select "amplify-xxxxx-authRole".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---y7Y3uec--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://day-journal.com/memo/images/try-061_07.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---y7Y3uec--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://day-journal.com/memo/images/try-061_07.png" alt="img" width="880" height="684"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click "Add Inline Policy".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--aW2I1ojS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://day-journal.com/memo/images/try-061_08.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--aW2I1ojS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://day-journal.com/memo/images/try-061_08.png" alt="img" width="880" height="679"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Select "JSON" to set the policy. Set the "ARN" of the created map to "Resource."&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"Version"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"2012-10-17"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"Statement"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"Sid"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"MapsReadOnly"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"Effect"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Allow"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"Action"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"geo:GetMapStyleDescriptor"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"geo:GetMapGlyphs"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"geo:GetMapSprites"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"geo:GetMapTile"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"Resource"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"arn:aws:geo:us-west-2:xxxxx:map/sample"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lERdbLCn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://day-journal.com/memo/images/try-061_09.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lERdbLCn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://day-journal.com/memo/images/try-061_09.png" alt="img" width="880" height="681"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set the name as needed. This time, set it as "amazon-location-maps."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gcUJ-iO3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://day-journal.com/memo/images/try-061_10.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gcUJ-iO3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://day-journal.com/memo/images/try-061_10.png" alt="img" width="880" height="682"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure that the policy has been created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nS6MC7Lt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://day-journal.com/memo/images/try-061_11.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nS6MC7Lt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://day-journal.com/memo/images/try-061_11.png" alt="img" width="880" height="681"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This completes the role configuration for Amplify 👍 &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's check with a simple local server.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm run serve
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Startup a local server and try logging in. You are now able to see Amazon Location Maps 💡 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--d7VPWd-8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://day-journal.com/memo/images/try-061_00.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--d7VPWd-8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://day-journal.com/memo/images/try-061_00.gif" alt="img" width="880" height="779"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#i-was-able-to-build-a-map-application-using-a-combination-of-amazon-location-service-leaflet-aws-amplify-and-vuejs-thumbsup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  I was able to build a map application using a combination of Amazon Location Service, Leaflet, AWS Amplify, and Vue.js 👍
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I installed Amplify in advance, I was able to build Amazon Location Service quickly. However, some areas can still be improved, such as the need for separate role settings and the limited styles that can be selected. I'll continue to explore other features as well 👍 &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CSS Positions</title>
      <author>Avinash Gupta</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 30 Oct 2021 14:22:53 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/tier3guy/css-positions-2p0l</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/tier3guy/css-positions-2p0l</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am as a beginner faced a lot of difficulty in understanding the &lt;code&gt;Position&lt;/code&gt; property in CSS. Today in this doc I will be explaining Positions in a very friendly and easy manner. So, lets begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is &lt;code&gt;position&lt;/code&gt; property?&lt;br&gt;
As the name suggest Position is a property in CSS to set the position of an element.&lt;br&gt;
It has 5 values and they are :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;relative&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;fixed&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;absolute&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;sticky&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;now again a question arises that is why should we use this is position property?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the answer is that, after specifying the position property you can use four more properties i.e &lt;code&gt;top&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;bottom&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;left&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;right&lt;/code&gt;, which will again help you better to shape your elements to enhance your frontend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: you cannot use these four properties (top, bottom, left, right) directly before specifying the position property. Using them directly without specifying position will be of no use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we know that what is position property and why should we use it. Now lets quickly jump to those five values and try to better understand them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;position: static;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;now, static is the default position property, it positions your element according to regular flow of the dom.&lt;br&gt;
(Note: top, bottom, left, and right won't work with static)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you know why without defining position property you cannot use top, bottom, left and right. (As if you have not defined the position, the browser will set it to static (default behavior) and top, bottom, left, right won't work with static)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gist: static is the default behavior of the browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;relative&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;position: relative;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;relative works relative to the normal position of the element.&lt;br&gt;
I know you didn't understand. Lets take up an example.&lt;br&gt;
Suppose you created a div and set its width and height. Now,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;position: relative;
left: 50px;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;after applying these two lines in the css of your div, you will find that your div is shifted by 50px from its left. Now this is what means relative to the normal position. Once again, if you apply&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;top: 100px;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;you will see that your div shifted by 100px from its top.&lt;br&gt;
I hope now you get the clear idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;fixed&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;position: fixed;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Fixed and relative and totally similar, but the only difference is that the relative position the elements from its normal position while fixed sets the position in relative to the browser window.&lt;br&gt;
Eg.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;position: fixed;
left: 5px;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;after applying this css your div will move to a distance of 5px from the left of your browser window.&lt;br&gt;
and the important thing is that it won't scroll with your webpage. It will get fixed to that position. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But suppose you want to fix the position with respective to browser window but at same time you want your div to get scroll with your page. How do you do this, as if you will apply position fixed property it won't allow your div to get scroll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, here comes the concept of position: absolute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;absolute&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;position: absolute;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are two difference between absolute and fixed.&lt;br&gt;
a. The first one is fixed doesn't allow scroll but absolute does.&lt;br&gt;
b. And the second one is absolute works with the nearest &lt;strong&gt;positioned&lt;/strong&gt; ancestor. Means that fixed sets your element with the respect to the dom window, while absolute sets your div to the nearest ancestor(parent) element who has its position set. But what if there is not parent element with position property, then it will set your according to dom as like fixed but it will still allow scroll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sticky&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;position: sticky;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;sticky is same is fixed the only difference is it sets the property when ever the element gets out of the window on scrolling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this was all about the position property. Hope you get some knowledge after reading this doc. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Powerful extensions for Rails developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby is built with developer happiness in mind. However, if your editor is not correctly set up, you’re in for a painful ride. Finding the right extensions on VS Code can take you down a long trial-and-error path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a list of powerful extensions for Ruby on Rails developers.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ruby"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Ruby
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ruby&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ruby Solargraph&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Endwise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ERB Helper tags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rails DB Schema&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rubocop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ERB Formatter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emmet in ERB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#general"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  General
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Atom Dark Theme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VSCode-icons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DotENV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output Colorizer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Auto Rename Tag&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highlight Matching Tag&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bracket Pair Colorizer 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ruby"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Ruby
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-ruby"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Ruby
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This speaks for itself. Ruby syntax highlighting.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_HWChfms--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8q4lygi5mdfjki0hd8q5.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_HWChfms--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8q4lygi5mdfjki0hd8q5.png" alt="Ruby" width="880" height="206"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-ruby-solargraph"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Ruby Solargraph
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intelligent code completion and documentation while you’re writing code.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--W7y6CpDa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i8q3rqoq8d68w68j1h45.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--W7y6CpDa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i8q3rqoq8d68w68j1h45.png" alt="solargraph png" width="880" height="201"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kIY3T5Dk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xv2jtj6g5yprvszj8iq8.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kIY3T5Dk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xv2jtj6g5yprvszj8iq8.gif" alt="solargraph gif" width="500" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-endwise"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Endwise
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be wise and never forget to close the end immediately.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8RuYMokk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wusndxql5s5cw2rhdjcv.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8RuYMokk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wusndxql5s5cw2rhdjcv.png" alt="Endwise png" width="880" height="190"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ydBihamO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/y6n67ldilikoocbo0ny2.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ydBihamO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/y6n67ldilikoocbo0ny2.gif" alt="Endwise gif" width="729" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-erb-helper-tags"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. ERB Helper Tags
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Useful shortcuts to save you time.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zMUaynEV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qifqvtcy9ht9nwkz2a20.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zMUaynEV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qifqvtcy9ht9nwkz2a20.png" alt="erb 1" width="880" height="187"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Cf-xeyGP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r6jm13xl56xqvusmaw0d.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Cf-xeyGP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r6jm13xl56xqvusmaw0d.png" alt="erb 2" width="880" height="999"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-rails-db-schema"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Rails DB Schema
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get quick insight on the defined database schema while you’re typing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Yiz0l81f--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/p3e3cssb2fjtt82bvxkv.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Yiz0l81f--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/p3e3cssb2fjtt82bvxkv.png" alt="schema png" width="880" height="220"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VrJsN2Wr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jctb1v175vjbkg0uc1f4.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VrJsN2Wr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jctb1v175vjbkg0uc1f4.gif" alt="schema gif" width="880" height="324"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-rubocop"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. Rubocop
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code formatter for writing Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uZsDYRXn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3yy3e1p609satctuy33e.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uZsDYRXn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3yy3e1p609satctuy33e.png" alt="rubocop" width="880" height="197"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re running into the following error, follow &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53367947/rubocop-on-vscode-not-working-error-rubocop-is-not-executable/53367974"&gt;this guide&lt;/a&gt; to link the right execution path:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;rubocop is not excutable 
execute path is empty!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#7-erb-formatterbeautify"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  7. ERB Formatter/Beautify
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not being able to indent your html.erb files in VS Code can be a real pain. ERB Formatter depends on the htmlbeautifier gem, so we need to install that dependency too: &lt;code&gt;gem install htmlbeautifier&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lHsTXZFn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lr1zsa9ww05emwxvhg5h.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lHsTXZFn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lr1zsa9ww05emwxvhg5h.png" alt="Erb formatter" width="880" height="205"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"files.associations"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"*.erb"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"erb"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"[erb]"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"editor.defaultFormatter"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"aliariff.vscode-erb-beautify"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"[html]"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"editor.defaultFormatter"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"aliariff.vscode-erb-beautify"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"files.associations"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"*.erb"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"erb"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#8-emmet-in-erb"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  8. Emmet in ERB
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not an extension, yet it’s something you really want. If you’re writing &lt;strong&gt;html.erb&lt;/strong&gt; files, you want to have access to the available emmet in HTML. It requires this setup:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"emmet.includeLanguages"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"erb"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"html"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"emmet.showAbbreviationSuggestions"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"emmet.showSuggestionsAsSnippets"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;






&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#general"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  General
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-atom-one-dark-theme"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Atom One Dark Theme
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VR6aMtXn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4nu2o65mm8gxa9lpcype.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VR6aMtXn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4nu2o65mm8gxa9lpcype.png" alt="atom png" width="880" height="163"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theme of your editor is a personal choice. Choose what’s pleasant to your eyes and provides useful syntax highlighting. Alternatively, check Material Theme.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-vs-code-icons"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. VS Code — Icons
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beautiful icons make it easy to distinguish between folder and file types.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--b8fbZn1j--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0wnvj3tmt26bmo9yiddo.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--b8fbZn1j--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0wnvj3tmt26bmo9yiddo.png" alt="icons" width="778" height="452"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--U1yTzFpr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ut5xqgbqalf785soo4ut.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--U1yTzFpr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ut5xqgbqalf785soo4ut.png" alt="icon example" width="880" height="194"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-dotenv"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. DotENV
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syntax highlighting for your &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FdWM-P6w--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ik9s01l1doys3kgr5cdj.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FdWM-P6w--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ik9s01l1doys3kgr5cdj.png" alt="Env" width="880" height="263"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AE5uv8oV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/afc8rcto8xfxyynxlhqr.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AE5uv8oV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/afc8rcto8xfxyynxlhqr.png" alt="Env example" width="880" height="180"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-output-colorizer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Output Colorizer
&lt;/h3&gt;

  5. Auto Rename Tag
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Save yourself 50% of the time spent selecting closing tags.&lt;br&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. Highlight Matching Tag
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spot opening and closing tags immediately. I’ve also added some optional custom config to highlight both the left and right chevron (&amp;lt; …. &amp;gt;) when selecting a tag.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript syntax highlighting and formatting are extensively covered in VS Code. Depending on the framework you use, you might want to add other extensions too.&lt;/p&gt;
