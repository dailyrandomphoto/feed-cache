      <guid>https://dev.to/aws-builders/tensorflow-and-pytorch-on-graviton2-using-anaconda-5hd5</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.anaconda.com"&gt;Anaconda&lt;/a&gt; advertises 25 million users worldwide and offers an easy way to perform machine learning on a single machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until recently, it has been difficult to install TensorFlow and PyTorch on Arm machines, including Graviton. There are numerous articles outlining difficult installation methods, most of which involve building source code. As the Arm software ecosystem continues to improve, more and more software just works on Arm. One of the latest improvements is Anaconda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, let’s see how to get started with two popular machine learning frameworks, &lt;a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/"&gt;TensorFlow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pytorch.org/"&gt;PyTorch&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/"&gt;Graviton&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setup-a-graviton2-ec2-instance"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setup a Graviton2 EC2 instance
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, create a new EC2 instance. The instance can be any of the instance types powered by Graviton processors including A1, T4g, M6g, C6g, or R6g. There are numerous &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html"&gt;AWS tutorials&lt;/a&gt; about how to create an AWS account and use the AWS Console to configure and launch a new EC2 instance. Make sure to substitute one of the above instance types in any tutorial you use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The t4g.micro instances are free (up to 750 hours per month) until December 31, 2021. With 2 vCPUs and 1 GiB memory, the t4g.micro won't provide enough performance for machine learning projects, but does work to try out the steps in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this example, I created a t4g.medium running Ubuntu 20.04 with a public IP address and accessible from my desktop via ssh. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find the public IP address of the EC2 instance in the AWS console and connect.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh -i mykey.pem ubuntu@&amp;lt;ec2-ip-address&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once connected, update the software, install Anaconda, and source the bash environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Anaconda install script will review the license agreement and ask to accept the terms. Then accept the default installation directory of $HOME/anconda3.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo apt update ; sudo apt upgrade -y 
$ wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2021.05-Linux-aarch64.sh
$ sh ./Anaconda3-2021.05-Linux-aarch64.sh
$ . ~/.bashrc

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The default conda environment is named base and this will be shown in the shell prompt.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;(base) ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-251:~$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#install-tensorflow"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Install TensorFlow
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a new conda environment named tf, install TensorFlow, and activate the new environment.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ conda create -n tf tensorflow
$ conda activate tf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The shell prompt will now show the tf environment.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;(tf) ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-251:~$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Run a simple check to make sure TensorFlow is working.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ python
Python 3.9.6 (default, Aug 19 2021, 13:29:06)
[GCC 10.2.0] :: Anaconda, Inc. on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import tensorflow as tf
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print(tf.__version__)
2.5.0
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print(tf.reduce_sum(tf.random.normal([1000,1000])))
2021-08-27 17:21:47.972262: I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/process_util.cc:146] Creating new thread pool with default inter op setting: 2. Tune using inter_op_parallelism_threads for best performance.
tf.Tensor(-955.8242, shape=(), dtype=float32)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; exit()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Exit the tf environment and move on to install PyTorch.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ conda deactivate
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#install-pytorch"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Install PyTorch
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a new conda environment named torch, install PyTorch, and activate the new environment.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ conda create -n torch pytorch
$ conda activate torch
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The shell prompt will now show the tf environment.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;(torch) ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-251:~$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Run a simple check to make sure TensorFlow is working.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ python
Python 3.9.6 (default, Aug 19 2021, 13:29:06)
[GCC 10.2.0] :: Anaconda, Inc. on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import torch
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; x = torch.rand(5,3)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print(x)
tensor([[1.1011e-01, 8.9852e-02, 2.9613e-01],
        [5.8129e-01, 3.6840e-01, 4.8840e-04],
        [2.8552e-01, 9.0869e-02, 3.5286e-01],
        [5.6122e-01, 9.2791e-01, 9.2109e-01],
        [7.4704e-01, 7.4170e-01, 8.9604e-01]])
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; exit()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Try the &lt;a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/"&gt;MNIST&lt;/a&gt; example from &lt;a href="https://github.com/pytorch/examples"&gt;PyTorch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git clone https://github.com/pytorch/examples.git
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ cd examples
$ python main.py --epochs 2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are many machine learning articles and examples using MNIST and now they can be done on Graviton2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#wrapup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Wrap-up
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have spent many hours building machine learning frameworks from source for the Arm architecture. Although it’s challenging and satisfying to succeed, I can really appreciate how easy Anaconda makes getting started with TensorFlow and PyTorch on Graviton. Previously, the setup time was significant. With Anaconda, the setup time is short and there is more time available to create machine learning applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's great to see an Anaconda installer just for Graviton2 on the bottom of the &lt;a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual"&gt;installation page&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3qkiMiTV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c33x2z1bs4i4nfwnvms1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3qkiMiTV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c33x2z1bs4i4nfwnvms1.png" alt="Anaconda installers"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introducing Hoppscotch 2.0!! A fresh new perspective.</title>
      <author>Andrew Bastin</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 21:08:17 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/hoppscotch/introducing-hoppscotch-2-0-a-fresh-new-perspective-1j44</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/hoppscotch/introducing-hoppscotch-2-0-a-fresh-new-perspective-1j44</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week marks the 2nd anniversary of the Hoppscotch project. The &lt;a href="https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch/commit/91c08a5e6305cc95a0df46a33fdd0013bf7339b4"&gt;initial commit&lt;/a&gt; to the project was made two years ago on August 21. Since, then, we have garnered: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;21,000 monthly users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;450,000+ all-time users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;140 contributors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30,000+ GitHub stars&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These metrics are crazy and we want to thank all our users, our supporters, and our open source friends and contributors for helping us reach these numbers. Due to these huge numbers, we have realized we have large shoes to fill now. There is a much bigger expectation of what Hoppscotch is and should be. This marked a requirement for the project to be refactored so that every component of it can grow effectively with the expanded scope and today we are announcing our initial efforts towards this huge goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hoppscotch app over the span of 2 years had to grow from a simple app to a multi-faceted feature-heavy app. We have had many contributors come and go over the years and the codebase over this span didn't feature a fixed standard for how things are supposed to be done. This has lead to many inconsistent behaviors across the app and a really messy internal architecture. Hence, over the past few months, we devoted ourselves to working solely on building an infrastructure that could stand and support rapid growth. We accomplished this by splitting the codebase into properly segregated parts that communicate over well-defined interfaces and by following fixed proper code standards throughout the codebase. This effort is still a work in progress, but the base foundation for this effort is done. Hence, we are happy to introduce Hoppscotch 2.0, a release to mark the shift in perspective of what Hoppscotch is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uef0ckfz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8s5cdaknsk6e8oxaxrsm.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uef0ckfz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8s5cdaknsk6e8oxaxrsm.png" alt="screely-1630087497099"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, let's talk about the new design, we wanted to capture a UI that can evolve over time and yet feel familiar. We wanted it to be utilitarian and streamlined. A common complaint we received was all the excessive scrolling required to navigate the old interface and the negative space around the UI elements. Everything is cut short and made to the point with no scroll required to move around the app anymore. It's not just a new coat of paint, it also brought along with a bunch of extra features. One notable addition is the highlighting applied to environment variable references throughout the app, it's subtle, but it exposes important information like its validity (it turns red if the variable is invalid) and the current value. The streamlined internal architecture also brings the possibility for more seamless experiences. For example, Hoppscotch can now remember your session across devices (if you are logged in) and it can automatically save requests you have opened in your sessions. There are many more features in the works, which we can't wait to share with you later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had launched Hoppscotch for Teams last June as a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/liyasthomas/status/1402123004843155461"&gt;closed invite-only beta&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, we have received more than 400 invites. We have received feedback from about 30 companies and teams across the globe who has test-driven the feature and have reported their support and cited the ease of use and the low barrier of entry as the key positives. Teams will continue in a closed invite-only beta state for a month more, but we are hoping to start with the public beta by the end of September. If you and your team are interested to try out Teams, you can request an invite over at &lt;a href="https://hoppscotch.io/beta"&gt;https://hoppscotch.io/beta&lt;/a&gt;. We will be revealing more info about Teams and it's roadmap to general availability in the coming days, so stay tuned and follow us on our social channels to get the latest info!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the 2.0 release, we want to mark a change in perspective of what Hoppscotch should be as a project. We are setting our sights on building a collaborative platform, open and inviting from end to end where developers (and non-developers), whether as individuals or as teams can work with and collaborate on APIs. I believe as of right now, we have a solid base in API testing, we have rich support for REST, GraphQL, and many Real-time protocols and we actively see contributions from the OSS community regarding the improvements that can be made to all of these facets. Hence, we are planning to shift to our next plan which is &lt;em&gt;API Collaboration&lt;/em&gt;. With API Collaboration, we want to focus on developing features that help our users share, collaborate, and document APIs from within the Hoppscotch ecosystem itself. Hoppscotch for Teams is one of the core elements to this strategy, but we have more features in our pipeline we are working on which will be announced in the coming months. Another thing we are working towards in gradual but firm steps is providing a fully managed self-hostable version of Hoppscotch for the enterprises and teams which require it. Stay tuned to our social channels for this as Liyas will be announcing the plans of the project regarding the same later this week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoppscotch has been mostly a two-person team that until just recently worked on the project part-time. We had received a lot of help and useful contributions to the app from our amazing open source contributors and we are forever thankful to them and continue to look forward to the support of the team. But, that being said, the project has started to become too relevant and massive in scope for just two guys to tackle by themselves. Hence, we have decided it is time to start hiring! If you are interested in building with us the future of how we as developers work with APIs, please head on over to &lt;a href="https://forms.gle/2xM9x9NyYzirQ9ki8?_imcp=1"&gt;https://forms.gle/2xM9x9NyYzirQ9ki8?_imcp=1&lt;/a&gt; and have a look at our open positions. We can't wait to have you on our team!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like what you saw, what are you waiting for! Head on over to &lt;a href="https://hoppscotch.io"&gt;https://hoppscotch.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Password Generator With Bootstrap 5 And Javascript.</title>
      <author>prosperyong</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 21:01:56 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/yongdev/password-generator-with-bootstrap-5-and-javascript-3n70</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/yongdev/password-generator-with-bootstrap-5-and-javascript-3n70</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear friends and family: I hope you're doing well. Using Bootstrap and Javascript, I'll show you how to construct your own password generator with a copy button. To create safe passwords for DBMS(Database Management System) and other highly sensitive web applications, a password generator may be essential I included a copy button so you may copy the password and store it somewhere. If you use Google Chrome or other compatible browsers, they will urge you to save the created passwords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prerequisites"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Prerequisites.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should be familiar with Javascript.&lt;br&gt;
Knowledge of HTML and CSS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#youll-learn-how-to"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  You'll learn How to.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a Password Generator&lt;br&gt;
Copy button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;##Setup &amp;amp; Structure of Files.&lt;br&gt;
To begin, make a folder called Generator and arrange it as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#file-structure"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  File Structure
&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Generator:
├── assets
│   ├── css
│   │   ├── style.css
│   └──js
│      ├── passgen.js
│    
|
└── index.html
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-setting-the-javascript-magic-smile"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Setting The Javascript Magic 😄
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open the already created &lt;code&gt;passgen.html&lt;/code&gt; file and paste the following code into it&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;function genPass() {
    // define result variable 
    var Password = "";
    // define allowed characters
    var characters = "0123456789@#$%!-&amp;amp;*ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";

    // define length of password character
    var long = "30";
    for (var i = 0; i &amp;lt; long; i++) {
        // generate password
        gen = characters.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * characters.length));
        Password += gen;
    }
    // send the output to the input
    document.getElementById('pass').value = Password;
}
// Copy password button
function copy() {
    // get password from input text field
    var copyText = document.getElementById("pass");
    // Set selection range to copy longer text on mobile devices
    copyText.setSelectionRange(0, 9999);
    //Copy the text from the text field 
    navigator.clipboard.writeText(copyText.value);
    // Get the toast container
    var x = document.getElementById("toast")
    // Add the "show" class to the container
    x.className = "show";
    //Show toast for 3sec
    setTimeout(function() { x.className = x.className.replace("show", ""); }, 3000);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first thing we need to do is construct a function. You may call it whatever you want, but I went with genpass ().
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;function genPass() {
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In order to save the loop's output, we establish a variable named password.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;function genPass() {
// define result variable 
    var Password = "";
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next, we define the characters that can be used in the password string.You can even add new characters to the existing password string if you like.Before the alphabets, numbers and special characters were introduced to create a variable that was dominated by these characters.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;function genPass() {
// define result variable 
    var Password = "";
     // define allowed characters
    var characters = "0123456789@#$%!-&amp;amp;*ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";   
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then we define the length of our password.The string long was chosen for a reason that will be explained later.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;function genPass() {
// define result variable 
    var Password = "";
     // define allowed characters
    var characters = "0123456789@#$%!-&amp;amp;*ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";
    // define length of password character
    var long = "30";
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The password is then generated using a for loop.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;for (var i = 0; i &amp;lt; long; i++) {
        // generate password
        gen = characters.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * characters.length));
        Password += gen;
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A counter is created and set to zero before any loop execution begins. To construct counters, this phrase &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; is often used. The scope of variables generated here is the loop. They are deleted once the loop has ended.&lt;code&gt;for (var i = 0;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every iteration is preceded by a check for the condition.The condition is set to check if the counter is less than the specified length.This expression evaluates to true if it is omitted. The loop's statement is executed if it evaluates to true. The loop ends if it evaluates to false.&lt;code&gt;for (i &amp;lt; long;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After each iteration, the final expression &lt;code&gt;for (i++)&lt;/code&gt; is executed. If the condition is true, it increases the length of the long variable by the amount specified by the condition.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;for (var i = 0; i &amp;lt; long; i++) {
        // generate password
        gen = characters.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * characters.length));
        Password += gen;
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using the math.random() function, you would generate random passwords. Numbers are rounded to the closest integer using Math.floor. The &lt;code&gt;characters.length&lt;/code&gt; counts how many characters are in the character variable and creates a random string from that amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's finish off by putting the produced string in the input box. Using the tag's id, we transmit the value.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;document.getElementById('pass').value = Password;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-the-copy-function"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating the copy function
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing we need to do is construct a function. You may call it whatever you want, but I went with copy().&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to get the text to copy , we selected the element by its id.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next we called the selection range variable to copy a very long variable up to 9999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then we called the function to copy the text to clipboard.&lt;br&gt;
*Last but not least, we created a function to display a toast to indicate that the password was successfully copied.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
function copy() {
}
 // Copy password button
function copy() {
    // get password from input text field
    var copyText = document.getElementById("pass");
    // Set selection range to copy longer text on mobile devices
    copyText.setSelectionRange(0, 9999);
    //Copy the text from the text field 
    navigator.clipboard.writeText(copyText.value);
    // Get the toast container
    var x = document.getElementById("toast")
    // Add the "show" class to the container
    x.className = "show";
    //Show toast for 3sec
    setTimeout(function() { x.className = x.className.replace("show", ""); }, 3000);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-setting-html"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Setting HTML
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open the already created &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; file and paste the following code into it&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

      <title>Determine the kind of Software</title>
      <author>Prakhar Yadav</author>

      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#iterative-approach-effect-on-prerequisite"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Iterative approach effect on prerequisite
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different kinds of software projects need different balances between preparation and construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(scroll to the Appendix at the end to see some good practices for common kind of software practices)&lt;/em&gt; 👇 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some projects need iterative &amp;amp; some need sequential approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;misinformed opinion&lt;/code&gt; is that iterative techniques don't need to focus on prerequisites.&lt;br&gt;
However in reality, Iterative approaches only tend to reduce the impact of inadequate upstream work, but they don’t eliminate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pRkdR9lk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630089987527/iPsNh7Adq.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pRkdR9lk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630089987527/iPsNh7Adq.png" alt="poster showing stop misinformation slogan"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example &lt;strong&gt;table below compares 2 approaches&lt;/strong&gt; with respect to prerequisites. Approach 1 relies solely on testing &amp;amp; discovers defects later, making the cost higher, and Approach 2 discovers defects iteratively as the project progresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Skipping Prerequisites&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Focusing on Prerequisites&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lzk66kRA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630088826811/lxW77-9ip.jpeg" alt="tabular representation of skipping prerequisite cost in both approaches"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WhO6XRSw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630088856875/HIynBJs1J.jpeg" alt="tabular representation of costs when prerequisites are focused in both approaches"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A focus on prerequisites can reduce costs regardless of whether you use an iterative or a sequential approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most projects are neither completely sequential nor completely iterative. It isn’t practical to specify 100% of the requirements or design up front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q7pivhiC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630090425063/eehHslclL.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q7pivhiC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630090425063/eehHslclL.jpeg" alt="thumb image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;One common rule of thumb&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is to plan to specify about 80 percent of the requirements up front, and then practice systematic change control to accept only the most valuable new requirements. Another alternative is to specify only the most important 20 percent of the requirements up front and plan to develop the rest of the software in small increments.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-choose-between-iterative-and-sequential-approaches"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to choose between Iterative and Sequential Approaches
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--syR_SD2R--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630090559663/EQEDpe_G4.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--syR_SD2R--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630090559663/EQEDpe_G4.jpeg" alt="a thinking gorilla"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You might &lt;strong&gt;choose&lt;/strong&gt; a more &lt;strong&gt;sequential&lt;/strong&gt; (upfront) &lt;strong&gt;approach&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;when&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;requirements are fairly stable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;design is straightforward and well understood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;development team is familiar with the applications area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;project contains little risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might &lt;strong&gt;choose&lt;/strong&gt; a more &lt;strong&gt;iterative&lt;/strong&gt; (as-you-go) &lt;strong&gt;approach when&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;requirements are not well understood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;design is complex.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;development team is unfamiliar with the applications area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;project contains a lot of risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>A New Way To Use Apple Mail For Email Sanity 🤯</title>

  &lt;a href="#this-article-is-intended-for-apple-users%E2%80%8A%E2%80%8Aas-the-primary-email-application-that-will-be-used-is-the-apple-mail-app-in-this-article-youll-learn-about-a-workflow-i-use-to-follow-the-inbox-zero-approach-without-having-to-navigate-between-different-apps"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;This article is intended for apple users -- as the primary email application that will be used is the Apple Mail app. In this article, you'll learn about a workflow I use to follow the Inbox Zero approach without having to navigate between different apps.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h6&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tldr"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  TL;DR
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple Mail can be used as an "email aggregator" that works as a holistic app for you to handle all your incoming emails from Gmail, Outlook, &lt;em&gt;[insert other email service providers]&lt;/em&gt;, etc. &lt;strong&gt;In a nutshell, the "magic sauce" is a mixture of the email forwarding feature all email service providers have and the Apple ecosystem with Apple Mail&lt;/strong&gt;. The workflow requires all emails to be forwarded to your iCloud email address. After that, the only job to do is to follow an Inbox Zero approach &lt;em&gt;(keeping your inbox empty or almost empty)&lt;/em&gt; for your iCloud Inbox. Yes, it's really that simple 🤷‍♂️. In this article, I'll go into further details about why using Apple Mail and basic email forwarding can significantly improve the way you handle your emails.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Before diving in, keep in mind some of these pros and cons I've experienced using this workflow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pros"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Pros:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Takes advantage of the Apple ecosystem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduces the number of apps you need to manage your emails with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doesn't rely on a 3rd-party service (often a paid service) to aggregate your emails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keeps a "backup" of your original emails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easier to follow the Inbox Zero approach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On macOS, Apple Mail automatically sets the correct email address to reply from&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cons"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cons:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tedious initial setup -- depends on how many email accounts you need to add to your device(s) (personally, I had 8 email accounts I had to set up on 4 devices -- iPhone, iPad, Mac Pro, MacBook Pro)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iCloud Mail service downtime (I haven't experienced this, but thought I should include this based on some google results talking about this issue)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On iOS and iPadOS, Apple Mail doesn't automatically set the correct email address to reply from (other email apps don't as well)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lets-get%C2%A0started"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Let's Get Started! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-create-icloud-email-address-amp%C2%A0enable"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Create iCloud Email Address &amp;amp; Enable
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven't already done so, you'll need to create your iCloud email address and enable iCloud Mail in your iCloud account. If you're on macOS, you can set up your iCloud email address by going to Internet Accounts from System Preferences and enabling Mail from your iCloud account. If you're on iOS or iPadOS, enabling iCloud Mail in your iCloud account will prompt you to create an email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--92yg05uV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pnnx2qpn5bsbirm17ooa.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--92yg05uV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pnnx2qpn5bsbirm17ooa.png" alt="On macOS, go to Systems Preferences to access Internet Accounts (left). On iOS &amp;amp; iPadOS, go to Settings then iCloud to access iCloud Mail (right)"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;
  &lt;a href="#on-macos-go-to-systems-preferences-to-access-internet-accounts-left-on-ios-amp-ipados-go-to-settings-then-icloud-to-access-icloud-mail-right"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;On macOS, go to Systems Preferences to access Internet Accounts (left). On iOS &amp;amp; iPadOS, go to Settings then iCloud to access iCloud Mail (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-add-all-email-addresses-to-your-devices"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Add All Email Addresses To Your Device(s)
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each device, you'll have to add all your Gmail, Outlook, etc. email accounts. For macOS, you can do so by going to Internet Accounts (make sure these accounts are enabled by going to the Mail app preferences). For iOS and iPadOS, navigate to Apple Mail under settings and tap Accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dzArHlGy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xe2yvkarp7tmqvd422r5.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dzArHlGy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xe2yvkarp7tmqvd422r5.png" alt='On macOS Apple Mail, navigate to accounts and make sure "enable this account" checkbox is selected for all email addresses.'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;
  &lt;a href="#on-macos-apple-mail-navigate-to-accounts-and-make-sure-enable-this-account-checkbox-is-selected-for-all-email-addresses"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;On macOS Apple Mail, navigate to accounts and make sure "enable this account" checkbox is selected for all email addresses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-forward-all-email-addresses-to-icloud%C2%A0email"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Forward All Email Addresses To iCloud Email
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With your iCloud email address created and email accounts added to your device(s), it's time to start forwarding all your other email address to iCloud. For brevity, I've only included images of the steps to take for Gmail. The steps should be similar for other email service providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--s2ZRDHAq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9zhdir4dqc2kp6njxfla.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--s2ZRDHAq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9zhdir4dqc2kp6njxfla.png" alt='Click the gear icon to access all settings (left). From the Settings page, navigate to "Forwarding and POP/IMAP" to add a forwarding email address (right)'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;
  &lt;a href="#click-the-gear-icon-to-access-all-settings-left-from-the-settings-page-navigate-to-forwarding-and-popimap-to-add-a-forwarding-email-address-right"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Click the gear icon to access all settings (left). From the Settings page, navigate to "Forwarding and POP/IMAP" to add a forwarding email address (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you've added a forwarding email address, click Forward a copy of incoming mail to and select the iCloud email address. After doing so, you'll have the option to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep Gmail's copy in the Inbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mark Gmail's copy as read&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archive Gmail's copy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delete Gmail's copy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to keep a "backup" of your emails, don't select Delete Gmail's copy. This is just personal preference. Any other option, when enabled, will keep the original email even if you delete the forwarded email from your iCloud Inbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-organize-apple%C2%A0mail"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Organize Apple Mail
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After forwarding all your emails, it's time to start organizing Apple Mail to your liking. The placement and settings for each inbox in Apple Mail is device-dependent, so you'll have to repeat this process for each device. For reference, I've included an image below of my sidebar configuration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--04ocRBZD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7z9mu6t0imk35i8o8r8q.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--04ocRBZD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7z9mu6t0imk35i8o8r8q.png" alt="My macOS Apple Mail sidebar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-macos-apple-mail-sidebar"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;My macOS Apple Mail sidebar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this workflow, the main objective is to reach Inbox Zero from your iCloud Inbox. So, I moved the iCloud email account towards the top and minimized all other email accounts. It's important to note that for consistency, all email actions from replying to deleting should be done only in the iCloud Inbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-delete-old-email-apps%C2%A0"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Delete Old Email Apps 🎉
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally! It's time to delete your old email apps and be on your way to reaching Inbox Zero!&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#faqs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  FAQs
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-forward-emails-to-an-icloud-email-instead-of-just-adding-email-accounts-to-apple%C2%A0mail"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why forward emails to an iCloud email instead of just adding email accounts to Apple Mail?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the major issues of using email services providers with Apple Mail, specifically for iOS and iPadOS, is how data is received (i.e. how you get a new email notification). Because push notification is no longer supported, the only methods available are fetch and manual. This means that notifications won't show up in real-time. You can set the data to be fetched manually at a 15 minute interval but this would lead to battery drain and more data usage. The benefits of push are real-time notifications, less battery drain, and less data usage. So, you need an iCloud email for Apple Mail to have push notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-not-use-the-gmailoutlook-app-to-manage-multiple%C2%A0emails"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why not use the Gmail/Outlook app to manage multiple emails?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can! But there's one caveat for Gmail -- no Gmail app on the Mac App Store. This means that for macOS, you'll have to stick to juggling between different windows and tabs to access all your Gmail accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#does-this-workflow-trap-you-in-the-apple-ecosystem"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Does this workflow trap you in the Apple ecosystem?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. Rather than replacing your email accounts to a single iCloud email address, this email workflow describes a method of "email aggregation" to easily follow the Inbox Zero approach. Also, when you're on a non-Apple device, you can always manage your iCloud email from &lt;a href="https://icloud.com"&gt;Apple's iCloud home page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;a href="#%EF%B8%8F-bonus-tip-custom-email-signatures"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ⭐️ Bonus Tip: Custom Email Signatures
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cool feature of Apple Mail on macOS is Apple Mail's ability to automatically set the correct email address to respond from (this also means a custom signature you set for your email address will be used!). To set your custom signatures on iOS and iPadOS, head over to Apple Mail under settings and select Signatures. After doing so, select Per Account -- if you have different signatures for different email addresses. For macOS, go to Apple Mail's preferences page and select the Signatures tab. If you're using a styled signature, make sure to uncheck Always match my default message font before pasting your signature to retain your custom layout and font styles.&lt;br&gt;

  Author's Note
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for taking the time to read about an email workflow that I've been using to manage my personal and work email addresses. Personally, I've disciplined myself to keep my iCloud Inbox empty by the end of the day. In doing so, this has made a huge impact on my overall productivity. I'm excited to share my email workflow and I would love to hear about your email workflow in the Discussion below!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Be Positive. Stay Productive.-&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Build your first website with flask!</title>
      <author>chrisMurimi</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 19:48:48 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/chris_murimi/build-your-first-website-with-flask-1nea</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/chris_murimi/build-your-first-website-with-flask-1nea</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, we'll be creating a complete login and registration system with Python Flask and MySQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python is currently taking the web development scene by storm, growing consistently every year. It's easy to get started with Python and doesn't require as many dependencies that you need to download separately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get started with the project will set up the required packages for our project.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir flaskproject
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;use the above command to create your project directory that will hold your project files.&lt;br&gt;
Then navigate to the directory and create your python project file.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;strong&gt;navigating to the directory we have created for the project&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd flaskproject
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;creating our python project&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;touch flaskweb.py
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;we will also create a folder named templates that will hold our html files and another file named static that will hold the css files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;we will create our html files here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir templates
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;we will create our css files here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir static
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We will then install a virtual environment in our flaskproject folder. &lt;em&gt;Python virtual environments help decouple and isolate versions of Python and associated pip packages. This allows end-users to install and manage their own set of packages that are independent of those provided by the system.&lt;/em&gt; Run the following command on you command prompt.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip install virtualenv
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;we will then create a virtual environment for our project.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;virtualenv dev
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;we will then start the virtual environment.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;source dev/Scripts/activate
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To be able to use flask we need to install it to our project. Using pip on your command prompt install flask.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip install flask
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;we are now set to start the project. Open the project in your favorite IDE. For my case I love vscode. Add to open my project on my command prompt I can run the following command.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;code flaskweb.py
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We then build the very basic flask app and run to test if everything is working perfect.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;flask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="n"&gt;Flask&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Flask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;regiter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"__main__"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;debug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If every thing is working perfectly, create your html and css files. Go to the template folder and create and create 'login.html', 'layout.html', and 'home.html' files. Then open the static folder and create a file named 'style.css'. &lt;em&gt;Note you can open the folder in the vscode and add the files from there.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="/C:/Users/chris%20murimi/Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot%20(311).png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="/C:/Users/chris%20murimi/Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot%20(311).png" alt="Your folder should look like this"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will then create functions with routes, and render our html files.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;flask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Flask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;render_template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;url_for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;session&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Flask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/logout"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"__main__"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;debug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are now going d design our web page using html and css. We will first create our layout page that will hold the similar content for all our html files to reduce redundancy.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

         {% block title %}
        &lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- we are using jinja templates to create a block where code from other html files will be passed--&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        {% endblock title %}

        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;rel=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"stylesheet"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"{{url_for('static', filename='login.css')}}"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;


    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    {% block body%}


    {%endblock body%}
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will then create login and register forms in our login.html file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{% extends 'layout.html' %}
{% block title%}
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   {%if title%} 
        {{title}}
    {% else%}
        login
    {% endif %}
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;




{%endblock title%}

{% block body%}
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"login-wrap"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"login-html"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"tab-1"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"radio"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"tab"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"sign-in"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;checked&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;for=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"tab-1"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"tab"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Sign In&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"tab-2"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"radio"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"tab"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"sign-up"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;for=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"tab-2"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"tab"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Sign Up&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"login-form"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

                    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;


                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"hr"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

{%endblock body%}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We will then create our home page.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{% extends 'layout.html' %}
{% block title%}
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   {%if title%} 
        {{title}}
    {% else%}
        home
    {% endif %}
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
{%endblock title%}

{% block body%}

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Home Page&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome back, {{ username }}!&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

{%endblock body%}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The we are going to add content in our style.css file in our static folder.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sx"&gt;url(../images/loginbackground.jpg)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;no-repeat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;600&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;16px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;18px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;'Open Sans'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sans-serif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.login-html&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.sign-in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:checked&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.tab&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.sign-up&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.tab&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.login-form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.sign-in-htm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;rotate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.login-html&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.sign-up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:checked&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.tab&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.login-form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.sign-up-htm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;rotate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.hr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;2px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;60px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;50px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;rgba&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;.2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.foot-lnk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;text-align&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What remains now is getting data from our html forms. But before we do that we have to connect our application with a database. In this case we are using mysql database.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zAAvAkfO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.mysql.com/downloads/" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zAAvAkfO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.mysql.com/downloads/" alt="You can download and install mysql database for your operating system here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
When your mySQL is set, &lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---Nnwuvv3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/http://localhost/phpmyadmin/sql.php%3F" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---Nnwuvv3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/http://localhost/phpmyadmin/sql.php%3F" alt="navigate to the browser"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; create a new database with your favorite name.&lt;br&gt;
Then use the following sql code to create a table in your database with the given values&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sql"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;CREATE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;TABLE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;IF&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;EXISTS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;`users`&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;`id`&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;AUTO_INCREMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;`username`&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;varchar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;`password`&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;varchar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;`email`&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;varchar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;PRIMARY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;KEY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;`id`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;``&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;




We will then link the database with our project. To facilatate this we have to install pymysql module that will help us in the connection. Open your command prompt and use pip to install the module.


&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;``&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cmd&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;pip&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pymysql&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;we will then move to our flaskweb.py file and import the module.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;flask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Flask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;render_template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;url_for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;session&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pymysql&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using the module we will then create a connection with our database.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;flask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Flask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;render_template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;url_for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;session&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pymysql&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;pp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Flask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# database connection details 
# Intializing MySQL
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;connection&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pymysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'localhost'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'root'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;database&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'luxproject'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We will then retrive data from our html forms using post method we used to send the data to our route.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/register"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;methods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'POST'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'GET'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;regiter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;method&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"POST"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'username'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;phone&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'phone'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'password'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We will then check the data input by the user, validate if it meet our standard and send it to our data base.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'/register'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;methods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'GET'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'POST'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;register&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Check if "username", "password" and "email" POST requests exist (user submitted form)
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;method&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'POST'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'username'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'password'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'email'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Create variables for easy access
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="n"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'username'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'password'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'email'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Show registration form with message (if any)

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;cursor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = {}'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,))&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;account&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cursor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fetchone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# If account exists show error and validation checks
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;account&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'Account already exists!'&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;elif&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;re&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Account doesnt exists and the form data is valid, now insert new account into accounts table

        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Form is empty... (no POST data)

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We will also create our login session. Here we will get user input and compare with the data in our database, if user exist we will let him in.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Fetch one record and return result

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Account doesnt exist or username/password incorrect
&lt;/span&gt;            &lt;span class="n"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'Incorrect username/password!'&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;render_template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'login.html'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We will also create the home and the logout functions.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Home function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Check if user is loggedin
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'loggedin'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# User is loggedin show them the home page
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;render_template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'home.html'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'username'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# User is not loggedin redirect to login page
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;redirect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;url_for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'login'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;logout function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'/pythonlogin/logout'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;logout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Remove session data, this will log the user out
&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="n"&gt;session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'loggedin'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="n"&gt;session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'id'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="n"&gt;session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'username'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Redirect to login page
&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;redirect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;url_for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'login'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now our flaskweb.py file should look as follows.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;re&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;flask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Flask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;render_template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;url_for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;session&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pymysql&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;werkzeug.utils&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;redirect&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Flask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# database connection details 
# Intializing MySQL
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;connection&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pymysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'localhost'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'root'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;database&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'luxproject'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'/'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Check if user is loggedin

        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# User is loggedin show them the home page

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;cursor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = {}'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,))&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;account&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cursor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fetchone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

      <title>java-ngrok - a Java wrapper for ngrok</title>
      <author>Alex Laird</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 19:19:54 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/alexdlaird/java-ngrok-a-java-wrapper-for-ngrok-2a15</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/alexdlaird/java-ngrok-a-java-wrapper-for-ngrok-2a15</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tpAq-YR_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://github.com/alexdlaird/java-ngrok/raw/main/logo.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img alt="java-ngrok - a Java wrapper for ngrok" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tpAq-YR_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://github.com/alexdlaird/java-ngrok/raw/main/logo.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;java-ngrok&lt;/code&gt; is a Java wrapper for &lt;code&gt;ngrok&lt;/code&gt; that manages its own binary, making &lt;code&gt;ngrok&lt;/code&gt; available via a convenient Java&lt;br&gt;
API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ngrok.com"&gt;ngrok&lt;/a&gt; is a reverse proxy tool that opens secure tunnels from public URLs to localhost, perfect for exposing local web servers, building webhook integrations, enabling SSH access, testing chatbots, demoing from your own machine, and more, and its made even more powerful with native Java integration through &lt;code&gt;java-ngrok&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installation
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;java-ngrok&lt;/code&gt; is available on &lt;a href="https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.github.alexdlaird/java-ngrok/"&gt;Maven Central&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#maven"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Maven
&lt;/h4&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight xml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;com.github.alexdlaird&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;java-ngrok&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;1.5.3&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#gradle"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Gradle
&lt;/h4&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight groovy"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;implementation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"com.github.alexdlaird:java-ngrok:1.5.3"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If we want &lt;code&gt;ngrok&lt;/code&gt; to be available from the command line, &lt;a href="https://github.com/alexdlaird/pyngrok"&gt;pyngrok&lt;/a&gt; can be&lt;br&gt;
installed using &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt; to manage that for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#basic-usage"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Basic Usage
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All &lt;code&gt;ngrok&lt;/code&gt; functionality is available through the &lt;a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.github.alexdlaird/java-ngrok/latest/com/github/alexdlaird/ngrok/NgrokClient.html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;NgrokClient&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. To open a tunnel, use the &lt;a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.github.alexdlaird/java-ngrok/latest/com/github/alexdlaird/ngrok/NgrokClient.html#connect(com.github.alexdlaird.ngrok.protocol.CreateTunnel)"&gt;&lt;code&gt;connect&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; method, which returns a &lt;code&gt;Tunnel&lt;/code&gt;, and this returned object has a reference to the public URL generated by &lt;code&gt;ngrok&lt;/code&gt;, which can be retrieved with &lt;a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.github.alexdlaird/java-ngrok/latest/com/github/alexdlaird/ngrok/protocol/Tunnel.html#getPublicUrl()"&gt;&lt;code&gt;getPublicUrl()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;NgrokClient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ngrokClient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;NgrokClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;Builder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Open a HTTP tunnel on the default port 80&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// &amp;lt;Tunnel: "http://&amp;lt;public_sub&amp;gt;.ngrok.io" -&amp;gt; "http://localhost:80"&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Tunnel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;httpTunnel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ngrokClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Open a SSH tunnel&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// &amp;lt;Tunnel: "tcp://0.tcp.ngrok.io:12345" -&amp;gt; "localhost:22"&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;CreateTunnel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sshCreateTunnel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;CreateTunnel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;Builder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;withProto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Proto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;TCP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;withAddr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Tunnel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sshTunnel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ngrokClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sshCreateTunnel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.github.alexdlaird/java-ngrok/latest/com/github/alexdlaird/ngrok/NgrokClient.html#connect(com.github.alexdlaird.ngrok.protocol.CreateTunnel)"&gt;&lt;code&gt;connect&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; method can also take a &lt;a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.github.alexdlaird/java-ngrok/latest/com/github/alexdlaird/ngrok/protocol/CreateTunnel.html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;CreateTunnel&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (which can be built through &lt;a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.github.alexdlaird/java-ngrok/latest/com/github/alexdlaird/ngrok/protocol/CreateTunnel.Builder.html"&gt;its Builder&lt;/a&gt;) that allows us to pass additional properties that are &lt;a href="https://ngrok.com/docs#tunnel-definitions"&gt;supported by ngrok&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming we have also installed &lt;a href="https://github.com/alexdlaird/pyngrok"&gt;pyngrok&lt;/a&gt;, all features of &lt;code&gt;ngrok&lt;/code&gt; are available on the command line.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ngrok http 80
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For details on how to fully leverage &lt;code&gt;ngrok&lt;/code&gt; from the command line, see &lt;a href="https://ngrok.com/docs"&gt;ngrok's official documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#documentation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Documentation
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more advanced usage, &lt;code&gt;java-ngrok&lt;/code&gt;'s official documentation is available at &lt;a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.github.alexdlaird/java-ngrok"&gt;https://javadoc.io/doc/com.github.alexdlaird/java-ngrok&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#java-8"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Java 8
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java 8 support is not actively maintained, but a compatible build of this project does exist for Java 8. To use it,&lt;br&gt;
include the &lt;code&gt;java8-ngrok&lt;/code&gt; dependency from &lt;a href="https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.github.alexdlaird/java8-ngrok/"&gt;Maven Central&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight xml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;com.github.alexdlaird&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;java8-ngrok&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;1.4.3&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/lang/ProcessHandle.html"&gt;Process API&lt;/a&gt; was introduced in Java 9, so certain convenience methods around managing the &lt;code&gt;ngrok&lt;/code&gt; process (for instance, tearing it down) are not available in the Java 8 build.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was asked this question in an interview sitting a couple of months ago. I'm pretty sure some of you really ever thought of changing something in JS language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be happy to know your opinion in the comment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Your Check Engine light is on: how to write good software tests</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We’ve all experienced the effects of chaos and entropy. You put your neatly-wired earbuds in your pocket only to pull them out in the most tangled mess imaginable. How a single cable managed to twist itself into 25 knots in three minutes is beyond explanation, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, the same thing happens in software development. You update a few simple lines of code, run the test suite, and some random test throws a meaningless error. (“PC Load Letter? What the f--- does that mean?!”) You investigate only to find the error is coming from a critical piece of code no one has dared to touch for 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to understand the impact of our code changes via test suites, especially when pushing to complex, highly-integrated repositories. You could suggest refactoring the test suite, but that’s a lot of technical debt your team can’t afford to take on right now. You can already hear the project manager saying, “I’ll put it on the backlog with all the other stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizations across the globe suffer from these types of problems. Why? Because it’s all too easy to build an incredibly complex system without realizing it. And by that time, it’s too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way out of this scenario is with better testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-software-testing-matters"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why software testing matters
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective software testing allows developers to focus on concerns that are complicated. The greater the complexity, the more challenging it is to model. Therefore, it’s &lt;strong&gt;critical to write de-coupled, repeatable tests that provide important, meaningful signals&lt;/strong&gt;. There’s a lot packed into that statement, so we’re going to break it down in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the simple stuff. There are two main benefits to software testing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase confidence while moving code toward production&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase the velocity of that movement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closer code gets to production, the more it needs to be exercised. The more exercise code gets, the more confidence one can have in its production viability. &lt;strong&gt;Confidence comes from well-written tests that provide information on where problems exist.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But confidence alone is not enough; &lt;strong&gt;speed to production is equally important&lt;/strong&gt;. Modern businesses cannot tolerate painstakingly-detailed testing of every change. There’s a middle ground between being too laser-focused on small things and writing tests that cover the universe in one go. That’s where the most valuable testing takes place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how should a developer determine what testing is valuable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-a-good-software-test"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is a good software test?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good software tests have well-defined characteristics and goals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prove your software works&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prove your software does what it’s expected to do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prove your assumptions about the software hold true&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prove something relatively complicated works under a variety of scenarios and works with other components as expected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give a strong, meaningful signal that is informative and unambiguous&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run quickly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are repeatable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are free of side-effects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several of these are obvious, but a few are not. We like to think of failed tests like a “Check Engine” light on a car. The Check Engine light doesn’t offer any valuable information on its own. But a car mechanic has equipment to get more meaningful data from the vehicle’s diagnostics system. If the light is on and the diagnostic is “Engine valve #2 is loose,” that’s a meaningful signal and the mechanic can get right to the repair. Otherwise, the mechanic has to run an extensive set of tests to identify the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Software test results need to provide diagnostic information that’s valuable to a developer or quality engineer.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s not enough to say, “Database error.” A good test should say, “Failed to connect to database” and surface the exact error message coming from the database connector itself. Clear error messages like these are informative, unambiguous, and can lead a developer to the exact lines of code that need correction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good tests are repeatable and can run in any order without dependencies.&lt;/strong&gt; In other words, they’re idempotent. And good tests model a wide variety of use cases. For example, you may not want to send email as part of a system, but you should model it such that all the ways emails can fail are handled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-a-good-test-suite"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is a good test suite?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A test suite is a collection of good tests that model a wide variety of use cases and run as quickly as possible. Whereas good tests provide confidence about isolated instances of change, a good test suite provides confidence that under normal circumstances, the entire context will operate successfully. &lt;strong&gt;Good test suites make dependency changes clear, help developers move fast, increase confidence of submitting and approving pull requests, and reveal bad tests&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, a bad test suite is executed less and less over time because it does not create or increase confidence in the overall system. People stop running bad test suites because they:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are unmanageable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are slow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serve only a few people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leave developers shrugging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are vulnerable to dependency changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are overly comprehensive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fake or mock out too much of the environment/context&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have probably heard the saying, “If a tree falls in the woods and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound?” Our corollary is, “If you write tests and no one runs them until the last minute, does it prove your software is ready for production?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9KB79GYc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/188zhhfqb2jkyjicuogp.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9KB79GYc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/188zhhfqb2jkyjicuogp.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An overly comprehensive test suite tests too much breadth. If you’re testing 2+2=4 and it’s not failed in the last 25 years, then it doesn’t tell you anything when it passes. If you have a test that tests everything in the system, you’ve basically got a Check Engine light. If it takes 25 minutes for a test to execute and it fails at the end, it’s probably a waste of 25 minutes. (Also, we think &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://yourbase.io/blog/even-10-minute-test-suites-are-too-slow/"&gt;even 10 minutes is too long&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to wait for a test suite to finish execution.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#writing-tests-that-provide-value-confidence-and-increased-velocity"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Writing tests that provide value, confidence, and increased velocity
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be difficult to identify the “middle ground” between being too laser-focused on small things and writing tests that cover the universe in one go. Significant progress can be made by eliminating tests that take too long, provide meaningless information, never fail, serve only a few people, are vulnerable to dependency changes, and lack idempotency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers are best served by tests that focus on code that’s complicated. Confidence can increase with tests that cover a wide variety of failure scenarios and provide strong meaningful signals about those failures. Such tests should be written to run quickly and free of side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closer code gets to production, the more it gets exercised. Test suites that are chock-full of quick, meaningful tests will increase confidence. When that code is deployed there should be very few questions about production viability.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sharpen your Ruby: Part 4</title>
      <author>Eric The Coder</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 18:59:42 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/ericchapman/sharpen-your-ruby-part-4-15a3</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/ericchapman/sharpen-your-ruby-part-4-15a3</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I develop in Javascript, Python, PHP, and Ruby. By far Ruby is my favorite programming language. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together let start a journey and revisit our Ruby foundations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow me on Twitter: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EricTheCoder_"&gt;EricTheCoder_&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions/comments or you are new and need help, you can comment below or send me a message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Whats is a Method?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Methods are a powerful feature for building Ruby programs, they allow you to encapsulate behavior and call the method later on to build a full program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Method syntax&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Method name must start with a letter. It may contain letters, numbers, an _ (underscore or low line). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The convention is to use underscores to separate words in a multiword method name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Method is declared with the 'def' keyword followed by the method name and parameters and finish with an 'end' keyword&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Method parameters are specified after the method name and are enclosed in parentheses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To invoke (call) the method you just use is name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;display_message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nb"&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Calling the method&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;display_message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Hello World'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# or with optional parentheses&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;display_message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Hello World'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Methods Return value&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby specifically has a unique way of working with returned values. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby automatically return the last line of the method&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;addition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;addition&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 15&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That is the exact same thing as this&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;addition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;addition&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 15&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since the last line is always return, the return keyword is optional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attention. This can be confusing:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;addition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nb"&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;addition&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 15&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# empty&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since the last line always returns Ruby return the results of the puts method and that's nothing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there is a clear difference between returning a + b vs returning puts a + b&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By convention, the keyword 'return' is never used if we want to return the last line (since that's the Ruby default).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the keyword 'return' need to be used if we want to return something before the last line:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;check&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Number too high'&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Number is correct'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# call the method to test the result&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;check&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;120&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;30&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Number too high&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;check&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Number are correct&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This method will return 'Number too high' if variable 'a' is greater than 100. After the return the method will end. So the last line will never be executed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If variable 'a' is less or equal to 100. The method will return 'Number is correct'. And again, since it is the last line of the method the 'return' keyword is optional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Method name that end with a ?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Ruby some method name end with a ?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;even?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;odd?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By convention methods that end with a '?' always return a boolean value (true or false).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can create your own boolean method:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;is_valid?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kp"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kp"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# call the method&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;is_valid?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'secret'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Method name that end with a !&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Ruby some method names ends with a ! Those methods are call bang methods. Bang method modifies an object in place. This can be dangerous because it changes the object value and that may be not your intent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Ruby has two reverse methods one regular and one bang!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;reverse&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# and&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;reverse!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The bang! method will change the value of the object in-place&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Mike'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;reverse!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# ekiM&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# that method bang! will have also update the name variable&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# ekiM&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Methods arguments default value&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible to set default value for method parameter&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;addition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;addition&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 110&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since b is not specified Ruby use it default value of 10&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Methods Named Arguments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since an image is worth a thousand words let look at this example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;calculation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;shipping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;taxes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="n"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;shipping_fee&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;taxes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;calculation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 270&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you can see, with multiple arguments it can become difficult to read understand which arguments is what.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Named arguments are made for that kind of situation:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;calculation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;shipping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;taxes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="n"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;shipping&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;taxes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;calculation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;shipping&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;taxes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 270&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now the method used is clearer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another good thing about named arguments is that you can change the order of the arguments.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;calculation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;taxes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;shipping&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 270&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;Exercise&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a little program that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a method name subtraction with 3 arguments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That method with return the result of subtraction of the 3 numbers pass as arguments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the last argument is not specified it will be treated as default value of 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call that method and print its result&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solution&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;subtraction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;subtraction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 50&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Se você esta lendo esse post tem 99.90% de chance de você estar lendo ele através da internet, o outro 0.10% de chance você provavelmente é assinante do Internet Impressa, um serviço aonde você semanalmente recebe todas novidades da internet impressa por correio. Você também pode assinar a internet em video que te manda fitas VHS dos melhores videos da internet, ou se você quiser uma fita com um AMV do Rock Lee contra o Gaara ao som de Linkin Park. Acho que eles também tem o Internet em video XXX que você já sabe o que é.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mas não estamos aqui para falar sobre esse grandioso serviço, na verdade esse post é o contrario, aqui nós vamos falar sobre como podemos servir nossas aplicações através da internet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Você pode achar o repositório com o exemplo em: &lt;a href="https://github.com/andre2w/webserver-post-examples"&gt;https://github.com/andre2w/webserver-post-examples&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#webservers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Webservers
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Começando pelo mais básico nós temos que servir arquivos estáticos. Você vai lá escreve todo o HTML, CSS e JavaScript para um site, igual se fazia antigamente, quando a era tudo mato.  Agora você precisa um jeito de servir esses arquivos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assim como a Internet Impressa uma grande parte da internet costumava ser arquivos estáticos que não mudavam programaticamente. Alguém tinha que ir lá e escrever o &lt;code&gt;.html&lt;/code&gt;, o &lt;code&gt;.css&lt;/code&gt; e o &lt;code&gt;.js&lt;/code&gt; e esses arquivos eram enviados para o servidor e assim que você entrasse no site esses arquivos eram enviados para o seu browser do jeito que eles foram escritos.&lt;br&gt;
Sem transpilador, sem polyfill, sem nenhuma alteração.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mas agora precisamos servir esses arquivos para quem acessa o seu site, e não só isso é preciso diferenciar qual pagina você está acessando através do caminho na URL. Nós podemos fazer isso utilizando um Webserver. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geralmente o Webservers serve os arquivos convertendo o caminho da url em uma estrutura de pastas. Então se você tentar acessar:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;http://localhost:3030/blog/posts/webserver.html&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um Webserver configurado para ter a pasta &lt;code&gt;pages&lt;/code&gt; como a raiz vai procurar no seguinte caminho:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pages
+- blog
+-- posts
+--- webserver.html
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Web servers também serve para servir imagens e qualquer outro arquivo estático através de maneira eficiente. Então vamos criar um webserver básico em TypeScript só por motivos que podemos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Começamos os arquivos que vamos servir, vamos começar com um &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; e um &lt;code&gt;404.html&lt;/code&gt; dentro de uma pasta chamada pages.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- pages/index.html --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;html&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;lang=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"en"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;charset=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"UTF-8"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;http-equiv=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"X-UA-Compatible"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"IE=edge"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"viewport"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Document&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Hello, World!&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- pages/404.html --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;html&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;lang=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"en"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;charset=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"UTF-8"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;http-equiv=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"X-UA-Compatible"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"IE=edge"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"viewport"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Document&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    Pagina não encontrada!
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Agora vamos criar o nosso Webserver para servir essas duas paginas. Em &lt;code&gt;src/index.ts&lt;/code&gt; nós criamos.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;requestListener&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;IncomingMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ServerResponse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;readFileSync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;__dirname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;pages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;index.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;writeHead&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Retorna o status code 200 - OK&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Envia o conteudo do arquivo index.html como resposta &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;notFound&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;readFileSync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;__dirname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;pages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;404.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;writeHead&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;404&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Retorna o status code 404 - Not Found&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;notFound&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;server&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createServer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;requestListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;server&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3030&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Agora se rodarmos essa aplicação e acessarmos &lt;code&gt;[localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030)&lt;/code&gt; você vai ver o conteúdo de &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; e se for qualquer outra pagina você vera o conteúdo de &lt;code&gt;404.html&lt;/code&gt;. Agora precisamos mudar isso para servirmos outras paginas baseadas em nosso diretório &lt;code&gt;pages&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/**

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;serveFile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;filePath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;readFileSync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;__dirname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;pages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;index.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;readFileSync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;__dirname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;pages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;parsedPath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;notFound&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;readFileSync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;__dirname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;pages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;404.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;404&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;notFound&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;requestListener&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;IncomingMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ServerResponse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;serveFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;writeHead&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;server&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createServer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;requestListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;server&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3030&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Agora qualquer estrutura de pastas que for criada sob o diretório &lt;code&gt;pages&lt;/code&gt; pode ser servido como uma url. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cgibin-e-php"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  cgi-bin e PHP
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Provavelmente vai ter uma pessoa que começou a ler a parte sobre arquivos estáticos e começou a pensar:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E PHP? Ele usa o Apache que é um web server mas ele não tem paginas estáticas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No caso do PHP ele modifica o webserver (não sei se já vem incluso hoje em dia) para chamar uma aplicação que vai gerar o html que ele vai servir. O webserver ainda está servido paginas estáticas mas a cada request uma pagina nova é gerada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Com cgi-bin é a mesma coisa, você chama um script que gera a pagina baseada nos parâmetros que você passou para o script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Se fossemos adicionar algo que emulasse um cgi-bin em nosso webserver precisaríamos fazer o seguinte: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Criar uma pasta para os scripts. Vamos chamar a pasta de &lt;code&gt;scripts&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depois adicionar o primeiro script em JavaScript que imprima um html.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// scripts/cgi-bin-test.js&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;html lang="en"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Document&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;cgi-bin example&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agora adicionamos o código para chamar o script no nosso webserver
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;execSync&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;child_process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kr"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Buffer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;notFound&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;notFound&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;readFileSync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;__dirname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;pages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;404.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;404&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;notFound&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;server&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createServer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;requestListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;server&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3030&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#reverse-proxy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Reverse Proxy
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agora como que conseguimos usar um webserver com outas linguagens que não se integram com o webserver, tipo Java ou C#? Você não quer ficar chamando um &lt;code&gt;.jar&lt;/code&gt; ou &lt;code&gt;.dll&lt;/code&gt; toda hora, e essas linguagens possuem &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nesse caso podemos utilizar um Reverse Proxy. O trabalho do proxy é receber os requests e repassar eles para a aplicação correta. Esse tipo de proxy é muito utilizado quando você tem varias aplicações no mesmo servidor. Você pode redirecionar baseado em informações como:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;headers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;url&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;domínio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cookies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outra vantagem do proxy reverso é que você reduz o numero de portas expostas em seu servidor já que nesse caso você pode ter múltiplas aplicações acessíveis através da porta 80 e 443&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;+------------------------------------------+
| Server A                 +-:3031-+       |
|                    +-----| APP 1 |       |
|     +-:80---+      |     +-------+       |
|     | Proxy |------+                     |
|     +-:443--+      |     +-:3032-+       |
|                    +-----| APP 2 |       |
|                          +-------+       |
+------------------------------------------+

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Como pode se ver no "diagrama" acima, temos um servidor rodando duas aplicações expondo as portas 80 e 443 que são para HTTP e HTTPS e conectando em duas aplicações. Nesse caso as portas 3031 e 3032 não precisam ser exposta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E se quisermos fazer um reverse proxy para ir com o nosso webserver?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A primeira coisa é que temos que fazer requests para o nosso webserver, então vamos implementar um cliente http
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// src/http-client.ts&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kr"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;GetResultProps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kr"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;GetProps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;callback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;GetResultProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;callback&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;GetProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;port&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;chunk&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;chunk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;callback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;statusCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agora implementamos o proxy como um webserver, mas ao invés de ler arquivos ele vai fazer um request para o webserver.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./http-client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/**
 * Cria um mapeamento de uma rota para uma porta.
 * Nesse caso esperamos que todas as rotas serão mapeadas localmente
 */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;portMap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Record&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/blog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3030&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;requestListener&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;IncomingMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ServerResponse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#refactor-time"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Refactor Time
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eu fiz algumas alterações no código para ficar mais fácil de usa-lo. Algumas das coisas que mudei:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adicionei classes para o Webserver e LoadBalancer para ficar mais simples de configurar outras instancias.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adicionei a opção de passar a porta do webserver como argumento quando rodando pelo &lt;code&gt;yarn webserver &amp;lt;porta&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#load-balancer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Load Balancer
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talvez você não tenha varias aplicações rodando em uma maquina, muito pelo contrario, um misero servidor não é o suficiente para a sua aplicação, você criou a próxima rede social de fake news e o sucesso está cobrando o seu preço.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Como ter varias maquinas rodando uma aplicação tudo através do mesmo endpoint? Você já sabe que um proxy reverso poderia fazer isso, mas tem um problema. O proxy reverso direciona baseado em algum valor do request logo ele não funcionaria corretamente.&lt;br&gt;
É ai que entra os Load Balancers, eles funcionam como um proxy reverso mas ao invés de utilizar as informações do request para definir para qual servidor ele vai redirecionar ele usa outro tipo de informação para redirecionar para um servidor contendo a aplicação. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Então vamos começar escrevendo o Load Balancer sem nenhuma estratégia de balanceamento.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;IncomingMessage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;GetResultProps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../http-client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kr"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Backend&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kr"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Strategy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;getServer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Backend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onConnectionClose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;backend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Backend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;LoadBalancer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;readonly&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;readonly&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;strategy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Strategy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;requestListener&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;IncomingMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ServerResponse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;backend&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;strategy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getServer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;callback&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;GetResultProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Enviando request para &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;backend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;server&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createServer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;requestListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;server&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kr"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;makeRequest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;backend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Backend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;originalRequest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;IncomingMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;callback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;GetResultProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;originalRequest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;originalRequest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;backend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;backend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;callback&lt;/span&gt; 
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A partir desse código podemos começar a implementar nossas estratégias. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#estrat%C3%A9gias-de-balanceamento"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Estratégias de Balanceamento
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Para balancear a carga entre os servidores, os Load Balancers vem com varias estratégias de balanceamento, Aqui temos algumas das mais usadas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#round-robin"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Round Robin
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Qual seria a coisa mais fácil a se fazer para distribuir os requests entre as maquinas? Que tal você mandar um request para cada maquina sequencialmente? Round Robin é basicamente isso, o Load Balancer manda um request para cada servidor listado no Load Balancer em forma sequencial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Para implementar o balanceamento com Round Robin é bem simples:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;RoundRobin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Strategy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kr"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; 

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;readonly&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;backends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Backend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getServer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Backend&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;backends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;backends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;    
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Agora iniciamos o LoadBalancer com ele&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Na porta 3031 e 3032 está rodando o webserver.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;roundRobin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;RoundRobin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3031&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3032&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;LoadBalancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3030&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;roundRobin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#least-connections"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Least Connections
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Você deve estar pensando que Round Robin é um algoritmo bem simplista. E sim, se as conexões em um servidor ficarem ativas por muito tempo em um servidor e o Load Balancer continuar enviando conexões o seu servidor vai acabar sobrecarregado e vai cair. Então uma maneira de resolver esse problema é configurar o Load Balancer para enviar os requests para o servidor que tem menos conexões ativas. O Load Balancer sabe qual é o servidor porque ele mantem a conexão aberta até receber uma resposta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A implementação da estratégia do Least Connections seria assim:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;LeastConnections&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Strategy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/**
     * Cria um mapa com o numero de conexoes em cada backend
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kr"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;readonly&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;connections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Backend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;backends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Backend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;backends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Não é possivel criar uma estratégia sem backends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

       &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;connections&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="nx"&gt;backends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;backend&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;connections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;backend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getServer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Backend&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;backend&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;pickLeastConnectedBackend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;connections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;backend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;connections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;backend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;backend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;backend&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;selectedBackend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;LoadBalancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3030&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;leastConnections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Agora para testar isso precisamos de uma maneira em que um dos webservers fique esperando, podemos fazer isso criando um novo script pro &lt;code&gt;cgi-bin&lt;/code&gt; que vai esperar 10 segundos antes de responder.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// scripts/sleep.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;milliseconds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;milliseconds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;html lang="en"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Document&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Sleep Example&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;E adicionamos o script no nosso webserver&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;webserver&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Webserver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;rootFolder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;__dirname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;pages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;cgiBinRootFolder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;__dirname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;scripts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;cgiBinMapping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/cgi-bin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;cgi-bin-test.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;sleep.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;webserver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Agora se você for em seu navegador e em uma aba acessar &lt;code&gt;[localhost:3030/sleep](http://localhost:3030/sleep)&lt;/code&gt; e em outra aba acessar &lt;code&gt;[localhost:3030/blog/webserver.html](http://localhost:3030/blog/webserver.html)&lt;/code&gt; e ficar atualizando a pagina você verá que todos os requests para &lt;code&gt;/blog/webserver.html&lt;/code&gt; estão indo para o servidor na porta 3032 pois a porta 3031 já tem um request. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#weighted-round-robin"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Weighted Round Robin
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nem sempre os servidores que você vai distribuir as aplicações são iguais, você pode ter um servidor bom top da NASA e um Athlon 64 com 2 Gb de ram. Você sabe qual dos servidores deve receber mais requests. Nesse caso você pode usar uma estratégia chamada Weighted, que você pode atribuir um peso para o servidor e o Load Balancer vai dar preferencia ao servidores mais pesados.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cada Load Balancer pode ter um algoritmo ou maneira diferente de atribuir o peso, mas para fins de entendermos como esse algoritmo funcionaria vamos pensar que temos 3 servidores. Um servidor maior e outros dois menores, os dois menores possuem a mesma configuração e você quer que o servidor maior receba metade dos requests.&lt;br&gt;
Metade dos requests seria 50% (espero não estar errado), os outros 50% queremos dividir entre as duas maquinas, o que seria 25%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logo configuraríamos nosso Load Balancer assim:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Strategy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Backend&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./strategy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;WeightedBackend&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Backend&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;WeightedRoundRobin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3031&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3032&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;80&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Agora como o nosso Load Balancer pode enviar os requests considerando o peso de cada maquina? Bem nossa configuração soma um total de 100%. Então vamos remover a porcentagem para facilitar e só utilizar o 100. Você pode criar um array com 100 valores e distribuir os servidores nesse array baseado no peso. O resultado seria algo assim:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    0         1      2..48     49       50       51...73    74     75      76...98    99
[server1, server1, ..., ..., server1, server2, ..., ..., server2, server3, ..., ..., server3 ]

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Agora cada request recebido pelo Load Balancer um servidor é selecionado sequencialmente no array e quando chega no fim é só voltar para o inicio do array e continuar assim enquanto receber algum request. É claro que esse algoritmo é bem ingênuo e tem muito espaço para otimização, mas não é isso que queremos aqui. O objetivo é ver como a porta &lt;code&gt;3032&lt;/code&gt; toma a maior parte do array e ira receber metade dos requests como esperado. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Para nossa implementação nós vamos fazer algo que precisa de menos espaço na memória e que seja um pouco mais tranquilo de configurar. Essa implementação permite você passar qualquer valor acima de 0 para o weight:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Strategy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Backend&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./strategy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;WeightedBackend&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Backend&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;WeightedRoundRobin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Strategy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;readonly&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;backends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;WeightedBackend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;readonly&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;totalWeight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/**
     * Transforma a propriedade weight do backend em um valor sequencial somando com valor anterior 
     * E calcula o peso total para utilizarmos como valor maximo do indice
     * @param backends WeightedBackend[]

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;backends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;WeightedBackend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;backends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;backends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;backend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

               &lt;span class="k"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Weight tem que ser maior que 0, valor atual: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;backend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

           &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
               &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;backend&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
               &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                   &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;backend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                   &lt;span class="na"&gt;weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;backend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;weight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;backends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;weight&lt;/span&gt;
               &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

       &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;totalWeight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;backends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;acc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;backend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;acc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;backend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getServer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Backend&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;totalWeight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/**
         * Seleciona o backend em que o indice esteja dentro do weight 
         */&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;backends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;acc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;backend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;acc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;weight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;backend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;backend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;acc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;    

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onConnectionClose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;backend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Backend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Agora basta você fazer 30 requests para o Load Balancer e ver para qual servidor ele vai. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#resource-based"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Resource Based:
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Para encerrarmos temos o Resource Based, que vai checar a utilização de recursos de cada servidor, isso pode ser feito através de uma aplicação instalada no servidor aonde o Load Balancer fica observando os valores ou até mesmo por endpoints em http que são disponibilizados por quem opera o servidor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eu não vou implementar esse porque seria muito trabalho. Mas acredito que agora você deve ter uma ideia de como deve funcionar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#n%C3%A3o-%C3%A9-s%C3%B3-isso"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Não é só isso
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;É claro, há muitos outros tipos de algoritmos só que esses são os principais. Se você quiser saber mais sobre isso a Wikipedia em inglês tem uma lista de algoritmos. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#norvana"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Norvana
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A verdade é que quando estamos trabalhando com uma aplicação web nós precisamos combinar todas as funcionalidades que nós vimos para termos sistemas que são escaláveis e seguros. A maior parte dos softwares que fazem isso eles todas as funções juntas. Então nós temos que fazer o mesmo com o nosso código, precisamos unir todas as tribos assim como o Norvana fez.&lt;br&gt;

    &lt;span class="na"&gt;rootFolder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;__dirname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;pages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;cgiBinRootFolder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;__dirname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;scripts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;cgiBinMapping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/cgi-bin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;cgi-bin-test.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;sleep.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;reverseProxy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;matcher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/^&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;blog/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3031&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;strategy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Você também pode ver a versão refatorada no repositório. Agora para testar essa monstruosidade você pode seguir os passos:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abra três terminais&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inicie um webserver na porta 3031 em um dos terminais&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inicia um webserver na porta 3032 em outro terminal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;E no terminal livre você pode iniciar o Norvana&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agora todos os requests para &lt;code&gt;/blog/webserver.html&lt;/code&gt; ira pelo reverse proxy e load balancer, você pode notar isso através dos logs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agora os requests para &lt;code&gt;/cgi-bin&lt;/code&gt; e &lt;code&gt;/sleep&lt;/code&gt; serão servidos como um webserver pelo o &lt;code&gt;norvana&lt;/code&gt; mesmo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#api-gateway"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  API Gateway
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Por fim nós temos API Gateways, que pode ser considerado o pièce de entrée (eu juro que isso é um termo real, tipo pièce de résistance, mas nesse caso é a peça de entrada) no mundo da plataformização e microserviços. Quando você começa a criar muitos serviços coisas que antes eram mais triviais de se lidar começam a ficar mais complexo. Então algo que era implementado uma vez em um monólito tem que ser implementado para cada serviço, coisas como autenticação, autorização e limites de uso tem que ser implementado múltiplas vezes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uma ideia que pode vir a cabeça é implementar uma biblioteca que faça isso, só que bibliotécas não são tão simples assim, você ainda tem que escrever o código de integração e também você tem que manter a biblioteca em todas as aplicações, imagine se você tem mais de 1500 serviços assim como o &lt;a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/monzo-microservices/"&gt;Monzo&lt;/a&gt; na Inglaterra. Uma mudança na API da biblioteca pode causar grandes problemas de migração.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Então para resolver isso esse tipo de código é movido para outro lugar, nos exemplos que dei todos são coisas que queremos fazer antes de processar qualquer request, logo podemos mover isso para a entrada da plataforma. E o que temos na entrada da plataforma nesse caso? Bem provavelmente um proxy reverso, um web server ou balanceador de carga. Mas no caso deles nós nos preocupamos apenas em servir os requests, a unica lógica involvida é para saber qual servidor deve receber o request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;É ai que entra o API Gateway, ele serve para dar uma camada extra de lógica aonde podemos agrupar operações comuns que não estão relacionadas ao negócio em um único ponto. Agora todos os requests que chegam aos serviços já estão devidamente validados.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#s%C3%ADndrome-de-n%C3%A3o-inventado-aqui"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Síndrome de Não Inventado Aqui
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A internet é um lugar perigoso, todas as ruas da internet tem dois caras numa moto esperando para você dar um vacilo. Nós implementamos algumas coisas aqui, você pode olhar e pensar "Isso não é tão difícil" esse tipo de pensamento chamado de Síndrome de Não Inventado Aqui aonde as pessoas acham que elas tem que desenvolver todo software que eles vão rodar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isso é um problema sério, qualquer software de infra-estrutura pode parecer simple mas na hora de implementar os detalhes e fazer o software seguro as coisas ficam muito difíceis. Então se um dia você se ver implementando qualquer uma das coisas que vemos aqui para colocar em produção e você não trabalhar para uma empresa de infra-estrutura, pare e procure ajuda.&lt;/p&gt;
