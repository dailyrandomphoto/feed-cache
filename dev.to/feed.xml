      <title>What to expect from Java interview in 2021</title>
      <author>Pavel Polívka</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/pavel_polivka/what-to-expect-from-java-interview-in-2021-275j</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my previous job, I did a lot of interviews for our Java developer positions. We had a typical modern Java stack based on Spring framework and relational database. We usually hired junior devs right after school so our interview process was designed to find talented people with potential, not encyclopedical knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had one in-person round and take a home coding assignment. This article will try to cover both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#inperson-round"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  In-person round
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the more important round of our process. Basically usually a team lead of the team that was hiring and one senior dev was conducting it. The goal was to determine if the person would be a good fit for a team, had some technical thinking capabilities and the most important could communicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first part, we had a small talk portion, that was around previous experiences, either their current job or a school project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typical questions here would be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What was the last project you worked on?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What have you learned recently?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What would be your dream project?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second part we did few technical questions. Around some basic Java or Spring things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typical questions here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explain static keyword.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explain how to compare objects in Java. Equals and hasCode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inversion of control and dependency injection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the third part, we had a technical challenge to solve. It was a simplified real problem we had to solve during last year (we were changing this to keep it interesting). It did not have one solution. Involved designing a simple alghoritm that strongly suggested use of recursion, but could be solved numerous ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal was to for the candidate to design a data structructure and use it in the simple alghoritm. We wanted  candidate to communicate what they are doing and we usually helped them talk through everything. We never looked at the syntax or cared what language they used. We wnated to see the capabilities to design the structure to store the data and some basic thinking to see of they at least were able to talk through what should be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last part we gave space for any questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#take-a-home-coding-challenge"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Take a home coding challenge
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a very easy take a home coding challenge that was basically to implement CSV parser. Parse data in the CSV we provided and print it as HTML table and excel file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We looked at theese concepts in the final code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polymorphism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Library usage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unit testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did not require a perfect solution, we even did recomend to implement as much as they are feel like and then just write comments explainging how to finish it. We did not had a time constrain and ultimate goal here was to see if the candidate would be able to write code at our standards.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Hope this article helped you can always ask me about anytihng on my &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pavel_polivka"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>6 Ways To Make Money With Your Code</title>
      <author>Mark Vassilevskiy</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2021 17:47:57 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/abstract/6-ways-to-make-money-with-your-code-3jk7</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/abstract/6-ways-to-make-money-with-your-code-3jk7</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many of us know what "Coding" is and maybe some of you've built really cool projects and have many years of practice, however, not everybody knows how to really make money from your code. I tried to find the best ways how to do it, some of them I used myself and some of them not, but actually, everybody can highlight something from this top.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-freelancing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Freelancing
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freelancing is one of the most popular ways of doing money, if you know something well enough (Coding, Photoshoping, or Editing) then you can easily present your services. It is directly proportional to how much effort you put into this. There are many platforms to start accepting orders from other people, for instance: Upwork, Fiverr and etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cons"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cons:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competitive Environment, you need to put really much effort to be better than other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you're new at this niche most likely that customers just won't notice you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pluses"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Pluses:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As I said earlier, is it directly proportional to how much effort you put into this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The more positive feedback you have the more you be popular and earn more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-creating%C2%A0courses"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Creating Courses
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll show you how profitable can it be, there's a course of Python - "2021 Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python" and it has over 1.2 million students, which means that even with the lowest price (11.99$) the founder with of this course will earn more than 14 million dollars. You can tutor other 1 to 1 or create a course on Udemy as I've shown earlier. I think you get the idea, now let's look at the minuses and pluses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cons"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cons:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to know something really good to teach others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe it will require any attachments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pluses"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Pluses:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As you saw only in one example, you can make a really big sum of money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's really useful because when you teach someone you understand it better yourself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-start-a%C2%A0blog"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Start a Blog
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can do it anywhere and anytime, It doesn't matter where you want to start a blog. For example, I write articles on Medium like - "12 VSCode Extensions That Every Developer Should Use", "Simple Commands In Linux that will Make You Feel Like a Pro", "JavaScript Tips to Improve Your Webpage Performance" and even the one you are reading now. You can start YouTube Channel and shoot videos about programming or something else that you're good at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cons"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cons:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will have to fight your way through countless other YouTubers like you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In order for people to come to your channel, you must take care of the design, sound quality, and image itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pluses"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Pluses:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who didn't want to become a famous YouTuber? or who didn't want to sit at home and earn millions of dollars? I guess you got me right&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-make-your%C2%A0startup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Make Your Startup
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, I think it's the most difficult at this top, but also the most lucrative. Look at such companies as Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, and many others. These were just startups by some group of reckless programmers that became the biggest companies in the world. I'm not telling you to become a new Steve Jobs, I'm just saying that you can make your small business of an idea that you or someone else invented and have Really good money from it. It doesn't matter what will it be, a simple app that helps people to navigate better or something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cons"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cons:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to invest money and time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to be good not only at programming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You'll probably need a team because without it team it will much harder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe many attempts will fail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pluses"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Pluses:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can build whatever you want
the path that brings you the most money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-plugins-for-wordpress"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Plugins For WordPress
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't know, WordPress is the most popular platform for creating sites without actually knowing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Actually, everyone uses plugins for it, and as you've might notice you can create your own plugin and have a passive income from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cons"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cons:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To create a plugin that will get layout website easier you need to know how to build sites yourself and not only&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pluses"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Pluses:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can create plugins with no restrictions and it will bring you more money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passive Income&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-bots-for%C2%A0discord"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. Bots for Discord
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have ever been on the Discord server that I'm pretty sure that there were many bots that have different functionality, for example, some of them are for music playback, some if for better managing member's messages, and some of them just for fun. If you've made really great bot that solves specific problems then you can easily sell it on Freelance Sites which I talked about earlier or somehow differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cons"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cons:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should know several libraries for it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pluses"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Pluses:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's fun!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These were 6 ways to earn money from your coding and not only. Some of them I've been using over several years and some of them only want to start. I hope that you highlighted something for you :) You can contact me at Discord: MarkFusion#2903&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>9 VSCode Extensions You Definitely Need As A Developer</title>
      <author>Mark Vassilevskiy</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2021 17:39:07 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/abstract/9-vscode-extensions-you-definitely-need-as-a-developer-2e89</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/abstract/9-vscode-extensions-you-definitely-need-as-a-developer-2e89</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;These extensions will help you improve your workflow if you use VSCode every day, as I do, and make it far better than it is currently. I’ve been using them for a long time and can recommend them. I’m confident you’ll discover your ideal one because these extensions provide a variety of important functionalities and make your IDE more attractive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I especially enjoy programming in JavaScript and can’t imagine what I would do without these extensions. I searched the internet for the most recent and greatest extensions and these are the best ones in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#bracket-pair-colorizer-2"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Bracket Pair Colorizer 2
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose you’ve been in a situation where you couldn’t find where one bracket starts and where another ends. Or maybe it’s hard to understand the structure of the function, and you’ve lost the scope. If you can relate to these situations, then Bracket Pair Colorizer 2 will definitely help you out. It works with the usual brackets, square brackets, and parentheses.&lt;br&gt;
The main difference between this and the first versions is that the second is a little faster and more accurate. Actually, this extension will help you to stay focused and not confuse you every time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dNJTwyPi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tnkio5s5lbcg95qnro8y.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dNJTwyPi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tnkio5s5lbcg95qnro8y.png" alt="Image description" width="700" height="553"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#kite"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Kite
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine you’re writing a line and don’t even have to end it because Kite will do it for you. All you need to do is to tap the TAB button, and it will automatically complete your code. I personally love Kite since it helps me code much faster. Also, it will show you the errors which you might make while typing. After installing Kite into your VSCode, it will ask you to download an app to your computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you prefer not to use Kite for some reason, then you can install Visual Studio IntelliCode or JavaScript (ES6) code snippets. The main difference between Kite and other almost similar extensions is that they’re mostly working only with one language, whereas Kite works almost with every programming language and also uses upgraded AI for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--oiVKlG82--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/64eiuezxappns9zeckr9.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--oiVKlG82--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/64eiuezxappns9zeckr9.gif" alt="Image description" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#code-spell-checker"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Code Spell Checker
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you didn’t listen to the Kite’s Advise and typed the name of the function incorrectly, then Code Spell Checker will instantly show you where you should change something. And, of course, it will say to you what words in your comments don’t seem to be grammatically right&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QMM2Al5y--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9966dd57f9h8yb016s00.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QMM2Al5y--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9966dd57f9h8yb016s00.png" alt="Image description" width="" height=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prettier"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Prettier
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prettier does exactly what it says. It makes your code pretty and also more readable. It has many parameters that will bring your coding to the next level of comfort. For example, you won’t ever need to count the number of spaces or think about where to place your brackets — it will do everything for you, and you don’t need to do anything manually. Also, you can use Beautify for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OO17Zu1c--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/z10ay7gsxgcl77olepr9.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OO17Zu1c--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/z10ay7gsxgcl77olepr9.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="501"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UCLStTWd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ue2waimdkcg9ja1487v6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UCLStTWd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ue2waimdkcg9ja1487v6.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#live-server"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Live Server
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This extension is especially for web developers because it allows you to not reload your page after editing your code. By using Live Server, you can press the button “Go Live” at the bottom of your screen, and every change will automatically apply to your web page. I personally love this extension, and it saves me a ton of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--b5Xkuxem--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ivntpfro442sdyrvvizh.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--b5Xkuxem--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ivntpfro442sdyrvvizh.gif" alt="Image description" width="" height=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#path-intellisense"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Path Intellisense
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you always forget where your image is located or you need to fill “href” and “src” tags, Path Intellisense will automatically offer you paths with which you’re currently working, and all that you need to do manually is to tap Enter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LJYqnBkH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3yarljazmsatf7udq77b.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LJYqnBkH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3yarljazmsatf7udq77b.png" alt="Image description" width="700" height="399"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#material-icon-theme"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Material Icon Theme
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever been working instantly with three files or more, for example, making a website almost every time requires moving through all files, it can be hard to understand where the HTML file or JavaScript file is. Material Icon Theme will certainly make this type of task much easier for you. It adds many visual icons for every file that you’re currently using. As always, it’s my personal choice and you can install another “Icon Theme”. It has icons for almost every file, and I’ll show you a some of them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RdPfYdLn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6to2d8ir87hdvup2qk8w.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RdPfYdLn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6to2d8ir87hdvup2qk8w.png" alt="Image description" width="700" height="787"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#one-dark-pro"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  One Dark Pro
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m the type of person who can’t just use the default VSCode design theme, and I personally use One Dark Pro to make my code prettier and enjoyable for my eyes. You can set up everything to what you want, for instance, change the font size or make everything in italic style. It’s one of the most popular solutions for most people. However, you can easily use other extensions such as Atom Theme or even something like Dracula Official.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AicIeBO6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9srbfxj9xv4cly3j733s.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AicIeBO6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9srbfxj9xv4cly3j733s.png" alt="Image description" width="700" height="522"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#discord-presence"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Discord Presence
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest extension, which I added just for fun. Discord Presence works with Discord, and when you’re coding, it will display your Discord status, and your friends can easily see when they can interrupt you and when they shouldn’t. Also, you can track the time of your coding because it shows in Discord too.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is it critical to keep the list of VSCode extensions up to date on a regular basis? Because VSCode updates can sometimes include extensions like Auto Close Tag or Auto Rename Tag that are installed by default (you don’t have to do it manually).&lt;br&gt;
I hope you enjoyed this article; I attempted to identify the best extensions across the entire VSCode Marketplace, and like I mentioned before, I included several extensions that I’ve personally used for a long time.&lt;br&gt;
If you have any questions or suggestions, or if you’d like to see extensions for a certain topic like Python, please leave a comment, and I’ll be sure to read and address it. You can contact me at Discord: MarkFusion#2903&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The revolution in Front-end Development is here</title>
      <author>vsblox</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2021 17:34:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/bruceblox/the-revolution-in-front-end-development-is-here-13a6</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, &lt;br&gt;
I’m Bruce and I’m a DevRel at blox. Me and my team are excited to bring you the alpha release of &lt;a href="https://www.vsblox.com/"&gt;blox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-blox"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is blox?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;blox is a VS code extension that lets you drop code snippets with a single click. It’s aimed at fast tracking the developer workflow through the ease of adding pre-built UI components without ever having to leave VS Code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JwPY7UP1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1yq6k1n0ra88tl2d5m5b.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JwPY7UP1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1yq6k1n0ra88tl2d5m5b.gif" alt="blox vscode demo" width="880" height="440"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-blox-story"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The blox story
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started using Tailwind CSS a couple years ago, I fell in love with the ease and seamlessness of the experience that comes with it. As someone who was managing a team of quite a few devs at that time, I started noticing the need to fast track our workflow as our clientele grew. We gave more than a couple of UI kits/libraries (for Tailwind CSS) a shot and we were over the moon with the difference they made, in the form of quicker dev hand-offs. &lt;br&gt;
As time passed, I started pondering over the fact that we were spending too much time switching over windows, setting up frameworks, and applying configs for the UI components of the excellent resources we were using. &lt;br&gt;
Then one day in the midst of a caffeine rush, I had a crazy yet simple idea that what if I could skip the copy-pasting and just do everything where I spend most of my time. I ran some ideas over with my team in the next Monday's meeting. And after spending a week or so on coming up with a product development strategy we went right into it. &lt;br&gt;
I’ll dive deep into our product development journey and the ups and downs of building blox some other time. For now, I just wanted to share a glimpse of our journey and how we got here.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#integrations-and-supported-frameworks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Integrations and supported frameworks
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, blox supports Tailwind CSS with Angular, Vue, and React at the moment. In the future, we have plans of gradually releasing support for MaterialUI, Bootstrap, Svelte, Alpine.js, and Laravel. Blox comes with an extensive code snippets library of more than 1500 codeblocks for a wide collection of categories. There are three component categories of Web Application UI, Ecommerce UI, and Marketing UI for fully functional and responsive web applications, landing pages, and web stores. There are a bunch of component categories that are built by expert designers after an extensive UX research. We’ve arranged the code block in an intuitive way &lt;br&gt;
The code blocks require no configuration, and they’re also completely functional and responsive. So, once you’ve installed blox, you’re all set and good to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#try-blox"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Try blox
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently we’re doing a soft launch  and you can install the alpha version of blox from its VSIX file. It’s available on &lt;a href="https://www.vsblox.com/"&gt;blox's official website&lt;/a&gt;. Once you install it in your VS code, the “b” (blox) icon appears on the left side, along with your other installed extensions. Just open it up and start dropping the code blocks in your projects!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tU8L_NSW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/koj09v7tc1nik1usvkjq.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tU8L_NSW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/koj09v7tc1nik1usvkjq.gif" alt="blox vscode demo 2" width="880" height="440"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HTML Cheatsheet</title>
      <author>Mursal Furqan</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/mursalfk/html-cheatsheet-3n8b</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My journey from Back-End Python developer to a Front-End React Developer was not a piece of cake. I have a long way since I joined my first job at &lt;a href="https://diyainteractive.com/"&gt;Diya Interactive&lt;/a&gt; back in Feb, 2021. I have started from the scratch my Front-End journey, and I am still learning.&lt;br&gt;
Based on my own personal learning experience, I have prepared a list of most widely used HTML Tags, that you should know of, if you want to pursue a career as a Front-End Developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#html-basic-structure"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  HTML Basic Structure
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; Defines the document type&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; Defines an HTML Document&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; Contains the metadata/information for the document&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;meta&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; Defines a title for the document&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; Defines the document's body&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!--&lt;/code&gt;...&lt;code&gt;--&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; Defines a comment in HTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;hr&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; Defines a thematic change in the content with a horizontal rule/line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; Inserts a single line break&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#styles-and-semantics"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Styles and Semantics
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; Defines style information for a document&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; Defines a section in a document&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; Defines a section in a document on the same line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;header&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; Defines a header for the document or the section&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;footer&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; Defines a footer for the document or the section&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;main&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; Specifies the main content of the document&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;section&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; Defines a section in a document with references to other elements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;article&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; Defines an article&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lists"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Lists
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; Defines an unordered list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; Defines an ordered list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; Defines a list item in both, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;dl&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; Provides a description to the list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;dt&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; Gives a term/name to the description list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;dd&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; Defines a description of a term/name in a description list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--awaBNtIE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://memegenerator.net/img/instances/65123091.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--awaBNtIE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://memegenerator.net/img/instances/65123091.jpg" alt="Bore Meme" width="640" height="480"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope I didn't bore you with all this 😉&lt;br&gt;
Next time, we will be covering the basic elements you NEEEEEEEEEED to know about &lt;strong&gt;Forms &amp;amp; Inputs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to share with the community the source code of a fullstack web application that I have just developed using MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS) stack demonstrating basic features of a bookstore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this would be a good resource for anyone who enjoys learning Javascript in general and MERN stack in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The live demo is accessible at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bn-bookstore.herokuapp.com/#/"&gt;https://bn-bookstore.herokuapp.com/#/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frontend and Backend source code is available at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/linhtch90/bn_bookstore_public_source"&gt;https://github.com/linhtch90/bn_bookstore_public_source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy coding and if this is useful for you, please give me a Github star for encouragement!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Join Us for the 2021 GitHub Actions Hackathon on DEV!</title>
      <author>Gracie Gregory (she/her)</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2021 17:11:21 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/devteam/join-us-for-the-2021-github-actions-hackathon-on-dev-4hn4</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/devteam/join-us-for-the-2021-github-actions-hackathon-on-dev-4hn4</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the second year in a row, GitHub will be hosting the "GitHub Actions Hackathon" right here on DEV!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From now until December 8th, GitHub is offering an unmissable opportunity to utilize GitHub Actions to benefit open source in exchange for prizes. All participants will need to share a DEV post detailing how they created their amazing workflow with GitHub Actions. We can't wait to see what you create!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read on for more details about GitHub Actions and how you can join the hackathon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-are-github-actions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What Are GitHub Actions?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/features/actions"&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/a&gt; are individual tasks that allow you to automate and customize your software development workflows. Actions are located in the same place you store code, collaborate with peers, solve issues, and ship open source software — GitHub! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this year’s hackathon, we’re encouraging participants to utilize existing GitHub Actions to create workflows that make sense in the real world. While you are free to create a new Action, the emphasis of this contest is to create practical and interesting solutions other developers can utilize to solve problems with open source. We hope you’ll walk away with a greater understanding of the value of GitHub Actions — for you and the open source community. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to see how you approach this challenge. &lt;a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions"&gt;More on GitHub Actions here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#categories"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Categories
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The GitHub Actions Hackathon is calling for projects in these categories:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Maintainer Must-Haves:&lt;/strong&gt; make the lives of open source maintainers easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;DIY Deployments:&lt;/strong&gt; improve the deployment process for open source projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Interesting IoT:&lt;/strong&gt; cool projects that integrate with IoT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Phone Friendly:&lt;/strong&gt; workflows built for Mobile (PWA readiness, iOS/Android)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Wacky Wildcards:&lt;/strong&gt; anything that doesn’t fit in the above category (note, truly wacky submissions are encouraged)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-participate"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why Participate?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the momentum of Hacktoberfest last month, we wanted to emphasize GitHub Actions are a perfect open source access point. They allow you to create helpful and logical workflows for your everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We also think the prizes on offer make for a pretty compelling case to participate in the GitHub Actions Hackathon 2021 😉&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prizes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Prizes
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 Grand Prize Winners&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (one in each category):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$1,500 USD gift card or equivalent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$300 USD credit to the DEV Shop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GitHub Swag Pack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DEV Sticker Pack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DEV “Actions Hackathon 2021” grand prize winner badge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Runner-Up Prizes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (10 Total):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$250 USD gift card or equivalent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$150 USD credit to the DEV Shop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GitHub Swag Pack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DEV Sticker Pack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DEV “Actions Hackathon 2021” runner-up badge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DEV Sticker Pack&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will show you how to deploy code to a live server easily with Git.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say you have already &lt;a href="https://dev.to/brandonwallace/deploy-flask-the-easy-way-with-gunicorn-and-nginx-jgc"&gt;deployed your project&lt;/a&gt; to a live server. A few days later you receive valuable feedback on your project from another developer. You decide to make some improvements to the project. You work in your local Git repository to make the changes. You test everything to make sure it is working the way you intended it to work. Then you commit the changes in your code to your local Git repository. Then you push those changes to Github.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you go about getting those improvements to the live server? Would you log into the server and meticulously edit the file manually?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an easy way to deploy code to a live server - use Git. All you need it is the ability to SSH to the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the syntax for the git push command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git push &amp;lt;repository&amp;gt; &amp;lt;branch_name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git push origin main
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;origin&lt;/code&gt; is first repository that is set up and usually represents the repository connected to the Github website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get code to a live server, I will create a second repository on the live server to push code to. I will call the second repository "prod" to represent the repository on the live production server. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After pushing code to the "origin" repository I will be able to push to "prod" any code ready for production. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I am ready to push code to the production server I run this command.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git push prod main
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#on-the-server"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  On the server
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#set-up-a-repository-on-the-server"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Set up a repository on the server.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step to set this up is to create a bare repository on the web server where you will run the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SSH to your server. My server has the user &lt;code&gt;brandon&lt;/code&gt; and the IP address &lt;code&gt;123.45.67.89&lt;/code&gt;. So I use this command.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;ssh brandon@123.45.67.89
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Create a directory for the project.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo mkdir /var/www/my_project_repo/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Set the permissions on the directory.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo chown $USER:$USER /var/www/my_project_repo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then move into the directory like this.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ cd /var/www/my_project_repo/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Create the directory for the actual project with a &lt;code&gt;.git&lt;/code&gt; extension.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo mkdir my_project.git/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Move into the "my_project.git" directory.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ cd my_project.git/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Set up the directory as a Git bare repository.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git init --bare
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The directory structure should look like this.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ tree --dirsfirst -F
.

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-a-hook-to-perform-an-action"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating a hook to perform an action.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hook will allow you to run a script when a particular action occurs. There are hooks that run on the client and hooks that run on the server. I will set up the server-side hook &lt;code&gt;post-receive&lt;/code&gt; that will run once a git push has finished executing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a file called &lt;code&gt;post-receive&lt;/code&gt; in the hooks directory.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ touch hooks/post-receive
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Use any text editor to edit the post-receive file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ vim hooks/post-receive
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Add the following content, change the paths to reflect your set up.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!/bin/sh
git --work-tree=/var/www/my_project_repo/ --git-dir=/var/www/my_project_repo/my_project.git checkout -f main
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The post-receive script is not executable.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ls -lF hooks/post-receive 
-rw------- 1 brandon brandon 0 Nov  2 21:19 hooks/post-receive
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Make the script executable by running the &lt;code&gt;chmod&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ chmod +x hooks/post-receive

$ ls -lF hooks/post-receive 
-rwx------ 1 brandon brandon 0 Nov  2 21:19 hooks/post-receive*
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#on-the-client-machine"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  On the client machine
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#connect-your-local-repository-to-the-server-repository"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Connect your local repository to the server repository.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the client machine where my local repository is located I will connect that repository to the one I created on the live server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a local repository with the same name as the directory on the server minus the &lt;code&gt;.git&lt;/code&gt; extension.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ mkdir my_project/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Move into the directory.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ cd my_project/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Set up git in the project directory.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git init

$ touch .gitignore readme.md LICENSE
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Add content to the readme.md file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ echo '# My Auto Deploy Project' &amp;gt;&amp;gt; readme.md
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Add a simple index.html file to the project.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ vim index.html
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Add the following content to the index.html file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;html lang="en"&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;

    &amp;lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1" /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;meta name="description" content="My auto deploy project."&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Hello World!&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;

    &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Hello World!&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Add all the file to Git and commit the changes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git add --all

$ git commit -m "First commit"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Create a new repository on Github without the readme.md, .gitignore, or LICENSE. We have already created the typical files for a Github repository. Name the Github repository the same as the local repository. My local repository is called &lt;code&gt;my_project&lt;/code&gt; so I use the same name to create the Github repository. See screenshot below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ThytOwna--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.postimg.cc/TwFkrsDr/create-gh-repo.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ThytOwna--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.postimg.cc/TwFkrsDr/create-gh-repo.png" alt="create-gh-repo.png" width="801" height="789"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connect the local repository to Github. Make sure the branch is called &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git remote add origin git@github.com:brandon-wallace/my_project.git

$ git branch -M main
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Set &lt;code&gt;origin&lt;/code&gt; as the default repository to push to.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git push -u origin main

 * [new branch]      main -&amp;gt; main
Branch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin'.

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I have successfully connected the local repository to Github. Now I will connect the local repository to the live production server. My server has the IP address &lt;code&gt;123.45.67.89&lt;/code&gt; so I run this command with the full path to the &lt;code&gt;my_project.git&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git remote add prod brandon@123.45.67.89:/var/www/my_project_repo/my_project.git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When I want to push code to the production server. I run this command.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git push prod main

Enumerating objects: 5, done.

 * [new branch]      main -&amp;gt; main
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;View the remotes. This shows that there are two remote repositories available, &lt;code&gt;prod&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;origin&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git remote -v

prod    brandon@123.45.67.89:my_project.git (fetch)
prod    brandon@123.45.67.89:my_project.git (push)
origin  https://github.com/brandon-wallace/my_project.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/brandon-wallace/my_project.git (push)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I will make some changes to the project and push those to the production server.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ touch style.css
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Add some content to the CSS file with any text editor.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ vim sytle.css

# Example content

html {
    font-size: 100%;
}

body {
    background: #FFFFFF;
    font-family: sans-serif;
    font-weight: 400;
    line-height: 1.75;
    color: #000000;
}

h1 {
    margin-top: 0;
    font-size: 3.052rem;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Add the new CSS file. Commit the changes to the repository.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git add style.css

$ git commit -m "Add CSS file"

# Output

[main 8881680] Add CSS file
 1 files changed, 27 insertions(+), 3 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 style.css
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Right now, on the server I can see four files in &lt;code&gt;my_project_repo&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ /var/www/my_project_repo $ ls -l
total 12
-rw-r--r-- 1 brandon brandon  319 Nov  7 10:25 index.html

-rw-r--r-- 1 brandon brandon   25 Nov  7 10:25 readme.md

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Push the changes to the production server.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git push prod main

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now on the server I can see the &lt;code&gt;style.css&lt;/code&gt; I just pushed to the &lt;code&gt;prod&lt;/code&gt; repository running on the live server.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;/var/www/my_project_repo $ ls -l
total 16

-rw-r--r-- 1 brandon brandon  365 Nov  7 10:56 style.css
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#troubleshooting"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Troubleshooting
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, check carefully for spelling errors is highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you get &lt;code&gt;-bash: git: command not found&lt;/code&gt; error install &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo apt update

$ sudo apt install git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You get the error:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh: Could not resolve hostname github.com: Temporary failure in name resolution
fatal: Could not read from remote repository...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You need to set up SSH keys on Github.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
