      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In order to make the traditional Tic Tac Toe Game unbeatable, it is necessary to create an algorithm that can calculate all the possible moves available for the Computer and can use that to determine the best possible move.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q7tOsuYg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g11lt9q6iwo921v952uk.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q7tOsuYg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g11lt9q6iwo921v952uk.gif" alt="Tic Tac Toe GUI"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve games using AI, we will introduce the concept of a Game Tree followed by Minimax algorithm. This algorithm sees a few steps ahead and puts itself in the shoes of its opponent. It keeps playing ahead until it reaches a terminal arrangement of the board (terminal state) resulting in a tie, a win, or a loss. Once in a terminal state, the AI will assign an arbitrary positive score (+10) for a win, a negative score (-10) for a loss, or a neutral score (0) for a tie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the algorithm evaluates the moves that lead to a terminal state based on the players’ turn. It will choose the move with maximum score when it is the AI’s turn and choose the move with the minimum score when it is the human player’s turn. Using this strategy, Minimax avoids losing to the human player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-minimax"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Minimax?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimax&lt;/strong&gt; (sometimes MinMax, MM or saddle point) is a decision rule used in artificial intelligence, decision theory, game theory, statistics, and philosophy for minimizing the possible loss for a worst case (maximum loss) scenario. When dealing with gains, it is referred to as &lt;strong&gt;"maximin" - to maximize the minimum gain&lt;/strong&gt;. Originally formulated for n-player zero-sum game theory (one player wins (+10) and other player loses (-10) or both of anyone not to win (0)), covering both the cases where players take alternate moves and those where they make simultaneous moves, it has also been extended to more complex games and to general decision-making in the presence of uncertainty. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-does-it-work"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How does it work?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To check whether or not the current move is better than the best move we take the help of minimax function which will consider all the possible ways the game can go and returns the best value for that move, assuming the opponent also plays optimally until it finds a terminal state (win, draw or lose).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="#explanation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Explanation:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This image depicts all the possible paths that the game can take from the root board state. It is often called the Game Tree. &lt;br&gt;
The 3 possible scenarios in the above example are : &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Left Move : If X plays [2,0]. Then O will play [2,1] and win the game. The value of this move is -10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Middle Move : If X plays [2,1]. Then O will play [2,2] which draws the game. The value of this move is 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Right Move : If X plays [2,2]. Then he will win the game. The value of this move is +10;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember, even though X has a possibility of winning if he plays the middle move, O will never let that happen and will choose to draw instead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Therefore the best choice for X, is to play [2,2], which will guarantee a victory for him.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>API: Def, Types, Spec, and Docs.
A stone's throw into the application programming interface.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You don't have to be around the tech space for months before coming across the word API. Words like API shouldn't be a new thing to anyone that reads tech magazines or blog posts like what you are doing now, one thing reading of blog post and a tech magazine helps you with is getting familiar with buzzwords in the tech space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before learning web development the word API sounded like a complex term that would be difficult to understand and start running with. Over time the term has become a frequently used word, companies are now developing API as a product and creating a role for documentarians to help them organize and structure words that will enable their users to use their API without any difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got to know about the history of API after reading about it on &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/"&gt;RED HAT.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;APIs emerged in the early days of computing, well before the personal computer. At the time, an API was typically used as a library for operating systems. The API was almost always local to the systems on which it operated, although it sometimes passed messages between mainframes. After nearly 30 years, APIs broke out of their local environments. By the early 2000s, they were becoming an important technology for the remote integration of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically, API stands for Application Programming Interface. Most large companies have built APIs for their customers, or for internal use, or as a Product, as a means of collaboration between two different and remote companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-web-as-an-instance"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Web as an Instance
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about the Web as a large network of connected servers, where we make a request through HTTP and get a response that is been define in a structured way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web provides information to users from a remote server, every web page on the internet is stored somewhere on a remote server that receives request and process response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you type a web address into your browser, a request goes out to the web remote server. Once your browser receives the response, it interprets the code and displays the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#api-def"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  API Def.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the acronym is commonly referenced, few understand its actual meaning. Like we clearly stated above what the acronym represents. Understand that software is built to communicate, this is the whole essence to while most software applications are built with the integration of APIs that serve then data from other applications, it could be to communicate with a store by placing orders and check out or a bank by processing payment or transfer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software or its elements don’t need a graphical user interface to communicate with each other. Software products exchange data and functionalities via a machine-readable medium which can be likened to – Application programming interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An API is a set of programming code that enables data transmission between one software product and another. It also contains the terms of this data exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#types-of-api"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Types of API
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are severe types of APIs and some APIs are been made available base on their release policy. API release policy could be Private, Partner, and Public. For example, with Javascript API you can perform an action like While the browser usually is 'above' any code running in it, a  &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/browserSettings"&gt;Mozilla-derived API&lt;/a&gt;  allows JavaScript limited access to browser settings. Think about aspects such as reading the user's homepage, how bookmarks are handled, and where new tabs show up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#api-release-policy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  API release policy:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private&lt;/strong&gt;: These APIs are solely used within an organization and  In-house developers use these APIs to integrate a company’s IT systems or applications, build new systems or customer-facing apps leveraging existing systems. The private strategy allows a company to fully control API usage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Partner&lt;/strong&gt;: Openly promoted but available for known business partners who have signed an agreement with the publisher or the API company. The common use case for partner APIs is software integration between two parties. For example, an e-commerce platform like  &lt;a href="//www.timiun.com"&gt;Timiun&lt;/a&gt;  integrated a payment API develop and publish by  &lt;a href="https://www.mymonify.com/"&gt;Monify&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;** Public**: These types of APIs are publicly available to use like OAuth APIs from Google. It has also not given any restriction to use them. So, they are also known as Public APIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;APIs can be classified according to the systems for which they are designed. There are Database APIs that enable communication between an application and a database management system. working with databases by writing queries to access data, change tables, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web APIs provide machine-readable data and functionality transfer between web-based systems which represent client-server architecture. These APIs mainly deliver requests from web applications and responses from servers using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#api-spec"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  API Spec
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An API spec is made up of a plan of how your API should look structurally - like an architectural design of a product. The best part of an API Spec is that it enables you to isolate design flaws or problems before you write a line of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantage that comes with planning your API specification is something worth the time put in. Building your API base on specification could possibly add two or more weeks to the deadline for the development life-cycle, but it worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea behind APIs is simple, it should be flexible enough to be used by anyone and adequately documented to enter face with the developers using it. Most time thinks of API having customer support where a developer could chat up the support about the difficulties s/he could be facing integrating using the API, but this is while we have Technical writers and Documentarians I supposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#api-docs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  API Docs
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;API documentation is a technical content deliverable, containing instructions about how to effectively use and integrate with an API - Swagger.io&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As stated above, API documentation is a company's customer support system for marketing their API, so you understand how effective and the amount of effort that has been put out to have that ready for consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is easy to ready documentation but it is more fun when it is properly structured in a manner that a user can easily locate what s/he is looking out for. Most documentation teams while building the docs for their APIs are responsible for continuous maintenance of the documentation, so they basically design means of getting feedback from users on how to improve the docs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I heard someone saying "if you don't document it then it didn't happen", documentation is an art of credibility, and reading documentation carefully is an art of consistency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading !!!!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Data visualization: Using amCharts in React.js with Mojo</title>
      <author>Gaurav Rai</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Apr 2021 17:37:18 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/raigaurav/data-visualization-using-amcharts-in-react-js-with-mojo-29mh</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/raigaurav/data-visualization-using-amcharts-in-react-js-with-mojo-29mh</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my previous &lt;a href="https://dev.to/raigaurav/data-visualization-using-amcharts-with-perl-and-mojo-38ff"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, I talked about using &lt;a href="https://www.amcharts.com/"&gt;amCharts&lt;/a&gt; library with Perl &lt;a href="https://mojolicious.org/"&gt;Mojolicious&lt;/a&gt;. Today we will looking at creating the similar chart with &lt;a href="https://reactjs.org/"&gt;React.js&lt;/a&gt; instead of plain JavaScript. I will keep it short since we already talked about it previously and will be reusing most of the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 2 ways we can use the react.js -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Without JSX (using  tag)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With JSX&lt;/li&gt;


&lt;p&gt;JSX stand for JavaScript XML. It allow you to easily write HTML in react.&lt;br&gt;
For now we will take the baby step and start without JSX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-the-data-config" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating the data config
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will use the exact same example as in &lt;a href="https://dev.to/raigaurav/data-visualization-using-amcharts-with-perl-and-mojo-38ff"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; article and try to create a multi line chart.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"title"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Number of automobiles sold per day by manufacturer"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"label"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"domainAxis"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Date"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"rangeAxis"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Numbers of automobiles sold"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"data"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"Date"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"2020-04-15"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"Honda"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"Toyota"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"Ford"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"Renault"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"Date"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"2020-04-16"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"Honda"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"Date"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"2020-04-17"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"Renault"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-the-mojo-app" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating the mojo app
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The version I am using for this article is 9.14.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt; mojo generate app MojoReactApp
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This command will generate a example application with proper directory structure for a MVC application and mentioned previously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now go inside the dir and try to run this app.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;morbo ./script/mojo_app
Web application available at http://127.0.0.1:3000
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open the browser and hit &lt;a href="http://localhost:3000/"&gt;http://localhost:3000/&lt;/a&gt; and you can see the welcome page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of step is exact similar to mention in 'Creating the mojo app' section in &lt;a href="https://dev.to/raigaurav/data-visualization-using-amcharts-with-perl-and-mojo-38ff"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; article. So I will not board you by repeating it again. We will directly see the react part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#adding-reactjs-to-app" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Adding React.js to app
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will update the &lt;code&gt;default.html.ep&lt;/code&gt; to include the react.js&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;charset=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"utf-8"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;%=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

        %= content 'head'
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            %= content
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://unpkg.com/react@17/umd/react.production.min.js"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;crossorigin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;crossorigin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

        %= content 'end'
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are using the &lt;code&gt;production&lt;/code&gt; minified version. You can also use the &lt;code&gt;development&lt;/code&gt; version also for debugging purpose.&lt;br&gt;
I have added react.js on layout template as we will be using it all our web pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;multi_line_chart.html.ep&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;% layout 'default';
% title 'Charts';

% content_for 'head' =&amp;gt; begin
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;rel=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"stylesheet"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"text/css"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"css/charts.css"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
% end

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"root"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

% content_for 'end' =&amp;gt; begin
    %= javascript "https://cdn.amcharts.com/lib/4/core.js"
    %= javascript "https://cdn.amcharts.com/lib/4/charts.js"
    %= javascript "https://cdn.amcharts.com/lib/4/themes/animated.js"

    %= javascript "js/multi_line_chart.js"

    %= javascript begin 
        var domContainer = document.getElementById("root");
        createMultiLineChart(domContainer, &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;%==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;chart_data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;);
    % end
% end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are geeting the &lt;code&gt;$chart_data&lt;/code&gt; form &lt;code&gt;create_multi_line_chart&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;lib\MojoReactApp\Controller\Charts.pm&lt;/code&gt; when the template get rendered.&lt;br&gt;
Lets update the &lt;code&gt;public/js/multi_line_chart.js&lt;/code&gt; to make it a React Component.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;use strict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// React without JSX&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;MultiLineChart&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;state&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;chartId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;chartId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;chartData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createSeries&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;chart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;axis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Create series&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;series&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;chart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;series&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;am4charts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;LineSeries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//series.dataFields.categoryX = "Date";&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;series&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;strokeWidth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;chartId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createMultiLineChart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;domContainer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;chartData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ReactDOM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;MultiLineChart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;chartId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;chartdiv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;chartData&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;domContainer&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are calling the &lt;code&gt;createMultiLineChart&lt;/code&gt; function from our template with parameters. The main point to know here is the state and lifecycle functions - &lt;code&gt;componentDidMount&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;componentWillUnmount&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Since there are already plenty of documentation available, I encourage you to look into it. One of the place to learn the concept is react official docs- &lt;a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html"&gt;State and Lifecycle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look closely the rest of function definition is not much changes from the &lt;a href="https://dev.to/raigaurav/data-visualization-using-amcharts-with-perl-and-mojo-38ff"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; used javascript. We just wrapped it in react.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final directory structure is -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📦mojo_react_app&lt;br&gt;
 ┣ 📂etc&lt;br&gt;
 ┃ ┗ 📜input_data.json&lt;br&gt;
 ┣ 📂lib&lt;br&gt;

 ┗ 📜README.md&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Save it and try to hit '&lt;a href="http://localhost:3000"&gt;http://localhost:3000&lt;/a&gt;' again. From the user perspective side nothing has changed, you will see the same output as before.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before we will starting with baby step.&lt;br&gt;
The usage of the above mentioned way is very limited. You can use the react.js without jsx when your scope is small - where you have to make a website of few pages because here we are not using the full power of react.&lt;br&gt;
To use the react.js with full potential and unleash its power you have to use jsx. We will be looking in to it our next article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above example is available at &lt;a href="https://github.com/rai-gaurav/mojo_react_app/tree/main/without_jsx"&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re building a project that you’re passionate about, or have an idea or two that you haven’t been able to sit down and build yet, you should consider applying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This program gives you one week to work on your project alongside some of the most successful founders in their 20s (and older successful people as well). You can think of this like a virtual hacker house.  Instead of taking a one-week vacation from school or your job, you will get to work on your own ideas surrounded by mentors.  You will get $10,000 to spend however you’d like as early funding.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello guys, in this post I will talk about the simplest and easiest way to validate form fields according to my point of view, please enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, let's create the validators.js file:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;myValidators&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;


        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;isEmpty&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;trim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

      <title>A futuristic dark theme `Aurora Future`</title>
      <author>Benny Guo</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Apr 2021 16:32:34 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/auroral-ui/a-futuristic-dark-theme-aurora-future-310p</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/auroral-ui/a-futuristic-dark-theme-aurora-future-310p</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aurora-future"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Aurora Future
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This theme is inspired by &lt;strong&gt;Adam Argyle&lt;/strong&gt;'s &lt;a href="https://github.com/argyleink/Kung-Fury-Theme"&gt;Kung-Fury-Theme&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purple&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;pink&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;blue&lt;/strong&gt; are the main colors of this theme. These colors combine give us a futuristic feel. The color scheme is inspired by Adam Argyle's theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However I have change the colors, to follow the colors used in &lt;code&gt;Auroral-UI&lt;/code&gt;, basically the same colors used in my &lt;a href="https://github.com/auroral-ui/hexo-theme-aurora"&gt;Hexo Theme Aurora&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-make-this-theme"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why make this theme?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First is because I fall in love with Adam Argyle's sublime3 theme when I watched his Youtube videos. The syntax highlight he did is just pure awesomeness, but his VSCode's version of the theme is very outdated, also the color saturation is just a bit too high for my own liking, therefore I decided to make my own base on his ideas. Another thing is that I would like to have my own custom theme to go with my Auroral-UI project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have used many themes in VSCode, but most of them used way too many colors. After writing hours of codes, my eyes gets very tiring of looking at those colors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore the main goal of this theme is to use the main colors of Auroral-UI and draw back all the distractions from the colors. Which help us focus on what is important and keep the visual harmony in the theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#features"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Features
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I follow the same goals as Adam Argyle's sublime3 theme, because I couldn't agree more on his design concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Accentuates the signal&lt;/strong&gt; of your code, while pushing back the noise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colors, italics, and subdued colors are meaningful to help you understand the code via consistent coloring, there's rhyme and reason for the choices beyond visual harmony&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your code has no errors, then it looks pythonic (noise reduction)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dark mode that's been tested heavily for day and night use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leverages cursive if you're using &lt;a href=""&gt;Dank Mono&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=""&gt;Operator Mono&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#recommended-combination"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Recommended combination
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Font&lt;/strong&gt;: use &lt;strong&gt;Dank Mono&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Operator Mono&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Icon theme&lt;/strong&gt;: Material Theme Icon Dark&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#screenshots"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Screenshots
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#javascript"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  JavaScript
&lt;/h3&gt;

      <title>Javascript: what I didn't understand</title>
      <author>Mehdi Zed</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Apr 2021 15:55:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/jesuisundev/javascript-what-i-didn-t-understand-14hl</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/jesuisundev/javascript-what-i-didn-t-understand-14hl</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Javascript is one of the most accessible languages. But between those who use it and those who master it, there is a clear difference. Javascript is full of nuances, fuzzy behaviors and hidden concepts. It'll drive you crazy if you don't know them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-javascript-trap"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Javascript trap
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, I arrived in a new team. Behind me, a strong PHP specialization. This day was important. I gave up &lt;a href="https://www.jesuisundev.com/en/religion-among-developers/"&gt;my PHP religion&lt;/a&gt; to join a team of Javascript religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I am convinced of two things. &lt;strong&gt;Javascript is easy and I already mastered it perfectly.&lt;/strong&gt; No need to really understand how the bowels of the language work to use it. It's going to be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But soon I began to see some disturbing things on the horizon. I came across code, concepts and terms that were completely opaque. I didn't get worried right away. It was quite far from my area of intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I should have worried right away.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--O1WB-rwx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-mist-1.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--O1WB-rwx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-mist-1.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks later, my first big mission in the team fell on my desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The entire rewriting of a hinge service for the product.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without going into details, we can compare this service to a kind of CDN. The client sends a ZIP file, my service has to manage a lot of things. On-the-fly file extraction with recursion (zip in zip), upload, caching, static file service, versioning, metadata. All this while keeping 100% of calls under 200ms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing this kind of thing correctly requires an internal understanding of how Javascript works. I didn't know that yet. I was about to suffer in front of mistakes and incomprehensible behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Javascript trap had just closed on me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tUj-AXYw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/QgLhr9OmihnKos1algcDGiuTd30/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-%21%21-:strip_icc-%21%21-/2016/03/18/885/n/1922283/e0bbf8adf7aa1229_MCDMIST_EC044_H/i/Mist.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tUj-AXYw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/QgLhr9OmihnKos1algcDGiuTd30/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-%21%21-:strip_icc-%21%21-/2016/03/18/885/n/1922283/e0bbf8adf7aa1229_MCDMIST_EC044_H/i/Mist.JPG" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the surface, Javascript is very accessible and you quickly do wonders with it. &lt;strong&gt;A superficial knowledge of internal mechanics is often sufficient.&lt;/strong&gt; Hence the number of people who use it without really knowing what they are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when you end up tackling more complex things, you're quickly lost, and your impostor syndrome begins to stare you intensely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#unknown-variables"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Unknown variables
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I tell you about what drove me crazy when I started this service, let's go back a few years. Like many people, I learned Javascript on the job. I had to do it so I started doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As required by the time, I write jQuery. I thought i was a god at it. I managed to do everything that was asked of me. In spite of what I was thinking, from time to time I got some big slaps in the face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple things don't work. It bugs for no reason. And strangely enough, the fact that I'm banging my keyboard hard doesn't solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My problems came from the first thing I didn't understand with Javascript: the internal workings of variables and types.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand what i'm talking about, let's look at some code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What will this code display and why?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;originalEzio&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;ezio Auditore da Firenze&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;weapon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Hidden Blade&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;metadata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Original&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Assassin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;originalEzio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getHeroCopy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;originalHero&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;copyHero&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;originalHero&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;weapon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;originalHero&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;weapon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;metadata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;originalHero&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;metadata&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;copyHero&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;metadata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;version&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Copy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;copyHero&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;copyOfEzio&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getHeroCopy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;originalEzio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Original : &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;originalEzio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Copy : &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;copyOfEzio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know, it's look like a stupid Javascript trivia question. But please, play the game, take the time to predict what it will display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's check your prediction by pressing play on the Repl just below.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag__replit"&gt;
  &lt;iframe height="550px" src="https://repl.it/@jesuisundev/primitiveandcomplex?lite=true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you can't explain this result, you're missing something in the foundations of language. A short explanation in a few words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Variables are divided into two main categories: primitives and complexes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Primitives (string, number, boolean, …) point to unique values.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are immutable. Hence the fact that the string does not change (line 10). By the way, if you add "use strict" at the beginning of the file, it throws immediately. In strict world, Javascript does not allow this devilry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complexes (object, …) point to value references.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are mutable. Line 16, I refer to the metadata object of the original hero and assign it to the metadata object of the copy. By changing the copy, I therefore change the reference of the original.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started, I didn't have these notions. And believe me, it's no fun not having them. &lt;strong&gt;A lot of people don't have them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--J5FACA8i--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.scifinow.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/the-mist.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--J5FACA8i--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.scifinow.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/the-mist.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal today is not to give you a lesson. The goal is to point out the pitfalls I've encountered. To make sure that you avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3bytIXF"&gt;a recommendation&lt;/a&gt; for you at the end of the article to understand and overcome all these pitfalls.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before that, let's continue to point out the places where I wallowed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-the-fuck-is-this"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What the fuck is this
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the rewriting of the service, I was helped by many internal and external library. Some more recent than others. Some better done than others. They used all the object dimension of Javascript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Or more precisely, prototype oriented programming, an incomplete form of object programming.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even today, despite the syntactic sugar of the classes, it is still prototypes. Javascript is not really an object-language. See you on twitter for some fight those who disagree.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// what you use&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Assassin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getCreed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Nothing is true, everything is permitted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//---------------&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// what JS really does behind&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Assassin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Assassin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;prototype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getCreed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Nothing is true, everything is permitted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In short, I got to know the contexts in Javascript. With these schizophrenic perimeter rules. I immediately started using my head to smash my keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, a annoying trivia question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;***&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What will this code display and why?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;***&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;altair&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;templarsKilled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Tamir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Talal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Sibrand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;showTemplarsKilled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`List of templar killed (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;templarsKilled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;) by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;templarsKilled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;templarKilled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; killed &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;templarKilled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;altair&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;showTemplarsKilled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can check your prediction with the Repl just below.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag__replit"&gt;
  &lt;iframe height="550px" src="https://repl.it/@jesuisundev/context-this-scope?lite=true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Why doesn't the second log (line 8) work? Why does the first log (line 5) work? Why using an arrow function (line 7) solves the problem?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are not able to answer these questions, it is because the famous (this) Javascript context is blurred for you. &lt;strong&gt;And that's understandable.&lt;/strong&gt; In Javascript, the context doesn't behave at all like in other languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're dealing with a monster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--e8ndM2Zp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/mal0u5O.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--e8ndM2Zp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/mal0u5O.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory, "this" represents the context of the function. An object associated with the invocation of the function. Except that it is not so simple. In truth, it will be determined according to how it is called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's look at some examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Call in a function, the context will be the global object. If you don't know it, you tragically change the global object. This is evil.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;creed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Nothing is true, everything is permitted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;showCreed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;creed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;showCreed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Except in strict mode. In strict mode it is undefined. You don't know it, this time everything goes wrong.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;use strict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;creed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Nothing is true, everything is permitted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;showCreed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;showCreed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// undefined&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Call in method of a function, the context will be the object in question, as we want. This is why the "showTemplarsKilled" function above works. But not the next nested function. The next one has its own context.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;showTemplarsKilled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// this -&amp;gt; objet context&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`List of templar killed (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;templarsKilled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;) by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;templarsKilled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;templarKilled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// this -&amp;gt; function context&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; killed &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;templarKilled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I don't know if you've ever seen code create variables like "self" or "_this" that passed the current context? That's exactly why. A relatively disgusting hack to keep the current context.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;showTemplarsKilled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`List of templar killed (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;templarsKilled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;) by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;templarsKilled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;templarKilled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; killed &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;templarKilled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today, the most elegant way is to use an arrow function. In addition to making our code more readable and shorter, it passes the current context to the called function. Neat.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;showTemplarsKilled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`List of templar killed (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;templarsKilled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;) by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;templarsKilled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;templarKilled&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; killed &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;templarKilled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I'm telling you I don't want to lecture, but I'm throwing myself into explanations anyway. Please stop me when I start going off all over the place like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, while I was doing this famous service, I was far from suspecting all this. And all these rules of context depending on where and how you call out made me freak out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It made the speed and quality of what I was producing … let's say questionable. The first few weeks on it were laborious. And even if that wasn't true, I had the impression that my team was beginning to doubt what I could bring to the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TLVQOjG2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://pbs.twimg.com/media/COeVSEYVEAASqdh.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TLVQOjG2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://pbs.twimg.com/media/COeVSEYVEAASqdh.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a lot of (too much) time and pain, I gradually managed, module by module, to produce something. However, this was just the beginning of my discoveries. I was not at the end of my pains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#deployment"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Deployment
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll pass the various adventures on the road, let's go straight to the deployment. At that point I am convinced that my stuff is working. I have 3 million tests. It's been running on dev for a week. I would have gladly bet an arm and two legs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday morning, I finally deploy the service, it works perfectly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as the day went by, the more users were gradually using the new version, the more I saw the response time increase worryingly. In the middle of the afternoon, the first email from a customer arrives in my inbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is clearly related to my service.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even when i was looking precisely at the slow code, I didn't understand. The response times kept getting longer and longer. I was more and more in the fog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nzMdLCha--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/nv8ecrj.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nzMdLCha--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/nv8ecrj.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn't a big mistake It was a collection of subtle little errors that slowed down my application. Let's take a closer look at one of them. I promise, last interview question, then I'll leave you alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's wrong with the following code?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;_load&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;assetFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;assetRoute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cdn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getFileInfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;assetFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;assetInfo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setAssetInCache&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;assetFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;assetInfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getAssetFromCache&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;assetRoute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Can't get asset from cache.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem is line 5 with the use of JSON.stringify. &lt;strong&gt;This is a blocking operation.&lt;/strong&gt; In a non-blocking asynchronous world, you have to be very careful with this kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JSON.stringify blocks the thread it is in. Since Javascript is single thread, this is problematic. So yes, the promise gives a delay to the blocking. But when the stringify executes, nothing executes until it's finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thus blocking all the rest of the application.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, stringify is not a problem. What needs to be stringified is so small that the function is done almost instantaneously. Except that here, thousands of files -more or less large- are processed simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Millisecond by millisecond, the response time went up to 1 second per call!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more users used the application, the more it was an ordeal for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yK7Bmqt_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/AXEH1mb.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yK7Bmqt_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/AXEH1mb.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That's the day I really started to get interested in the event loop.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How it works, what is at stake, the different phases. From timers to close callback to I/O polling. It was going to be very useful on NodeJS. But also on javascript in a general way in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it is important to know that even if the global functioning of the event loop in the browser and in NodeJS is the same, &lt;strong&gt;there are differences when zooming&lt;/strong&gt;. I say this because you will always have a self-proclaimed "expert" to correct you -in an unbearable way- as if it was important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, with a little time and crying a little blood, I ended up correcting all the incriminated places. The response time went under 200 ms. And I thought I was done learning the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#breaking-point"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Breaking point
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks later, I attended a meeting with my colleagues. It was an important meeting where I was going to discuss technical issues. A new service was planned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This meeting was going to be the breaking point that would really push me to act.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hardly mentioned the meeting. Despite my learning about the service, it wasn't enough to keep up. Concepts and technical terms were flying around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the discussion was becoming more and more complicated. Participating in it without saying anything stupid, even more so. It was about closures, generators, the risk of memory leaks and using proxies for advanced monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this was clear in my head. It was time to act to get out of this fog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DeRyX463--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/3cWvKXh.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DeRyX463--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/3cWvKXh.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#raising-your-game"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Raising your game
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I returned to my post after the meeting, I took my courage in both hands. I asked one of my colleagues for clarification on the content of the meeting. The discussion quickly turned around a book he had read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My recommendation of the day : &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3slPftn"&gt;Secrets of the Javascript Ninja&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book is the starting point of all my confidence with Javascript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By explaining me deeply the internal workings, the behaviors on the surface have become clear. My code became fast and robust. The interview trap questions were easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It starts very softly with what happens in the browser with Javascript. Then, he quickly gets to the heart of the matter with the functions. Understanding -really- how they work changes everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then the incredible part about the closures and the functioning of the lexical fields which was a revelation for me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, generators, promises and prototypes. Finally, it ends with a deep dive into the holy event loop that I FINALLY understood. I came out of &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3slPftn"&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt; with a clear vision. Ready to fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hFuulQOO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/qInp5XY.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hFuulQOO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/qInp5XY.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let's be clear. I have always been very honest with my recommendations. &lt;strong&gt;This book is not an easy read.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not for you if you're just starting Javascript. There are complex moments where I had to think more, read, reread and look at the diagrams to really get it. &lt;strong&gt;But that's what this book is all about.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book is for those who have been using Javascript for some time and want to raise their game. It is for those who want to dominate this language. It is for those who want to create an expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it were that simple, everyone would be an expert. This book pushes you into the fog to get you out of it. There is no evolution without friction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#epilogue"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Epilogue
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many people, I fell into the Javascript trap thinking it was an "easy" language. All my mistakes and painful moments could have been avoided by taking seriously the language learning process beforehand. It's up to you to see if you want to take the risk.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>6 Different Ways I Make Money as a Software Developer  -  You Can Too</title>
      <author>Sunil Kumar</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Apr 2021 15:28:02 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/sunilc_/6-different-ways-i-make-money-as-a-software-developer-you-can-too-6nd</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/sunilc_/6-different-ways-i-make-money-as-a-software-developer-you-can-too-6nd</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to make money on the internet for years, but I didn't know how to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a Software Developer is like a super power. The skill provides abundant opportunities to make money on the internet. You can literally change your life with this one skill. Although most of us learn how to code &amp;amp; build software as part of academia and then work in big MNCs, we still don't know the endless possibilities the skill offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article I'll share the 6 different ways I make money from and how can do it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professional Developer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freelancing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Affiliate Marketing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blogging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Info Products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bootstrapping a SaaS Product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-professional-developer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Professional Developer
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the obvious choice everyone knows about. Software Developer is a lucrative job and you can make a lot of money if you stick with this for a long time. Software industry is surging and right now there's a huge demand for good software developers. So if you're a good developer, you can definitely be employed by one of the top paying companies like Google, Facebook, Atlassian etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This path is becoming less popular nowadays with the boom of creator economy. More people want to step away from the 9-5 rate race &amp;amp; want to have the freedom and start their own businesses even if they make less money initially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you're okay with working for someone else throughout your career and lead a comfortable life, then this is definitely an option you should consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm currently working as a Team Lead myself in Startup in India and getting paid good salary. But I do not want to continue working for someone else forever. I want to build a business of my own and retire early. To achieve this in the long term I'm working on the below ideas to make money on the side. Let's discuss about each of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-freelancing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Freelancing
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting started with freelancing is not easy. Everyone knows that. You know that some people are making hell lot of money through freelancing, charging thousand dollars to multiple clients building websites every month. But most people don't know how to get started with freelancing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many platforms where you can start your freelancing journey:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Toptal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freelancing .com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upwork&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Codementor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hubstaff Talent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fiverr etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start with small tasks. For example: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write a Python script to scrape top 10 results from google dot com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find such tasks on all the above platforms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that it's not easy to find your first task. I had given up on freelancing numerous times in the past after applying for countless jobs without getting any conversion. Finally in September 2019 Codementor helped me earn my first dollars through freelancing on the internet. If you want to get started with Codementor, &lt;a href="https://sunilkumarc.in/kick-start-your-freelancing-career-with-these-tips"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;'s an article for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start slow. Once you gain the confidence to talk to people, convince them to give you tasks, try to scale your freelancing business. Try to find bigger projects which can span multiple months. I know this is not easy. But if you can do this, it can give you the flexibility &amp;amp; freedom you always wanted from your 9-5 job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been making good money on the side from freelancing. I'm mainly active on Codementor &amp;amp; trying to get into Toptal now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-affiliate-marketing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Affiliate Marketing
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Affiliate Marketing is one of the easiest ways to make money on the internet. But without an audience or a social media following it can be difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here you basically earn a commission by selling someone else's product to people through your unique link. The thing I love about affiliate marketing is that you don't need to have a product of your own. You can sell the already proven and loved products &amp;amp; make a commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies like Gumroad are really revolutionising the creator economy with more and more people creating info products every single day. You can find these creators on social media channels like Twitter, Instagram etc. You can DM them and ask them if they're open to add you as an affiliate for their products. Once they add you, you get a unique link which you can then share with your audience and make sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But It's not as simple as it sounds. There are challenges with this business, just like with any other. To sell products to more people you need to have a good online presence, basically a list of people who follow you, trust you and want to buy products from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building an online presence is a slow process and takes time. You need to consistently provide value for free for a long period of time to build a significant follower base. I have been growing my Twitter presence from the past 10 months. I had around 150 followers when I started. At the time of writing this articles I have 17.1k followers on my Twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sunilc_"&gt;account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have made around 2.6k USD on &lt;a href="https://gumroad.com/sunilkumarc"&gt;Gumroad&lt;/a&gt; from the past 8 months, mainly promoting products on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--X1Q83wwP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1618579957482/eB3jV8Wzv.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--X1Q83wwP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1618579957482/eB3jV8Wzv.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-04-16 at 7.01.49 PM.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I'm trying to scale this income by applying new strategies. Let's see where it takes me in the next couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-blogging"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Blogging
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blogging is another great way to make money on the internet. Many people think that blogs are dead and nobody reads articles anymore in a world where YouTube is famous. But that's not the case at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People do read articles and you can still try blogging if you're not comfortable with talking in front of a camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to make money through blogging. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Medium partner program&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freelance writer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Affiliate marketing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paid articles etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medium partner program is one of the popular platforms for beginners to start making money. Of course you will earn less in the beginning. But if you are consistent you can make a lot of money in the long run. Some of the top writers on Medium make more than 25k USD per month on Medium partner program. In fact the money you make per view is more than you make on YouTube!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see how Shelby was able to make money from Medium Partner Program without any prior experience in these videos:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZqG2ESJUaw"&gt;Making Money Online Writing for Medium... Is It Worth Your Time?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGQn7xg2kSs"&gt;I made $6,000 from my Medium.com article... an update&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've started writing articles on &lt;a href="https://sunilc.medium.com"&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt; and have made very little money so far. But this is still the beginning &amp;amp; I'm happy with the way things are going. Here are my earning for the month of April 2021 so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9gDCE-6p--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1618582157175/HRR0R7hcD.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9gDCE-6p--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1618582157175/HRR0R7hcD.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-04-16 at 7.39.06 PM.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-info-products"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Info Products
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier the creator economy is booming and more people are creating info products and making a living out it, every single day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically you create info products like ebooks which can be as small as 10 pages to a couple of hundred pages or a video course etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pick any niche you know something about and create an info product in that. You don't need to be an expert in the area to do this. You can research on the things you're not clear about. Basically people are willing to pay for anything which they can learn from or solves their problems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example so many people want to make money through freelancing but most of them struggle to find their first task. Having freelancing experience on my side, I can create a small ebook which covers how to get that first task and start making money. This information can be valuable to many people and they will pay for such a product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good thing about info products is that it's a one time effort to create the product and you can make money for life with minimal effort for occasional marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dvassallo"&gt;Daniel Vassallo&lt;/a&gt; has made around 350k USD from 2 of his products in around 2 years after quitting his job at Amazon. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dvassallo/status/1379690025177124867"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fg6CWsaK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1618595858240/dQos8sieP.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many successful people on Twitter who are killing it with their info products on Twitter. After getting inspired by Daniel's journey even I started building an audience and released my &lt;a href="https://gum.co/joCkt"&gt;ebook&lt;/a&gt; for free in December 2020. These are the stats at the time of writing this article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Downloads: 1639 copies &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Revenue: 150.99 USD &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eNPRDrnj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1618646566907/zQQjhpOgK.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eNPRDrnj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1618646566907/zQQjhpOgK.jpeg" alt="developer-wisdom-stats.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the ebook is available for free, so many people still decided to pay for it because they want to support my work and appreciate all the valuable free content I post on Twitter every single day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-bootstrapping-a-saas-product"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. Bootstrapping a SaaS Product
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bootstrapping SaaS products is another popular way to make money on the internet. Basically the idea here is to build a small product which solves a niche problem and sell it to users. This doesn't follow the typical startup path where the plan is to raise funds, build a team and scale it to a billion dollar company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here you mainly focus on keeping the team small. Typically between 1-5 people taking care of the complete product. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main idea behind bootstrapping is to get the freedom from working for someone else and work on something you love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bootstrapping a business is typically not easy (at least for me it wasn't!). You need to find a niche problem, validate the idea, see if people are willing to pay for such a product, build an MVP and finally market it and make money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people make the mistake of starting to build the product without validating the idea first. I made this mistake and built a product which I thought was cool and later realised that there was no demand for it. Do not make this mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to go this way, you should follow these people and see how they are building indie businesses online:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio"&gt;Pieter Levels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/arvidkahl"&gt;Arvid Kahl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arvid has a lot of resources on building bootstrapped businesses on his &lt;a href="https://thebootstrappedfounder.com"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also so inspired by Peiter's talk &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6reLWfFNer0"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; that it made me build my first bootstrapped product &lt;a href="https://landr.page"&gt;Landr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#resources"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Resources:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's is a list of all the &lt;a href="https://sunilkumarc.in/courses"&gt;courses&lt;/a&gt; I bought in 2020 which have helped me make money on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internet is a great place to build businesses with Software Developer skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build an online presence first. Having an online presence will help you see significant results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't focus on too many ideas at once. Stick to a couple and scale them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will make peanuts in the beginning. Stick with it for a long time to make more money. Compounding is the best thing there is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know that it's not easy to build an online business. Everyone struggles. Only when you are persistent, you will be successful at it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>(Java)Money and Kotlin</title>
      <author>Hidde Wieringa</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Apr 2021 14:55:57 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/hiddewie/java-money-and-kotlin-57ac</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/hiddewie/java-money-and-kotlin-57ac</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://javamoney.github.io/"&gt;JavaMoney API&lt;/a&gt; is part of &lt;a href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=354"&gt;JSR 354&lt;/a&gt; and will (hopefully) be part of the Java language in the future. The reference implementation &lt;a href="https://github.com/JavaMoney/jsr354-ri"&gt;Moneta&lt;/a&gt; provides good examples of implementations using the JavaMoney API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JavaMoney API allows working with &lt;em&gt;currencies&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;monetary values&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;conversion&lt;/em&gt; between monetary values of different currencies through &lt;em&gt;exchange rates&lt;/em&gt;. View the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heH08CROmb0"&gt;Devoxx video&lt;/a&gt; which explains the API in depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kotlin is interoperable with compiled Java libraries. So the JavaMoney/Moneta library can be used from Kotlin code, and makes working with money in business logic easy. After all, money seems trivial but details like rounding, conversion and catalogues of locales and currencies are hard to implement correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JavaMoney API is very flexible and extendable. The classes and interfaces provide a Builder pattern to contruct instances with fluent code. For example&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Construct a monetary value of €200 using the FastMoney implementation&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Monetary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;getAmountFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;FastMoney&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;setCurrencyUnit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"EUR"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;setNumber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;setContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;MonetaryContextBuilder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;MathContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;DECIMAL128&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The builder pattern does not look like ideomatic Kotlin. In Kotlin, &lt;a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/type-safe-builders.html"&gt;builder DSLs&lt;/a&gt; are used instead to fluently construct complex objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is exactly what I implemented in &lt;a href="https://github.com/hiddewie/money-kotlin"&gt;Money-Kotlin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#moneykotlin"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Money-Kotlin
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://github.com/hiddewie/money-kotlin"&gt;Money-Kotlin&lt;/a&gt; library extends the JavaMoney API with Kotlin extension functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The example above could be rewritten in Kotlin as&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight kotlin"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Construct a monetary value of €200 using the FastMoney implementation&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ofCurrency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;FastMoney&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"EUR"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;monetaryContext&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;MathContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;DECIMAL128&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More details are given below. Some of the (Java) examples are taken from the &lt;a href="https://github.com/JavaMoney/jsr354-ri/blob/master/moneta-core/src/main/asciidoc/userguide.adoc"&gt;Moneta User Guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#monetary-amounts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Monetary amounts
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first example displayed above shows how to construct monetary values. Often we do not need a monetary context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Monetary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;getAmountFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;FastMoney&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;setCurrencyUnit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"EUR"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;setNumber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;200.01&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kotlin:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight kotlin"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;val&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="py"&gt;money&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;200.01&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ofCurrency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;FastMoney&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"EUR"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can manipulate money amounts as well, just like regular numbers. This has been implemented using Kotlin operator overloading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;MonetaryAmount&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;money&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;...;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// add&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;money&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;money&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;money&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;plus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// subtract &amp;amp; negate&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;money&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;subtract&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;money&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;money&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;negate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// multiply&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;money&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;multiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// divide &amp;amp; remainder&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;money&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;divide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;money&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;remainder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kotlin:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight kotlin"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// add&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;money&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;money&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;money&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// subtract &amp;amp; negate&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;money&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;money&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;money&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// multiply&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;money&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;money&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// divide &amp;amp; remainder&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;money&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;money&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#currencies"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Currencies
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can access a default or self-implemented currency (like Bitcoin) from the &lt;code&gt;Monetary&lt;/code&gt; singleton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;CurrencyUnit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;currencyEUR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Monetary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;getCurrency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"EUR"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kotlin:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight kotlin"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"EUR"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;asCurrency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#locales"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Locales
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JavaMoney API associates a locale with a currency. For example, in The Netherlands the official currency is the Euro. Some countries have multiple currencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Locale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"NL"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Monetary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;getCurrency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Locale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"NL"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Monetary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;getCurrencies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Locale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"NL"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kotlin:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight kotlin"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"NL"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;asCountryLocale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;"NL"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;asCountryLocale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;getCurrency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;"NL"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;asCountryLocale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;getCurrencies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#rounding"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Rounding
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A monetary value can be rounded in a specific way. Construct a rounding query to get a &lt;code&gt;MonetaryRounding&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Monetary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;getRounding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nc"&gt;RoundingQueryBuilder&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;setScale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;RoundingMode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;HALF_UP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kotlin:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight kotlin"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Monetary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;getRounding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;roundingQuery&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;setScale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;RoundingMode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;HALF_UP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#currency-conversion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Currency conversion
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;MonetaryAmount&lt;/code&gt; can be converted from one currency to another currency through a &lt;code&gt;CurrencyConversion&lt;/code&gt;. A &lt;code&gt;CurrencyConversion&lt;/code&gt; depends on a conversion provider. There are some default providers implemented out of the box, like the &lt;em&gt;European Central Bank&lt;/em&gt; (ECB) and &lt;em&gt;International Monetary Fund&lt;/em&gt; (IMF). These providers provide currency exchange rates, in particular historic rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The order of the default providers are configurable, and you can implement your own conversion provider as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;ExchangeRateProvider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rateProvider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;MonetaryConversions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;getExchangeRateProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"ECB"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"IMF"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;MonetaryAmount&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;amountInEUR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;...;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;MonetaryAmount&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;amountInCHF&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;amountInEUR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;rateProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;getExchangeRate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"EUR"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"CHF"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Using the default rate providers&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;MonetaryAmount&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;amountInCHF&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;amountInEUR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;MonetaryConversions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;getExchangeRateProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;getExchangeRate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"EUR"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"CHF"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kotlin:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight kotlin"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;val&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="py"&gt;rateProvider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;MonetaryConversions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;getExchangeRateProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"ECB"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"IMF"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;val&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="py"&gt;amountInEUR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;val&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="py"&gt;amountInCHF&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;amountInEUR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;convertTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"CHF"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rateProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Using the default rate providers&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;val&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="py"&gt;amountInCHF&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;amountInEUR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;convertTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"CHF"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#formatting"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Formatting
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monetary amounts are formatted in the context of a locale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;MonetaryAmountFormat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;MonetaryFormats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;getAmountFormat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Locale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;GERMANY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;MonetaryAmount&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;amount&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;...;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;amount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kotlin:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight kotlin"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;val&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="py"&gt;amount&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;val&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="py"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Locale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;GERMANY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;monetaryAmountFormat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;amount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#getting-started"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Getting started
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use the Money-Kotlin library today! It has been published on &lt;a href="https://search.maven.org/artifact/nl.hiddewieringa/money-kotlin/"&gt;Maven Central&lt;/a&gt;, and can be added as a dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many more examples in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/hiddewie/money-kotlin/#readme"&gt;project readme&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gradle:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight kotlin"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;implementation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"nl.hiddewieringa:money-kotlin:$moneyKotlinVersion"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maven:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight xml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;nl.hiddewieringa&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;money-kotlin&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;${moneyKotlin.version}&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
