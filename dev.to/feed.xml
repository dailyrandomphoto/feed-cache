      <description>&lt;p&gt;Processing real-time streaming data requires throughput scalability, reliability, high availability, and low latency to support a variety of applications and workloads. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some examples include: streaming ETL, real-time analytics, fraud detection, API microservices integration, fraud detection activity tracking, real-time inventory and recommendations, and click-stream, log file, and IoT device analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Streaming data architectures are built on five core constructs: data sources, stream ingestion, stream storage, stream processing, and destinations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these components can be created and launched using AWS Managed Services and deployed and managed as a purpose-built solution on Amazon EC2, Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--izkieqzm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/w3sb7htbr67ij1quztdf.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--izkieqzm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/w3sb7htbr67ij1quztdf.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Architecture Options for Building an Analytics Application on AWS&lt;/strong&gt; is a Series containing different articles that cover the key scenarios that are common in many analytics applications and how they influence the design and architecture of your analytics environment in AWS. These series present the assumptions made for each of these scenarios, the common drivers for the design, and a reference architecture for how these scenarios should be implemented. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stream processing, data processing on its head, is all about processing a flow of events. A typical stream application consists of a number of producers that generate new events and a set of consumers that process these events. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Events in the system can be any number of things, such as financial transactions, user activity on a website, or application metrics. Consumers can aggregate incoming data, send automatic alerts in real-time, or produce new streams of data that can be processed by other consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of each of these components include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Data sources&lt;/strong&gt;: Application and click stream logs, mobile apps, existing transactional relational and NoSQL databases, IoT sensors, and metering devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Stream ingestion and producers&lt;/strong&gt;: Both open source and proprietary toolkits, libraries, and SDKs for Kinesis Data Streams and Apache Kafka to create custom stream producers, AWS service integrations such as AWS IoT Core, CloudWatch Logs and Events, Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, AWS Data Migration Service (DMS), and third-party integrations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Stream storage&lt;/strong&gt;: Kinesis Data Streams, Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK), and Apache Kafka.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Stream processing and consumers&lt;/strong&gt;: Amazon EMR (Spark Structured Streaming, Apache Flink), AWS Glue ETL Streaming, Kinesis Data Analytics for Apache Flink, third-party integrations, and build-your-own custom applications using AWS and open source community SDKs and libraries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Downstream destinations&lt;/strong&gt;: Databases, data warehouses, purpose-built systems such as OpenSearch services, data lakes, and various third-party integrations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With these five components in mind, next let’s consider the characteristics as you design your stream processing pipeline for real-time ingestion and nearly continuous stream processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#characteristics"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Characteristics
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scalable throughput&lt;/strong&gt;: For real-time analytics, you should plan a resilient stream storage infrastructure that can adapt to changes in the rate of data flowing through the stream. Scaling is typically performed by an administrative application that monitors shard and partition data-handling metrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic stream processor consumption and collaboration&lt;/strong&gt;: Stream processors and consumers should automatically discover newly added Kinesis shards or Kafka partitions, and distribute them equitably across all available resources to process independently or collaboratively as a consumption group (Kinesis Application Name, Kafka Consumer Group).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Durable&lt;/strong&gt;: Real-time streaming systems should provide high availability and data durability. For example, Amazon Kinesis Data Streams and Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka replicate data across Availability Zones providing the high durability that streaming applications need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Replay-ability&lt;/strong&gt;: Stream storage systems should provide the ordering of records within shards and partitions, as well as the ability to independently read or replay records in the same order to stream processors and consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fault-tolerance, checkpoint, and replay&lt;/strong&gt;: Checkpointing refers to recording the farthest point in the stream that data records have been consumed and processed. If the consuming application crashes, it can resume reading the stream from that point instead of having to start at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loosely coupled integration&lt;/strong&gt;: Loosely coupled integration: A key benefit of streaming applications is the construct of loose coupling. The value of loose coupling is the ability of stream ingestion, stream producers, stream processors, and stream consumers to act and behave independently of one another. Examples include the ability to scale consumers outside of the producer configuration and adding additional stream processors and consumers to receive from the same stream or topic as existing stream processors and consumers, but perform different actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allow multiple processing applications in parallel&lt;/strong&gt;: The ability for multiple applications to consume the same stream concurrently is an essential characteristic of a stream processing system. For example, you might have one application that updates a real-time dashboard and another that archives data to Amazon Redshift. You want both applications to consume data from the same stream concurrently and independently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Messaging semantics&lt;/strong&gt;: In a distributed messaging system, components might fail independently. Different messaging systems implement different semantic guarantees between a producer and a consumer in the case of such a failure. The most common message delivery guarantees implemented are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;At most once&lt;/strong&gt;: Messages that could not be delivered, or are lost, are never redelivered&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;At least once&lt;/strong&gt;: Message might be delivered more than once to the consumer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Exactly once&lt;/strong&gt;: Message is delivered exactly once&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depending on your application needs, you need to choose a message delivery system that supports one or more of these required semantics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt;: Streaming ingest and processing systems need to be secure by default. You need to grant access by using the principal of least privilege to the streaming APIs and infrastructure, and encrypt data at rest and in transit. Both Kinesis Data Streams and Amazon MSK can be configured to use AWS IAM policies to grant least privilege access. For stream storage in particular, allow encryption in transit for producers and consumers, and encryption at rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#reference-architecture"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Reference architecture
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gxVP17Hz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/adnbq3hp2lf8gt6nj3mo.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gxVP17Hz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/adnbq3hp2lf8gt6nj3mo.png" alt="Image description" width="800" height="444"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Streaming data analytics reference architecture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The preceding streaming reference architecture diagram is segmented into the previously described components of streaming scenarios:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data sources&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stream ingestion and producers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stream storage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stream processing and consumers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downstream destinations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All, or portions, of this reference architecture can be used for workloads such as application modernization with microservices, streaming ETL, ingest, real-time inventory, recommendations, or fraud detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this section, we will identify each layer of components shown in the preceding diagram with specific examples. The examples are not intended to be an exhaustive list, but rather an attempt to describe some of the more popular options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subsequent Configuration notes section provides recommendations and considerations when implementing streaming data scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note : There are two bidirectional event flow lanes noted with an asterisk (*) in the diagram. We will review the five core components of streaming architecture first, and then discuss these specialized flows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data sources&lt;/strong&gt; : The number of potential data sources is in the millions. Examples include application logs, mobile apps and applications with REST APIs, IoT sensors, existing application databases (RDBMS, NoSQL) and metering records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stream ingestion and producers&lt;/strong&gt; : Multiple data sources generate data continually that might amount to terabytes of data per day. Toolkits, libraries, and SDKs can be used to develop custom stream producers to streaming storage. In contrast to custom developed producers, examples of pre-built producers include Kinesis Agent, Change Data Capture (CDC) solutions, and Kafka Connect Source connectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Streaming storage&lt;/strong&gt; : Kinesis Data Streams, Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka, and self-managed Apache Kafka are all examples of stream storage options for ingesting, processing, and storing large streams of data records and events. Streaming storage implementations are modeled on the idea of a distributed, immutable commit log. Events are stored for a configurable duration (hours to days to months, or even permanently in some cases). While stored, events are available to any client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stream processing and consumers&lt;/strong&gt; : Real-time data streams can be processed sequentially and incrementally on a record-by-record basis over sliding time windows using a variety of services. Or, put another way, this can be where particular domain-specific logic resides and is computed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With Kinesis Data Analytics for Apache Flink or Kinesis Data Analytics Studio, you can process and analyze streaming data using standard SQL in a serverless way. The service allows you to quickly author and run SQL queries against streaming sources to perform time series analytics, feed real-time dashboards, and create real-time metrics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you work in an Amazon EMR environment, you can process streaming data using multiple options— Apache Flink or Spark Structured Streaming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, there are options for AWS Lambda, third-party integrations, and build-your-own custom applications using AWS SDKs, libraries, and open-source libraries and connectors for consuming from Kinesis Data Streams, Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka, and Apache Kafka.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Downstream destinations&lt;/strong&gt; : Data can be persisted to durable storage to serve a variety of use cases including ad hoc analytics and search, machine learning, alerts, data science experiments, and additional custom actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A special note on the data flow lanes noted with asterisk (*). There are two examples which both involve bidirectional flow of data to and from layer #3 streaming storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first example is the bidirectional flow of in-stream ETL between stream processor (#4) which uses one or more raw event sources from stream storage (#3) and performs, filtering, aggregations, joins, etc. and writes results back to streaming storage to a refined (that is, curated, hydrated) result stream or topic (#3) where it can be used by a different stream processor or downstream consumer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second bidirectional flow example is the ubiquitous application modernization microservice design (#2) which often use a streaming storage layer (#3) for decoupled microservice interaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The key takeaway here is for us to not presume that the streaming event flows exclusively from left-to-right over time in the reference architecture diagram. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#configuration-notes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Configuration notes
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As explored so far, we know streaming data architects have options for implementing particular components in their stack, for example, different options for streaming storage, streaming ingest, and streaming producers. While it’s impractical to provide in-depth recommendations for each layer’s options in this document, there are some high-level concepts to consider as guide posts, which we will present next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more in-depth analysis of a particular layer in your design, consider exploring the provided links within the following guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#streaming-application-guidelines"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Streaming application guidelines
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Determine business requirements first&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s always a best practice and practical to focus on your workload’s particular needs first, rather than starting with a feature-by-feature comparison between the technical options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, we often see organizations prioritizing Technical Feature A vs. Technical Feature B before determining their workload’s requirements. This is the wrong order. Determine your workload’s requirements first because AWS has a wide variety of purpose-built options at each streaming architecture layer to best match your requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical comparisons second.&lt;/strong&gt; After business requirements have been clearly established, the next step is to match your business requirements with the technical options that offer the best chance for success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, if your team has few technical operators, serverless might be a good option. Other technical questions about your workload might be whether you require a large number of independent stream processors and consuming applications, that is, one vs. many stream processors and consumers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What kind of manual or automatic scaling options are available to match business requirement throughput, latency, SLA, RPO, and RTO objectives? Is there a desire to use open source-based solutions? What are the security options and how well do they integrate into existing security postures? Is one path easier or more straightforward to migrate to versus another, for example, self-managed Apache Kafka to Amazon MSK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more about your options for various layers in the reference architecture stack, refer to the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Streaming ingest and producers&lt;/strong&gt; — Can be workload-dependent and use AWS service integrations, such as AWS IoT Core, CloudWatch Logs and Events, AWS Data Migration Service (AWS DMS), and third-party integrations (Refer to: Writing Data to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams in Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide ).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Streaming storage&lt;/strong&gt; — Kinesis Data Streams, Kinesis Data Firehose, Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK), and Apache Kafka (Refer to: Best Practices in Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka Developer Guide ).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Stream processing and consumers&lt;/strong&gt; — Kinesis Data Analytics for Apache Flink, Kinesis Data Firehose, AWS Lambda, open source and proprietary SDKs (Refer to: Advanced Topics for Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Consumers in Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide and Best Practices for Kinesis Data Analytics for Apache Flink in Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics Developer Guide ).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember separation of concerns.&lt;/strong&gt; Separation of concerns is the application design principle that promotes segmenting an application into distinct, particular area of concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, your application might require that stream processors and consumers are performing an aggregation computation in addition to recording the computation results to a downstream destination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it can be tempting to clump both of these concerns into one stream processors or consumers, it is recommended to consider separation instead. It’s often better in the segment isolate into multiple stream processors or consumers for operation monitoring, performance tuning isolation, and reducing the downtime blast radius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#development"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Development
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Existing or desired skills match.&lt;/strong&gt; Realizing value from streaming architectures can be difficult and often a new endeavor for various roles within organizations. Increase your chances of success by aligning your team’s existing skillsets, or desired skillsets, wherever possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, is your team familiar with Java or do they prefer a different language, such as Python or Go? Does your team prefer a graphical user interface for writing and deploying code? Work backwards from your existing skill resources and preferences to appropriate options for each component.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build vs. buy (Write your own or use off-the-shelf).&lt;/strong&gt; Consider whether an integration between components already exists or if you need to write your own. Or perhaps both options are available. Many teams new to streaming incorrectly assume that everything needs to be written from scratch. Instead, consider services such as Kafka Connect Connectors for inbound and outbound traffic, AWS Lambda, and Kinesis Data Firehose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#performance"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Performance
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aggregate records before sending to stream storage for increased throughput.&lt;/strong&gt; When using Kinesis, Amazon MSK, or Kafka, ensure that the messages are accumulated on the producer side before sending to stream dtorage. This is also referred to as batching records to increase throughput, but at the cost of increased latency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When working with Kinesis Data Streams, use Kinesis Client Library (KCL) to de-aggregate records.&lt;/strong&gt; KCL takes care of many of the complex tasks associated with distributed computing, such as load balancing across multiple instances, responding to instance failures, checkpointing processed records, and reacting to re-sharding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initial planning and adjustment of shards and partitions.&lt;/strong&gt; The most common mechanism to scale stream storage for stream processors and consumers is through the number of configured shards (Kinesis Data Streams) or partitions (Apache Kafka, Amazon MSK) for a particular stream. This is a common element across Kinesis Data Streams, Amazon MSK, and Apache Kafka, but options for scaling out (and in) the number of shards or partitions vary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka Developer Guide: Using LinkedIn's Cruise Control for Apache Kafka with Amazon MSK (for partition rebalancing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Spot Instances and automatic scaling to process streaming data cost effectively.&lt;/strong&gt; You can also process the data using AWS Lambda with Kinesis, Amazon MSK, or both, and Kinesis record aggregation and deaggregation modules for AWS Lambda . Various AWS services offer automatic scaling options to keep costs lower than provisioning for peak volumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#operations"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Operations
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor Kinesis Data Streams and Amazon MSK metrics using Amazon CloudWatch.&lt;/strong&gt; You can get basic stream and topic level metrics in addition to shard and partition level metrics. Amazon MSK also provides an Open Monitoring with Prometheus option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan for the unexpected / No single point of failure.&lt;/strong&gt; Some components in your streaming architecture will offer different options for durability in case of a failure. Kinesis Data Streams replicates to three different Availability Zones. With Apache Kafka and Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK), for example, producers can be configured to require acknowledgement for partition leader as well as a configurable amount in-sync replica followers before considering the write successful. In this example, you are able to plan for possible disruptions in your AWS environment, for example, if an Availability Zone goes offline, without possible downtime of your producing and consuming layers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;**Encryption in transit, encryption at rest. Streaming data actively moves from one layer to another, such as from a streaming data producer to stream storage over the internet or through a private network. Protecting data in transit, enterprises can and often choose to use encrypted connections (HTTPS, SSL, TLS) to protect the contents of data in transit. Many AWS streaming services offer protection of data at rest through encryption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  Design Pattern
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello👋 Its Rohan Kadam😊&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you are a newbie to coding👩‍💻 or programming, maybe experienced👴 or maybe a FrontEnd Developer or BackEnd Developer you all have may have come across the word Design Pattern as a principle or as a concept. The design pattern is a way or approach to writing code or developing an application. In this article, we try to answer certain questions What is Design Pattern? Why implement a design pattern? How to implement a Design pattern (&lt;strong&gt;Factory&lt;/strong&gt;)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HL1Pvbgl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1%2AcEm5ML8JhAEbawySBVGh_A.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HL1Pvbgl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1%2AcEm5ML8JhAEbawySBVGh_A.png" alt="How to Implement Factory Design Pattern?" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-design-pattern"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🏭What is Design Pattern?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design patterns&lt;/strong&gt; are the solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-fabricated blueprints that we can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are not pieces of code or libraries that can be imported and used in the development of software or solving a particular problem. We can follow the pattern details and implement a solution that suits the realities of your own program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We often confused ourself between design pattern and algorithms. While an algorithm always defines a clear set of actions that can achieve some goal, a pattern is a more upper-level description of a solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An analogy to an algorithm is a cooking dish: both have clear steps to achieve a goal. They’re not libraries or modules; they’re guidelines you integrate into the core of your designs, giving you a leg up in creating flexible and maintainable object-oriented systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-implement-a-design-pattern"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🏭Why implement a Design Pattern?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have encountered design patterns only in a nutshell, they’re general object-oriented solutions that you can use in your own designs. Crafted by experienced 👴object-oriented practitioners, design patterns can make your designs more flexible, more resilient to change, and easier to maintain. So, if design patterns still aren’t part of your development toolbelt, here are five reasons you should add them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 → Make our life easier by not reinventing the wheel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 → Improve our object-oriented Skills&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 → Recognize Patterns in libraries and languages&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 → Use the power of a shared vocabulary&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5 → Find Truth and beauty&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-implement-a-factory-design-pattern"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🏭How to implement a Factory Design Pattern?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before jumping directly into the implementation of the design pattern we need to answer certain questions such as What is a Factory design pattern? Why incorporate the design pattern? and finally How to implement a Factory Design Pattern?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 →What is Factory Design Pattern?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The factory design pattern is part of the Creational Design Pattern Family, it let us create an interface over subclass and let subclass do business logic work. A real-life example will be, &lt;strong&gt;Imagine you have run a big delivery business🛒, you got to deliver the package to a consumer now the question arises what should use you used delivery the particular car🚗 , truck 🚚or bicycle🛵&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;So to solution could be we give input as size and weight of a package based on that we decide which would be the best possible mode of transportation&lt;/strong&gt;. That's how the Factory pattern works in real life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Factory pattern is a design pattern that *&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;defines an interface or abstract class for creating an object but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate&lt;/em&gt;*&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 → Why implement Factory Design Pattern?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Factory allows us to follow the Design Principle (&lt;strong&gt;SOLID&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It fosters &lt;strong&gt;loose-coupling&lt;/strong&gt; by eliminating the need to bind application-specific classes into the code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It allows us to introduce new code without affecting the existing code structure like &lt;strong&gt;Plug and Play Model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 → How to Implement Factory Design Pattern?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In section, we try to implement Factory Design Pattern using Java. For example, we use the delivery manager example for selecting the mode of transportation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JBzl7u0H--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1%2AN7qnpUqGydS6BC1x19XGJg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JBzl7u0H--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1%2AN7qnpUqGydS6BC1x19XGJg.png" alt="Delivery Manager Examples" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1 → What input should the delivery manager give?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a Delivery Manager, he/she should give info about the package like &lt;strong&gt;size&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;weight&lt;/strong&gt;, in our example, we are using &lt;strong&gt;PackageInfo&lt;/strong&gt; to the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GZE4hI8T--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2408/1%2Al3vjAzE3O7QUEvP3EzP97g.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GZE4hI8T--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2408/1%2Al3vjAzE3O7QUEvP3EzP97g.png" alt="image1" width="880" height="1088"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2 → What will be various modes for making a delivery?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The various modes of delivering packages are car🚗, bicycle🏍 and truck🚚. We have created three-class defining the modes for delivery. According to the definition of Factory Pattern, we need to &lt;strong&gt;define an interface or abstract class in **our case we have created an **interface **named **PackageDelivery.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gIAAkiK8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2412/1%2AXBTTzPLh-HaOBe4cW9d9xQ.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gIAAkiK8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2412/1%2AXBTTzPLh-HaOBe4cW9d9xQ.png" alt="Package Delivery interface" width="880" height="560"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have created subclasses that are implemented by the PackageDelivery interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 →Delivery by bicycle🏍&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UykLO6wb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3364/1%2AOnHfj0euWnT44Ossx9NJbA.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UykLO6wb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3364/1%2AOnHfj0euWnT44Ossx9NJbA.png" alt="Delivery By Bicycle" width="880" height="477"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 →Delivery by Car&lt;/strong&gt;🚗&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MedJsRQw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3048/1%2A_LSj9cVD3AcGe85FCnMjZA.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MedJsRQw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3048/1%2A_LSj9cVD3AcGe85FCnMjZA.png" alt="Delivery By Car" width="880" height="527"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 →Delivery by Truck&lt;/strong&gt;🚚&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wK85cXm2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3220/1%2ASkHlDVmDKsvNUpDtduuamg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wK85cXm2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3220/1%2ASkHlDVmDKsvNUpDtduuamg.png" alt="Delivery By Truck" width="880" height="518"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3→ What will be my Factory Class or Manager Class?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Example, a Delivery Manager will be a factory Class or manager class that is responsible for choosing the delivery method based on package size. According to the definition, we are &lt;strong&gt;letting the subclasses decide which class to instantiate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--c2gpXHMh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2820/1%2A_m88DzHukztmEedH3lzFpQ.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--c2gpXHMh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2820/1%2A_m88DzHukztmEedH3lzFpQ.png" alt="image2" width="880" height="929"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4→ How to test the Factory Design Pattern?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To test our Factory Design Pattern we are giving 3 different packages with different 3 different Packages sizes like &lt;strong&gt;SMALL, LARGE and MEDIUM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Y2kK35B---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3524/1%2ArpLjOp8fAMn_oqXF60Cqbw.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Y2kK35B---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3524/1%2ArpLjOp8fAMn_oqXF60Cqbw.png" alt="image2" width="880" height="725"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 5 →What will be the Output for Factory Pattern?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below console output helps to understand how the Manager(Factory Class) is selecting the mode of transportation based on Package Info&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YbUI89x9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2484/1%2AQNUM6dlmIMFXQ8ZVhliRGQ.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YbUI89x9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2484/1%2AQNUM6dlmIMFXQ8ZVhliRGQ.png" alt="image3" width="880" height="366"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Top 8 Most Important Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms With Python Code References</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/imagescv/top-8-most-important-unsupervised-machine-learning-algorithms-with-python-code-references-egm</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-are-the-most-important-unsupervised-machine-learning-algorithms"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What are the most important unsupervised machine learning algorithms?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, we will list what we believe to be the top 8. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsupervised machine learning means that there is no predefined outcome or label for any data point during training. Without a labeled data set, how does one know which algorithm should be used? There are many possible answers to this question and it all depends on the type of problem you need to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this blog post is to help you figure out which unsupervised machine learning algorithm is best for your problem. We will provide a brief overview and examples as well as details about which algorithms are better suited for specific types of data sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Top unsupervised machine learning algorithms include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-kmeans-clustering"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://realpython.com/k-means-clustering-python/"&gt;1. K-Means Clustering&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The K-means clustering algorithm is one of the most popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms and it is used for data segmentation. It works by partitioning a data set into k clusters, where each cluster has a mean that is computed from the training data. The number of clusters, k, is usually determined through experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The advantage&lt;/strong&gt; of using the K-means clustering algorithm is that it is easy to understand and can be implemented in a short amount of time. Additionally, it does not require any assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data. However, there are some disadvantages to using this algorithm. First, it can be sensitive to initialization values and can result in poor clustering. Second, it is not scalable to large data sets. Lastly, it does not work well with categorical data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-principal-component-analysis-pca"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/pca-using-python-scikit-learn-e653f8989e60"&gt;2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PCA algorithm is used for dimensionality reduction and is commonly used in conjunction with the k-means clustering algorithm. It works by finding a lower dimensional space that contains most of the variation in the original data set. This can be helpful when working with high-dimensional data sets because it reduces the number of dimensions without losing much information. Additionally, using PCA can improve performance on many machine learning algorithms since they are often sensitive to the dimensionality of the input data set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are &lt;strong&gt;some disadvantages to using PCA&lt;/strong&gt;. First, it can be computationally expensive. Second, it is not always possible to reduce the dimensionality of the data set without losing information. Lastly, PCA does not work well with categorical data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-autoencoder"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/06/complete-guide-on-how-to-use-autoencoders-in-python/"&gt;3. AutoEncoder&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AutoEncoder algorithm is a type of neural network that is used for unsupervised learning. It works by taking an input data set and encoding it into a hidden layer. The encoded data is then decoded and compared to the original input data set. If there is a high degree of similarity between the two sets, then the encoder has done its job correctly. Otherwise, the encoder needs to be tuned until there is a high degree of similarity between the two sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The advantage&lt;/strong&gt; of using the AutoEncoder algorithm is that it is able to learn complex patterns in data. Additionally, it is a type of neural network and as such, can be trained using backpropagation. However, there are some disadvantages to using this algorithm. First, it can be computationally expensive. Second, if the encoder and decoder are not similar enough then the algorithm will not perform well. Lastly, it does not work well with categorical data.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://www.codespeedy.com/understanding-deep-belief-networks-in-python/"&gt;4. Deep Belief Networks&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Deep Belief Network (DBN) algorithm is a deep learning algorithm that is used for unsupervised learning. It works by creating a hierarchy of layers where each layer is composed of multiple neurons. The first layer is called the input layer and consists of neurons that are connected to the original data set. The last layer is called the output layer and it consists of neurons that are used for classification or regression depending on whether supervised learning is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The advantage&lt;/strong&gt; of using DBNs is that they can be trained quickly since training only occurs in one direction from input to output layers. Additionally, it works well with problems where there isn't a lot of labeled data available as long as some information about the function being modeled exists. However, there are some disadvantages to using this algorithm such as its ability to overfit large amounts of training data which limits how much neural networks can improve upon themselves without more labeled training sets.. Another problem is that these types of deep networks require a large amount of computation to train. Lastly, it does not work well with categorical data.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://pythonrepo.com/repo/omimo-xRBM-python-deep-learning"&gt;5. Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) algorithm is a type of neural network that is used for unsupervised learning. It works by taking an input data set and splitting it into two parts: the visible layer and the hidden layer. The visible layer consists of neurons that are connected to the original data set while the hidden layer consists of neurons that are not connected to the original data set. The purpose of this algorithm is to learn the relationship between the input and output layers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantage of using RBM algorithms is that they can be used for dimensionality reduction since they often result in lower-dimensional input space. Additionally, they are able to learn complex relationships between the data set and can be trained quickly since only backpropagation is required for training. However, there are some disadvantages to using this type of algorithm such as its inability to create more than one hidden layer. Another problem is that learning cannot occur with unsupervised pre-training methods like AutoEncoders or PCA alone. Lastly, RBM algorithms do not work well with categorical data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://3rdman.de/2020/02/hierarchical-temporal-memory-part-1-getting-started/"&gt;6. Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) algorithm is a type of neural network used for unsupervised learning along with supervised learning problems where labeled examples exist but not enough labels were generated during training time. It works by creating a hierarchy of levels where the lower level nodes represent individual pixels and higher-level nodes represent object classifications such as face, hand or car depending on what is being learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The advantage&lt;/strong&gt; to using HTM algorithms is that they can be used for unsupervised learning while making predictions about entire sequences rather than just single events like other methods do . Additionally, it allows hierarchical learning with multiple levels of abstraction which helps in analyzing data sets more efficiently and working with unknown inputs. However , there are some disadvantages to using this type of algorithm such as long training times compared to traditional neural networks.. Another problem is that this approach does not work well if each successive layer has fewer processing elements than previous layers since these types of layers will not be able to learn anything. Lastly, HTM algorithms are unable to handle categorical data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#7-convolutional-neural-networks-cnns"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/cnn"&gt;7. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of neural network that is used for both unsupervised and supervised learning problems. They work by taking an input image and splitting it into small square tiles called "windows." Each window is then passed through a neuron in the first layer of the CNN which performs a convolution operation on it using a kernel matrix . The output of this layer is then passed through another layer of neurons which perform another convolution operation, this time with a different kernel matrix. This process is repeated until the final layer is reached which produces an output that is a prediction of the input image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The advantage&lt;/strong&gt; to using CNNs is that they are able to learn complex relationships between data sets and can be trained quickly since only backpropagation is required for training. Additionally, they often result in lower-dimensional input spaces than other types of neural networks. However, there are some disadvantages to using this type of algorithm such as its high computational requirements which can make it difficult to train on large data sets. Another problem is that CNNs do not work well with categorical data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#8-support-vector-machines-svms"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/svm-classification-scikit-learn-python"&gt;8. Support Vector Machines (SVMs)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a type of machine learning algorithm that is used for both unsupervised and supervised learning problems. They work by constructing a hyperplane in a high-dimensional space where all the training data points lie on one side of the plane and all the other data points lie on the other side. The purpose of an SVM is to find the best possible hyperplane so that it can correctly classify all the training data points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The advantage&lt;/strong&gt; to using SVMs is that they often result in lower dimensional input spaces than other types of machine learning algorithms. Additionally, they are able to learn complex relationships between data sets and can be trained quickly since only backpropagation is required for training. However, there are some disadvantages to using this type of algorithm such as its high computational requirements which can make it difficult to train on large data sets. Another problem is that SVMs do not work well with categorical data.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SPOTLIGHT: A GENTLE INTRODUCTION TO MACHINE LEARNING CONCEPTS IN PYTHON</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/goodnessuc/spotlight-a-gentle-introduction-to-machine-learning-concepts-in-python-3008</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xmQPkOua--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641381279658/X42-AAETc.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xmQPkOua--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641381279658/X42-AAETc.jpeg" alt="image1.jpeg" width="246" height="205"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial intelligence that deals with the study of computational algorithms and statistical models to perform tasks through patterns and interference instead of explicit tasks. The machine (Your computer) takes in the data and algorithm, learns from it, and then could use it to predict for other new instances. Machine learning is a set of tools used to build models on data that could help predict new types of the same data. Machine learning models are now very popular everywhere. You must have once wondered how Facebook knew that you know someone, or how Spotify got that really cool jam recommended to you. Well, that is machine learning and the same way Facebook could pop up someone you do not know is based on the fact that machine-learning models are not 100% accurate all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine Learning comprises of supervised learning where we know the target or past answer and unsupervised learning where there are no targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we will be covering the basics of machine learning by viewing the basic ways machine learning models carry out operations to give us juicy feedback. This article is on supervised learning, as this is an introduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Concepts below cover the basics of machine learning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#grouping-data-into-features-and%C2%A0targets"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  GROUPING DATA INTO FEATURES AND TARGETS:
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As highlighted earlier, in supervised learning, we aim at predicting values based on past data (target) hence; the dataset with which we work comes with a column, which contains the values, which we are trying to predict. This is the target column. Whilst other columns, which are going to be used to predict the target are called the features. Datasets could be ambiguous, containing useless data, which we would want to get rid of, and here, data analysis and manipulation comes in handy. We would also want to have a good knowledge of the features and we can do this with a good knowledge of exploratory data analysis.&lt;br&gt;
Here is a  &lt;a href="https://medium.com/swlh/intro-to-exploratory-data-analysis-eda-with-python-152a37029a8d"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;  to an article on exploratory data analysis article you might find useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#basic-machine-learning-algorithm-operations"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  BASIC MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM OPERATIONS
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Classification&lt;/strong&gt;: In classification, machine learning models group data into different parts based on the algorithm provided. Popular classification algorithms include the K Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines amongst others and with the help of a concept called cross-validation; we will be able to pick the best one to work with on our data.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Regression&lt;/strong&gt;: Regression algorithms operate by giving out the relationship between two or more features in our model. Examples are linear and logistic regression algorithms.&lt;br&gt;
Regression and classification are categorized under the same umbrella of supervised machine learning. … The main difference between them is that the output variable in regression is numerical (or continuous) while that for classification is categorical (or discrete)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-machine-learning%C2%A0workflow"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  THE MACHINE LEARNING WORKFLOW
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importing&lt;/strong&gt;: By importing, we get the necessary tools we are going to be using on our machine learning model examples are the algorithms and the tools we use for exploratory data analysis&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;from sklearn.linearmodel import LinearRegression

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instantiating&lt;/strong&gt;: This is the process of the creation of an instance of the machine learning method. While some of them accept parameters like the k nearest neighbours, others do not accept parameters.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;my_model = LinearRegression()

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Splitting into training and testing data&lt;/strong&gt;: We split the data into training and testing sets. We go-ahead to work with the training set and then compare them with the testing set to have a glance at how well our model performed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X = feature columns
y = target column
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3) 

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;*train_test_split * does a tuple unpacking of the data. The argument as seen above "test_size" is the portion of the data we are willing to allocate to the machine learning method for training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fit&lt;/strong&gt;: By fitting a model, we are feeding the training set of our data to the algorithm to operate on. We could tune how the algorithm operates of the fitted data. We would fit the training data to the machine learning method.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;my_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predict&lt;/strong&gt;: The goal of using a machine learning algorithm is to be able to get predictions and feedbacks off of it and we do this using the predict method of the machine learning algorithm. Most machine learning algorithms are already sophisticated and ready to use so most of the work a data scientist does is with refining the data for the algorithm. We predict on the X_test from the train_test_split tuple unpacking.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;prediction = my_model.predict(X_test)

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TiGh0dQ3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641381068026/mkLH6LZaR.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TiGh0dQ3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641381068026/mkLH6LZaR.jpeg" alt="robots playing chess" width="332" height="152"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#evaluating-a-models-performance"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  EVALUATING A MODEL'S PERFORMANCE
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Classification report&lt;/strong&gt;: A classification report is a metric that gives a table of how well the algorithm performed in percentages. The table contains the precision, recall, and the f1 score. The precision column tells us the percentage score of how well the algorithm classified our model accurately. The recall column gives us feedback on how the algorithm classified data that did not belong to a category while the f1 score is a harmonic mean of the precision and recall. A classification report comes in handy for model evaluation, as it is simple to obtain.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
print(classification_report(y_test,predictions))

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NlbKfEGd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641380782441/JzHCzd33V.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NlbKfEGd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641380782441/JzHCzd33V.png" alt="An example of a classification report" width="700" height="380"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The confusion matrix&lt;/strong&gt;: The confusion matrix method is used to summarize how the algorithm performed on our data. In a confusion matrix, the rows correspond to values the algorithm predicted while the columns correspond to the known truths (actuals). Values on the diagonal specify where the algorithm correctly classified our data while the others show where the algorithm failed. Using the confusion matrix we can compare how well different algorithms perform on our data and then go ahead to select the algorithm that best suits our data.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
print(confusion_matrix(y_test,predictions))

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--z5-v0Mfn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641380705302/QVdI4miKkz.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--z5-v0Mfn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641380705302/QVdI4miKkz.png" alt="confusion matrix" width="312" height="161"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-Validation&lt;/strong&gt;: Cross-Validation allows us to compare different machine learning methods and get a sense of how well they will work in practice which helps us choose the machine learning algorithm that best suits our data. Cross-validation does this by splitting the data into training and testing sets. Splitting the data into n numbers, the type of cross-validation is the n cross-validation since the number of splits is arbitrary. Cross-validation uses every part of the split data to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bias and Variance&lt;/strong&gt;: Bias is the inability of a machine learning method to capture the true relationship between features. Variance is the difference in fits between different datasets. In machine learning, a good algorithm is one with a low bias, can accurately model the true relationship, and has low variability (it should be able to provide consistently good predictions over different datasets). When there is a case of a high bias and low variance, the model is under-fitted and when there are a low bias and a high variance, the model is over-fit. Trading bias for variance and vice-versa is a &lt;em&gt;Bias Variance Trade-off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--02SWfsk0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641380581896/1LcR0Cv8f.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--02SWfsk0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641380581896/1LcR0Cv8f.jpeg" alt="" width="259" height="194"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With knowledge of these basic concepts, learning other machine learning methods would be quite easy.&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Virtual Background in Android with WebRTC</title>
      <author>Nilay Jayswal</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 11:10:12 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/100mslive/virtual-background-in-android-with-webrtc-5720</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/100mslive/virtual-background-in-android-with-webrtc-5720</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Virtual backgrounds are becoming necessary nowadays in the video conferencing world. It allows us to replace our natural background with an image or a video. We can also upload our custom images in the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog, we are going to implement Virtual Background in Android with WebRTC using &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/selfie-segmentation/android"&gt;mlkit selfie segmentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This content was originally published - &lt;a href="https://www.100ms.live/blog/virtual-background-in-android-with-webrtc"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feature works best with uniform lightning condition in background and requires a high-performance mobile android device for a smooth user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By end of this blog, you can expect the virtual background feature to look like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SAKS4Qg5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lmkrzidhzw9n78dxw4ee.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SAKS4Qg5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lmkrzidhzw9n78dxw4ee.gif" alt="Image description" width="340" height="624"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dependencies"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Dependencies
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the dependencies for the ML Kit Android libraries to the module's app-level gradle file, which is usually &lt;code&gt;app/build.gradle&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
dependencies {  implementation 'com.google.mlkit:segmentation-selfie:16.0.0-beta3'}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Add the dependencies for the libyuv.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;dependencies {  implementation 'io.github.zncmn.libyuv:core:0.0.7'}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;libyuv is an open-source project that includes YUV scaling and conversion functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#common-webrtc-terms-you-should-know"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Common WebRTC terms you should know
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VideoFrame: It contains the buffer of the frame captured by the camera device in I420 format.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VideoSink :  It is used to send the frame back to &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API"&gt;WebRTC&lt;/a&gt; native source.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VideoSource : It reads the camera device, produces VideoFrames, and deliver them to VideoSinks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VideoProcessor : It is an interface provided by WebRTC to update videoFrames produced by videoSource .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MediaStream : It is an API related to WebRTC which provides support for streaming audio and video data. It consists of zero or more &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack"&gt;MediaStreamTrack&lt;/a&gt; objects, representing various audio or video tracks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#approaches-we-thought-of"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Approaches we thought of
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updating the WebRTC MediaStream by passing it to the mlkit selfie segmentation model and getting the updated stream. But sadly we don’t have a method in android to replaceTrack in WebRTC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updating the stream coming from the source camera and then passing it to WebRTC. Got some success on it, but then issues were faced in using the updated stream in the WebRTC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating another virtual video source from the camera source and using that as an input to mlkit API . But sending the updated stream back to WebRTC gave us issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/training/camerax"&gt;Android CameraX Apis&lt;/a&gt; to read frames but again WebRTC doesn't support it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After trying all these approaches and not getting suitable results, we figured out that we need to do processing on VideoFrame for our use case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#getting-the-videoframe-from-webrtc"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Getting the VideoFrame from WebRTC
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most challenging part was getting the VideoFrame out for every frame from WebRTC for processing. After a lot of research we found out that we can use setVideoProcessor API available with VideoSource. It has few callbacks&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;//It gives us VideoFrame going into WebRTC for every frame
fun onFrameCaptured(inputVideoFrame: VideoFrame?)

//It gives us sink which we will use to send updated videoFrame back to //WebRTC
fun setSink(sink: VideoSink?)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is how we can setVideoProcessor to VideoSource(source in below code snippet is VideoSource)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt; source.setVideoProcessor(object : VideoProcessor {
            override fun onCapturerStarted(p0: Boolean) {

            }
            override fun onCapturerStopped() {

            }
            override fun onFrameCaptured(inputVideoFrame: VideoFrame?) {
              //Do processing with inputVideoFrame here
            }
            override fun setSink(sink: VideoSink?) {
              //set sink here to send updated videoFrame back to WebRTC 
            }
        })
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If we are setting VideoProcessor to the VideoSource we need to call onFrame callback on every frame from VideoSink otherwise, we will get a black screen on our device.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;//Here frame is the updated VideoFrame we are getting after ML processing //on input videoFrame
sink.onFrame(frame)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#converting-videoframe-to-supported-ml-model-input-type"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Converting VideoFrame to supported ML model Input Type
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To perform segmentation on an image, mlkit needs an &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/mlkit/vision/common/InputImage"&gt;InputImage&lt;/a&gt; object which can be created from either a bitmap, bytebuffer, media.Image, byte array, or a file on the device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, we have converted inputVideoFrame into a bitmap using &lt;a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/libyuv/libyuv/"&gt;libyuv&lt;/a&gt; library&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YuvFrame:&lt;/strong&gt; It copies the Y, V and U planes from videoFrame buffer into a byte array which we are converting to ARGB_8888 Bitmap&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;yuvFrame = YuvFrame(
                inputVideoFrame,
                YuvFrame.PROCESSING_NONE,
                inputVideoFrame.timestampNs
            )
 inputFrameBitmap = yuvFrame.bitmap
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now we have created InputImage using inputFrameBitmap&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;val mlImage = InputImage.fromBitmap(inputFrameBitmap, 0)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#initialise-mlkit-model"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Initialise mlkit model
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have created an instance of Segmenter using &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/selfie-segmentation/android#1_create_an_instance_of_segmenter"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#process-the-mlimage"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Process the mlImage
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;segmenter.process( mlImage )
            .addOnSuccessListener { segmentationMask -&amp;gt;
                val mask = segmentationMask.buffer
                val maskWidth = segmentationMask.width
                val maskHeight = segmentationMask.height
                mask.rewind()
                val arr: IntArray = maskColorsFromByteBuffer(mask, maskWidth, maskHeight)
                val segmentedBitmap = Bitmap.createBitmap(
                    arr, maskWidth, maskHeight, Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888
                )
            //segmentedBitmap is the person segmented from background
            }
            .addOnFailureListener { exception -&amp;gt;
                HMSLogger.e( "App" , "${exception.message}" )
            }
            .addOnCompleteListener {
            }

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#draw-the-segmented-background-on-the-canvas"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Draw the segmented background on the canvas
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have used &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/PorterDuff.Mode"&gt;Porter.Duff&lt;/a&gt; mode to draw segmented output with the background image given by user on the Canvas(using &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Canvas"&gt;canvas&lt;/a&gt; APIs)&lt;br&gt;
After this we will get outputBitmap from canvas which we are using to create an updated VideoFrame&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-new-videoframe-from-outputbitmap"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Create new VideoFrame from outputBitmap
&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;surfTextureHelper?.handler?.post() {
                GLES20.glTexParameteri(
                    GLES20.GL_TEXTURE_2D,
                    GLES20.GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER,
                    GLES20.GL_NEAREST
                )
                GLES20.glTexParameteri(
                    GLES20.GL_TEXTURE_2D,
                    GLES20.GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER,
                    GLES20.GL_NEAREST
                )
                GLUtils.texImage2D(GLES20.GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, outputBitmap, 0)

                val i420Buf = yuvConverter.convert(inputBuffer)
                val outputVideoFrame = VideoFrame(i420Buf, 180, frameTs)                //180 is the frame rotation degree which we are using
            }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#send-videoframe-back-to-webrtc"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Send VideoFrame back to WebRTC
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will replace the input video feed with the background supplied on both local and remote&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;sink.onFrame(outputVideoFrame)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#time-taken"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Time taken
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole pipeline takes less than 20ms per frame on One Plus 6 (Android).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#optimizations"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Optimizations
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the processing time is taken by input VideoFrame to YuvFrame conversion. Since the real-time view doesn't change much on every frame, there is no point in doing this conversion on every frame. The previous converted YuvFrame can be easily used for processing. It helps in enhancing the performance and user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello Coders! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article presents a few commands we can execute inside the &lt;strong&gt;Flask Shell&lt;/strong&gt; that might help us understand the structure and the business logic of a legacy web app. We might need this when we start working on a new project designed or coded in the past or when our own web app is getting bigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading! Topics covered: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;👉 Flask - Short introduction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;👉 Flask CLI (command line interface)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;👉 List Registered Models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;👉 List Table Columns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#flask-intro"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ✨ Flask Intro
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. Getting started with Flask is pretty easy. Once we have Python3 installed and a modern code editor like VsCode or Atom we can write our first web app.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;pip &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;flask
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The above command will install the latest version of Flask via PIP, the official package manager for Python.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Contents of - app.py
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;flask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Flask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;escape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Flask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'/'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'Hello from Flask!'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once the file is saved, we can invoke Flask magic using the command:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;flask run
 &lt;span class="k"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Press CTRL+C to quit&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;






&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#flask-cli"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ✨ Flask CLI
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flask provides a convenient way to interact with all app internals via a simple command-line interface powered by the &lt;code&gt;Click&lt;/code&gt; package. To invoke the CLI, we need to execute the following command:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;shell&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# The shell is waiting for our commands
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;






&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;👉 Flask CLI - &lt;code&gt;List Routes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;shell&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;url_map&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Rule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'/register.html'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HEAD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;OPTIONS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;register&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Rule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'/logout.html'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HEAD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;OPTIONS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;logout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;db&lt;/code&gt; object holds the &lt;code&gt;SqlAlchemy&lt;/code&gt; interface and we will pull the information via this object.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;shell&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;






&lt;p&gt;In my project, we have a single &lt;code&gt;Users&lt;/code&gt; table - let's take a look at the definition:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;metadata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tables&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'Users'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'Users'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;MetaData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Column&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'id'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Users&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;primary_key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;nullable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Column&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'user'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;64&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Users&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Column&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'email'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;120&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Users&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Column&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'password'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/harshitkhaladk1/simple-calculator-with-dark-mode-5gpp</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi Guys Wish you Happy  Year 🎊. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Here's a simple calculator built using HTML, CSS and obviously, JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This calculator also has dark mode which looks really good. And here's how you can do that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;HTML&lt;/h1&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;html lang="en"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;

    &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Simple JS Calculator&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Open+Sans:wght@600&amp;amp;display=swap" rel="stylesheet"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="light.css" id="theme"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;script src="script.js"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class="container"&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Calculator&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;div class="row-1"&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;input type="text" id="result" placeholder="Result" readonly&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;button onclick="clearScreen()" id="clear" &amp;gt;C&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;div class="btnrow-1"&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;button onclick="updScreen(1)"&amp;gt;1&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;button onclick="updScreen(2)"&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;button onclick="updScreen(3)"&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;button onclick="updScreen('*')"&amp;gt;x&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;div class="btnrow-1"&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;button onclick="updScreen(4)" &amp;gt;4&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;button onclick="updScreen(5)" &amp;gt;5&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;button onclick="updScreen(6)" &amp;gt;6&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;button onclick="updScreen('+')"&amp;gt;+&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;div class="btnrow-1"&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;button onclick="updScreen(7)"&amp;gt;7&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;button onclick="updScreen(8)"&amp;gt;8&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;button onclick="updScreen(9)"&amp;gt;9&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;button onclick="updScreen('-')"&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;div class="btnrow-2"&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;button onclick="updScreen('/')" &amp;gt;/&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;button onclick="updScreen(0)" &amp;gt;0&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;button onclick="updScreen('.')"&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;button onclick="result.value = eval(result.value)"&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;div class="btnrow-1"&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;button onclick="themeSwitcher()" id="dark-mode" &amp;gt;Turn on Dark Mode&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lcUionYi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n4uyq232y9u0blkfpou1.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lcUionYi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n4uyq232y9u0blkfpou1.jpg" alt='A pie chart showing 40% responded "Yes", 50% responded "No" and 10% responded "Not sure"' width="880" height="541"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#css"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  CSS
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now made two css file &lt;br&gt;
1) Light Mode&lt;br&gt;
2) Dark Mode&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#heres-the-css-for-light-mode"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Here's the CSS for Light Mode
&lt;/h2&gt;

}



// Display updates in Result Input

function updScreen(val) {

 document.getElementById("result")
  .value = x + val;

}



// Switch between Dark and Light Modes

function themeSwitcher() {

 var dark = document.getElementById(

 var th = document.getElementById(
  "theme");

 if (th.getAttribute('href') ==
  'light.css') {

  th.href = 'dark.css';

  dark.innerHTML =

  dark.innerHTML =
   'Turn on Dark mode';

 }

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That's it. Now we have a simple calculator with dark mode. Thanks for reading. Hope you like it! If you have any problems, you can definitely comment and ask me. I will definitely help you.&lt;br&gt;

      <title>What way should I choose React Native or Flutter</title>
      <author>maheenriaz</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 10:55:36 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/zenkoders/what-way-should-i-choose-react-native-or-flutter-4h5e</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/zenkoders/what-way-should-i-choose-react-native-or-flutter-4h5e</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this blog, we will discuss two top-rank frameworks i.e. React Native and Flutter. Earlier we needed time, money, and skills to develop cross-platform applications. But nowadays companies need the fastest way to develop native apps. To develop native apps, we must know JAVA for android and SWIFT for ios which waste our time. React native and flutter give us the advantage to write a single code and deploy it to various platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#flutter"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Flutter:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a single codebase in a flutter, we create natively-compiled apps for mobile and desktop. Google has recently developed cross-platform mobile app development. Dart is the programming language used by flutter. It enables the creation of expressive and flexible user interfaces with native performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--R1FfhJrM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/00jdn2x0vol1t7juxexy.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--R1FfhJrM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/00jdn2x0vol1t7juxexy.png" alt="flutter" width="880" height="433"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#react-native"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  React Native:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React Native is an open-source framework developed by Facebook and it runs on javascript. The main focus of this framework is the native application rendering that is primarily compatible with Android and iOS. React native is based upon React JS which is a factor of native code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Jm3EraMt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ybgcvg98b26whcm6iyz6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Jm3EraMt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ybgcvg98b26whcm6iyz6.png" alt="reactnative" width="880" height="461"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#programming-language-difference"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Programming Language Difference:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#react-native"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  React Native:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React native uses javascript. It is easier for developers to move on to react-native because of javascript as compared to dart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#flutter"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Flutter:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flutter uses dart language. It is just like the C language/JAVA. Dart is not used much nowadays. It supports object-oriented programming like abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance. Dart bridge is larger but it runs faster as compared to javascript bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#advantages-of-react-native"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Advantages of React Native:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-changes-are-visible-immediately"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Changes Are Visible Immediately:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React native uses hot reloading or live reloading. When a user makes any changes in the code, changes will be visible to the developer immediately which is the main advantage to seeing the real-time changes in the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-adding-to-an-existing-app"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Adding to an Existing App:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we already have an app and we want to improve that app. We don't need to re-create that app. By using React Native, we can add components that we had to create in our app. It saves our time and money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-flexibility"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Flexibility:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React-native makes it easy for developers to pick up where someone left the work and start coding. It increases the flexibility of developers and improves the performance of mobile applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-support-3rd-party-libraries"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Support 3rd Party libraries:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React native allows using 3rd party libraries using a native module and javascript module. If you want to add dynamic charts in react native apps, you can easily add them in your application using 3rd party libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#disadvantages-of-react-native"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Disadvantages of React Native:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-takes-longer-time-to-get-started"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Takes longer time to get started:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React native takes a long time to initialize the app because of the javascript thread. Any kind of user interaction like events, API response. The longer the API response, it will block the user thread and slow the performance of mobile applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-it-is-insecure-in-terms-of-security"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. It is insecure in terms of security:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React native creates a vulnerability in the security of the system. If you are creating finance and banking apps you don't need to choose to react-native because for the banking app the data is confidential and we need security for confidential data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-its-a-difficult-task-to-learn-the-react-native"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. It's a Difficult Task to Learn the React Native:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a newcomer in the field of development then it will be hard to learn to react-native because of JSX. JSX contains Html with javascript. In comparison to other cross-platform apps, it will be difficult for the ordinary student to learn to react-native.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#advantages-of-flutter"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Advantages of flutter:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-fast-reloading"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Fast Reloading:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flutter provides fast reloading after changes are made in the application. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-open-source"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Open source:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flutter is open-source and free to use. They provide substantial documentation and a large community that helps you to solve any problem you might run into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-productivity-is-high"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Productivity is high:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may utilize the same code base for your iOS and Android apps because Flutter is cross-platform. This will undoubtedly save you time and money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-compatibility"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Compatibility:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since widgets are the part of flutter app. That's why we will experience fewer compatibility issues on different operating systems which saves time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#disadvantages-of-flutter"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Disadvantages of Flutter:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-not-suitable-for-web-apps"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Not suitable for web apps:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Browsers do not currently support Flutter-based applications. This implies you won't be able to use any web applications. It also does not support watchOS and tvOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-its-a-difficult-task-to-learn-the-dart"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. It's a Difficult Task to Learn the Dart:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dart is a lesser-known programming language, yet it is necessary to master it to work with Flutter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-does-not-support-3rd-party-libraries"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Does Not support 3rd party libraries:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does not support 3rd party libraries which increases the programming tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-large-app-size"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Large App size:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;flutter app size is larger than 5MB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#apps-that-are-built-on-react-native"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Apps that are built on React Native:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook&lt;br&gt;
Instagram&lt;br&gt;
Skype&lt;br&gt;
Uber Eats&lt;br&gt;
Wix&lt;br&gt;
Tesla&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#apps-that-are-built-on-flutter"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Apps that are built on Flutter:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton&lt;br&gt;
Lunching&lt;br&gt;
Reflectly&lt;br&gt;
Google Ads&lt;br&gt;
Xianyu by Alibaba&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-we-create-a-flutter-app"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How we create a Flutter app:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, open a terminal and run these commands:&lt;br&gt;
$ flutter create my_app&lt;br&gt;
$ flutter analyze&lt;br&gt;
$ flutter test&lt;br&gt;
$ flutter run lib/main.dart&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-we-create-react-native-app"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How we create react native app:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, open terminal and run these commands:&lt;br&gt;
$ npx react-native init new_project&lt;br&gt;
$ cd new_project&lt;br&gt;
$ react-native run-android&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>It's Here! Announcing the Release of Appwrite 0.12!</title>
      <author>Eldad A. Fux</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 10:37:45 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/appwrite/its-here-announcing-the-release-of-appwrite-012-5c8b</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/appwrite/its-here-announcing-the-release-of-appwrite-012-5c8b</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We're excited to share that Appwrite 0.12 is now officially available! The new Appwrite version includes our &lt;strong&gt;biggest ever performance improvements&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;enhanced developer experience&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;many new features&lt;/strong&gt; designed to make developers' lives easier. Trust us, this one's a biggie! In addition, the latest release includes over 1,500 commits and contributions from 29 new contributors that have helped make this release possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#database-on-steroids"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🧪 Database on Steroids
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In version 0.12, we have &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; rewritten the Appwrite data management layer. We have improved the internal data structures, background workers, and we’ve enabled new concepts such as attributes (instead of rules) and indexes to allow maximum performance and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ejfCuoP6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mri55xtzr37e6bz14ocf.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ejfCuoP6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mri55xtzr37e6bz14ocf.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="578"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve also added a new easy-to-understand query syntax. The new syntax allows new capabilities, like OR statements, and opens the door for the core team to implement many more advanced features we’re passionate about, like &lt;code&gt;includes&lt;/code&gt; operator and GEO-based queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team has done a lot of work to enable other databases providers, and we hope to release support for more loved databases soon. A major part of our agenda is to enable dev teams the comfort and confidence to use Appwrite the way they wish to, with tools they already love, know, and feel confident with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new database does introduce some breaking changes before we move to version 1.0. Please take time to review the list of changes and our &lt;a href="https://dev.to/appwrite/appwrite-012-migration-post-3cha"&gt;migration tutorial&lt;/a&gt;. To support existing Appwrite users we'll continue to support the 0.11 branch for at least the next six months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pagination-just-got-a-lot-faster"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  📑 Pagination Just Got A LOT Faster!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Appwrite 0.12, we are happy to introduce the new cursor pagination strategy. While the traditional offset and limit pagination is very intuitive and easy to understand it doesn’t &lt;a href="https://www.eversql.com/faster-pagination-in-mysql-why-order-by-with-limit-and-offset-is-slow/"&gt;scale well&lt;/a&gt;. To tackle this problem, we have limited the limit+offset pagination to a maximum of 5,000 documents. With this limit, you can still use the offset+limit pagination for small dataset, but as your data grows, you can migrate to the new cursor pagination that scales very well with almost no regard to your collection size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chart below demonstrates how significant this performance difference can be on a collection containing &lt;strong&gt;1M documents&lt;/strong&gt;. The bigger the dataset, the bigger the difference, and now Appwrite can allow you to scale your pagination with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bJ6WKBio--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gy7j3oexkncs4irn1kcc.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bJ6WKBio--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gy7j3oexkncs4irn1kcc.png" alt="Cursor vs Offset Pagination" width="880" height="442"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new change will apply to all the Appwrite resources where pagination is possible. Whether it's your custom collections, list of files, users, functions and other relevant resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#permissions-are-easier-and-more-flexible"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🚧 Permissions are Easier and More Flexible
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we initially designed Appwrite, we wanted to have a simple declarative permission model that is also secure by default. With the release of Appwrite 0.12, we're happy to introduce the next evolution of the Appwrite permissions: &lt;strong&gt;Permission Models&lt;/strong&gt;. You will now be able to choose between two different permission models for your collections, &lt;strong&gt;collection-level permissions&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;document-level permissions&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zP6k5IrD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q7p6tj82pekwivp2iu5c.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zP6k5IrD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q7p6tj82pekwivp2iu5c.png" alt="Appwrite's Permission Models" width="880" height="578"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're already familiar with Appwrite, the document-level model will act in the same way as you already know. Each document can have read and write permissions that define which Appwrite entity (user/team/role) has access to each operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new &lt;strong&gt;Collection Level&lt;/strong&gt; model introduces new and easier to use collection permissions. Using the collection permissions, you only need to set the read and write permissions once. In addition, the collections permission will act the same for all the documents regardless of any permissions that may have been set on a specific document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new model offers more flexibility for other use cases, which may not require you to leverage the original, document-level permissions. The new collection-level permission can also lead to enhanced performance as the Appwrite API is not required to validate each permission individually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#%F0%9F%8E%9B-more-dashboards-and-more-control"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🎛 More Dashboards, and More Control
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TIo3oHIV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7htmepbs9quia7lfho36.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TIo3oHIV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7htmepbs9quia7lfho36.png" alt="Appwrite's Usage Stats" width="880" height="578"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have upgraded the Appwrite console with more dashboards with your Appwrite projects' usage metrics. This is the first of many upgrades where we aim to make more usage metrics easily available through the console. Using our new dashboards, you can quickly get insights into your project performance, size, and cost. In addition, the new dashboard will now show data for your entire project, files, users, collections and documents over time. We've also added charts for your &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete"&gt;CRUD operations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#anyone-ask-for-custom-ids"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🤟 Anyone Ask for Custom IDs?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Custom IDs were probably one of the most requested features we’ve ever got. Now they're here! With custom IDs, you can define human-readable IDs on most Appwrite resources including users, teams, functions, projects, files, collections, and documents. If you still want to use the previous unique IDs, you can use the reserved &lt;code&gt;unique()&lt;/code&gt; keyword.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SlYcie_r--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/w9g9eor5pqtw6o0mfkme.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SlYcie_r--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/w9g9eor5pqtw6o0mfkme.png" alt="Appwrite's Custom IDs" width="880" height="578"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With custom IDs, you can have a much smoother development experience. Instead of using meaningless strings in your code, you can now use proper naming conventions that allow you to easily migrate your code between different Appwrite environments without managing complex configuration files or programmatic setups for your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#your-services-your-choice"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ✅ Your Services, Your Choice!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3mR8J8Jp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/98grnzummhp5xn9myt8a.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3mR8J8Jp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/98grnzummhp5xn9myt8a.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="578"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We always wanted Appwrite to play well with other tools. However, we understand that one tool can’t always be the right solution to every problem. For that reason, we’ve created our server API, Cloud Functions, and our Microservice architecture that enables you to use Appwrite alongside your existing stack and even your own backend server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With version 0.12, Appwrite became more flexible by allowing you to choose which Appwrite services you wish to enable or disable. This is also a great security feature designed to reduce your attack surface by blocking services and resources you don’t consume. You can visit the new &lt;code&gt;Services&lt;/code&gt; section from your project settings and choose which services to use. For convenience, each project you own can have different settings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introducing-logging-providers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🚨 Introducing Logging Providers!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Error logging and monitoring are crucial for any application, Appwrite being no exception. We wanted to make it extremely easy to collect and monitor your logs while staying true to our philosophy of being completely platform agnostic. With Appwrite 0.12, we've introduced support for some amazing open source logging providers like &lt;a href="https://sentry.io"&gt;Sentry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://raygun.com/"&gt;Raygun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.appsignal.com/"&gt;AppSignal&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2STd5Z6J--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0vp1holzdty548j4ld4e.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2STd5Z6J--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0vp1holzdty548j4ld4e.png" alt="Loggers" width="880" height="440"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're always on the lookout for more logging providers and we'd love your contributions to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/utopia-php/logger"&gt;logging library&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#learn-more"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  📚 Learn More
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appwrite 0.12 includes many more features, bug fixes, and security patches you should really care about that just can’t fit in one blog post. You can learn more by reviewing our &lt;a href="https://github.com/appwrite/appwrite/blob/master/CHANGES.md"&gt;official release notes&lt;/a&gt;. In the next couple of weeks, we will continue the Appwrite 0.12 release party with more content, events, and demos created by the core team to highlight the different features and powerful capabilities in this new version of Appwrite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#%F0%9F%97%82%EF%B8%8F-whats-next"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🗂⚡️☁️ What's Next?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like Appwrite 0.12, you will love Appwrite 0.13! Appwrite 0.12 release will enable us more flexibility and solid foundations to take Appwrite to new places, never seen in the backend-as-a-service space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appwrite 0.13&lt;/strong&gt; will be the first release of many to enjoy the perks of the hard work the Appwrite core team with over 500 collaborators have done for the Appwrite project and ecosystem. The next version will include some very cool features like &lt;strong&gt;buckets support&lt;/strong&gt; for the Appwrite storage, more flexibility with new &lt;strong&gt;storage devices&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Sync &amp;amp; Async serverless functions&lt;/strong&gt; that have been highly requested, and amazing performance boost thanks to our improved function &lt;strong&gt;execution model&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;new runtimes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beside the upcoming releases and features, we’ve just recently announced the ability to sign up and be the first to use the upcoming Appwrite Cloud. The &lt;strong&gt;Appwrite Cloud&lt;/strong&gt; is already in the works, and once available it will provide the easiest way to build on top of Appwrite and to scale your backend effortlessly. You can learn more on our new dedicated landing page for the &lt;a href="https://appwrite.io/cloud"&gt;Appwrite Cloud&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>11 Blogposts That Changed How I Lead Software Teams in 2021</title>
      <author>Samuel James</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 10:34:19 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/abiodunjames/11-blogposts-that-changed-how-i-lead-software-teams-in-2021-1min</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nRpXItwO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/p086kcm76oxbc4z2mov1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nRpXItwO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/p086kcm76oxbc4z2mov1.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="880"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://icons8.com/"&gt;Image Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, I broke my records of daily reading per month. It was the year I read the most book. It was also the year I read the most articles. In 2021, I was fortunate enough to come across really great posts and books that have changed my perspectives on leading software teams and becoming a better software engineer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I’ll share some of these posts because I believe there are ideas and new learnings that make you a better engineer, a better engineering manager, or a better CTO. There is something in it for everyone even if you’re just starting your career or a veteran in the industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#getting-the-best-out-of-these-posts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Getting the Best Out of These Posts
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frequently, I find myself in a situation I could use some insights from what I’ve learned, and I completely forgot them. I’ve developed a process that helped me remember what I read and make them stick. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you through each post, I recommend doing the following to the get best out of each:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Sq6HKnH9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i2lj91yutkli0zgb2eh6.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Sq6HKnH9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i2lj91yutkli0zgb2eh6.jpeg" alt="Image description" width="612" height="612"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Know what you’re reading. Read what the introduction is about and note that what you’ll learn at the end. This will help prepare your mind for the insights to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identify and jot down key ideas and information in the post. Write down learnings, insights, and ideas.  Taking notes of what you learn prompts you to think about your learning and also improves your memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make your notes searchable. You’ll need to find something in the notes someday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Re-read your notes often and when you forget something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/readme/guides/effective-communication"&gt;Effective communication is not about what you say – Melanie Ensign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communication is very crucial to leading effectively. But there is a clear difference between merely passing a message across and communicating effectively. The outcome of any communication is what determines how effective it is. Simply pushing out a message or publishing information is not enough to measure its impact. Effective communication is focused on what people need to hear in order to reach the outcome you desire and less on what you say. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.squareup.com/blog/you-are-your-own-best-hype-person"&gt;You Are Your Own Best Hype Person – Marie Chatfield&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One valuable lesson I learned a while ago is no one lights a candle and puts it under a bushel. It’s for the reasons that organizations invest a lot of resources in marketing their products and brands.  At some point in any engineer’s career, you’re going to have to prove to someone that you’re worth it: worth hiring, worth promoting, worth the raise, worth taking a risk on. The better you’re at making known what you do to others (that’s hyping yourself), the higher your chances of succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/dont-lead-by-example"&gt;Don’t Lead By Example – James Coling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re often told to lead by example. Yes, we all need to set good examples for people to follow. Often time, we overstep our boundaries by continuously taking the lead without setting expectations leaving reports feeling crowded out or disempowered. This post helped me to understand that setting a good example is necessary, but isn’t sufficient for strong technical leadership. Acting like a tech lead means setting clear expectations and embracing direct communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://xdg.me/leading-without-managing/"&gt;Leading Without Managing – David Golden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julie Zhuo in her book defines Leadership as being able to guide and influence other people. When most think of leading, they think of it as something that people in authority or engineers who wear manager of tech lead hats do. Contrary to that, anyone can be a leader. It’s a skill anyone can learn. One of the keys I learned last year through the post was anyone can lead without having the authority or coercive power and how to lead without authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://theskip.substack.com/p/three-crucial-skills-that-leaders"&gt;Three Crucial Skills Leaders Must Develop to Become Executives – Nikhyl Singhal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Executive skills are subtle and can be elusive to managers, demanding a great deal of focus, courage, and dedication. Becoming a great executive requires a set of skills beyond what's needed to be a leader. Nikhyl Singhalin, in this post, shares crucial skills that leaders must develop to become executives. Some of the key takeaways are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to take risks and constantly put yourself in new, challenging, and increasingly ambiguous settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to build strong relationships with other senior people who work in entirely different functions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to build teams and trust the people in them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://betterprogramming.pub/10-admirable-attributes-of-a-great-technical-lead-251d13a8843b"&gt;10 Admirable Attributes of a Great Technical Lead – Elye&lt;/a&gt; (Medium Paywall)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It takes a lot of effort to be a great tech lead. It's a delicate balancing act between two poles of the same attribute. If there is too much weight on one side, the person may fall". This post outlines ten attributes that will make any tech lead a better one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://shekhargulati.com/2021/01/03/being-chief-technology-officer-lessons-learned-in-my-first-year/"&gt;Being a Chief Technology Officer: Lessons Learned in My First Year – Shekhar Gulati&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Most people are not lucky to have a manual handed over to them when stepping into a leadership role. As one climbs the ladder, one begins to notice what is required to succeed at this role is slightly different from what makes one an excellent individual contributor. One of the lessons I found valuable in this post includes picking your battles wisely and getting things done without doing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://shopify.engineering/building-mental-models"&gt;Building Mental Models of Ideas That Don’t Change – Hammad Khalid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Individual Contributors and Engineering Managers, there is always new stuff to learn. If you’re at the beginning of your career, it can be overwhelming. One approach to stay above the water is finding a way to prioritise what to learn and a way of keeping track of principles or ideas that don’t change (that’s mental models) to make better and informed decisions.  This post outlines a list of engineering principles and management principles, some of which that took me years to learn.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://softstuff.tools/"&gt;A Collection of How-Tos, Templates, and Articles to Help You Be the Manager and Leader Your Team Needs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This link contains a collection of todos, how-tos, templates, and articles for engineering managers and tech leads. The categories covered include techniques and templates for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conducting interviews&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conducting meetings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building diversity and inclusion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recruiting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building Culture &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growth and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/lpasqualis/11-top-responsibilities-and-10-common-mistakes-of-a-technical-leader-9po"&gt;11 Top Responsibilities and 10 Common Mistakes of a Technical Leader– Lorenzo Pasqualis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Similar to building a Lego tower, building software requires making decisions from the beginning to the end. The first responsibility of a technical leader is to define the engineering reality: What needs to be built, the general technical direction, an example of the golden standard for productivity and technical excellence, the business and technological context, and the time and resource constraints.”   If you’re a Tech Lead or an Engineering Manager, you’ll find this post interesting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebalancecareers.com/succeeding-on-your-first-day-as-a-manager-2276172"&gt;First Day Success Manual for New Managers – John Reh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen managers and senior engineers setting themselves up for failure immediately after they joined a new team. They start by criticising the existing codebase, past practices, and wanting to implement tons of their processes from day one.  Criticising past practices no matter how ineffective they seem is one of the many ways new hires set themselves up for failure. I love the post because it outlines how to prepare for making a good impression ranging from meeting the team, to attitude and culture.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#where-to-go-from-here-join-software-leads-newsletter"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Where To Go From Here: Join Software Leads' Newsletter
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To take your learnings further, Join the &lt;a href="https://softwareleads.substack.com/"&gt;Software Leads’ newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, a monthly newsletter on software engineering and leadership.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every month, I publish a new issue that includes links to interesting articles, use cases, and insights from experts on leading teams and solving common software engineering challenges at scale. Together, we learn and become better software engineers, better software leads, better engineering managers, and CTOs by making fewer mistakes as we learn from one another&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HTML→ The riddles of the sphinx</title>
      <author>Manu Martinez</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 10:22:47 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/whitehatdevv/html-the-riddles-of-the-sphinx-12de</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/whitehatdevv/html-the-riddles-of-the-sphinx-12de</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello friends! Today we are going to talk about forms, yes! because data is also collected through the web, but this is not the only way, and we will see it in another post... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A web form basically works and looks similar to a form like the one made by telephone companies, or any other, which spend hours and hours calling to offer you their services. 😒😓 &lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web form is composed of one or more control elements (sometimes called widgets), plus some additional elements that help to structure the overall form; they can be single or multi-line text fields, drop-down boxes, buttons, checkboxes or radio buttons, and they are mainly created with the  element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we create a form? Pay attention, don't get lost! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; We create the form with the  tag.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;form&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
......
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We add the "control" elements.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;for=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"fname"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;First name:&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"text"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"fname"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"fname"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;for=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"lname"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Last name:&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"text"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"lname"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"lname"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; A button to &lt;em&gt;"validate"&lt;/em&gt; (submit)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"submit"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;value=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Submit"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; and that's it! The form is ready.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;form&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;for=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"fname"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;First name:&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"text"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"fname"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"fname"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;for=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"lname"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Last name:&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"text"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"lname"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"lname"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"submit"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;value=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Submit"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6sYA9-as--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641303382354/IAdW6RE7k.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6sYA9-as--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641303382354/IAdW6RE7k.jpeg" alt="formulariomanu.jpg" width="800" height="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A validation button is nothing more than a form element that allows data to be sent to the server for processing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many more elements, and attributes to create more complete and complex forms but I'll reserve that for the PDF I'm making for you plus a cheatsheet! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading the post, that's all for today! and remember to always be the best version of you! 🤩&lt;/p&gt;
