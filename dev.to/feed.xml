      <title>8 Great Plugins ‚öôÔ∏è for Web Developers üßë‚Äçüíª</title>
      <author>Roden</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 16:44:55 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/kerthin/8-great-plugins-for-web-developers-3701</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/kerthin/8-great-plugins-for-web-developers-3701</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I would like to talk about browser plugins that help make the life of a web developer easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I decided to give an example of 8 plugins that I often use while working or if I surf in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let's get started&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorzilla/bhlhnicpbhignbdhedgjhgdocnmhomnp"&gt;ColorZilla&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With ColorZilla you can get a color reading from any point in your browser, quickly adjust this color and paste it into another program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a great plugin that will help you &lt;code&gt;determine the code of any color on any pixel that you have pointed at with a special pipette&lt;/code&gt;. This works with both websites and images. If you can't point the eyedropper at the image, because the image begins to disappear, then open the image in a separate window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a)&lt;/strong&gt; Click &lt;code&gt;Pick Color From Page&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dRwtPKSk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qeh3q558pbhojnow3567.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dRwtPKSk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qeh3q558pbhojnow3567.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;b)&lt;/strong&gt; We point the &lt;code&gt;pipette&lt;/code&gt; at the &lt;code&gt;desired area&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;click&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--z1WI7va_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qhamkwks8dn690nekz3e.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--z1WI7va_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qhamkwks8dn690nekz3e.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;c)&lt;/strong&gt; Open the &lt;code&gt;Color Picker&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9LUMR0Qh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3lt72dybh95vqv1nunb8.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9LUMR0Qh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3lt72dybh95vqv1nunb8.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi?hl=en"&gt;PerfectPixel&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PerfectPixel allows developers and markup designers put a semi-transparent image overlay over the top of the developed HTML and perform pixel perfect comparison between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_9jNvIaR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/46386j3kiqf9iefaht44.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_9jNvIaR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/46386j3kiqf9iefaht44.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/window-resizer/kkelicaakdanhinjdeammmilcgefonfh?hl=en"&gt;Window Resizer&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This extension re-sizes the browser's window in order to emulate various resolutions. It is particularly useful for web designers and developers by helping them test their layouts on different browser resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RsJ1oE8L--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xvzdgfcg9e8pu3q1d309.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RsJ1oE8L--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xvzdgfcg9e8pu3q1d309.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wappalyzer/gppongmhjkpfnbhagpmjfkannfbllamg?hl=en"&gt;Wappalyzer&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wappalyzer is a browser extension that uncovers the technologies used on websites. It detects content management systems, eCommerce platforms, web servers, JavaScript frameworks, analytics tools and many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--n-vNuAQT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c8m9zk69ss7jyyr003z1.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--n-vNuAQT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c8m9zk69ss7jyyr003z1.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/take-webpage-screenshots/mcbpblocgmgfnpjjppndjkmgjaogfceg?hl=en"&gt;FireShot&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take FULL webpage screenshots. Capture, edit and save them to &lt;code&gt;PDF/JPEG/GIF/PNG&lt;/code&gt;, upload, print, send to OneNote, clipboard or email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WspUwwIG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c7r6dlc7hq2yzgt1qd35.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WspUwwIG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c7r6dlc7hq2yzgt1qd35.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pinterest-save-button/gpdjojdkbbmdfjfahjcgigfpmkopogic?hl=en"&gt;Pinterest Save Button&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save your favorite ideas online so you can easily get back to them later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this plugin, you can add any images you like from any to yours collections to your &lt;code&gt;Pinterest account&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you hover over the image, you will see a red button in the upper right corner with which you can select the Pinterest collection to which you want to save the image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a)&lt;/strong&gt; Choosing the image&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--C-Qq5bIK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/y2ybfbdj97i3fbvd94pz.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--C-Qq5bIK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/y2ybfbdj97i3fbvd94pz.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;b)&lt;/strong&gt; Save&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3_-ilLAM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i4cjuseoxefz13azof7h.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3_-ilLAM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i4cjuseoxefz13azof7h.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd?hl=en"&gt;Vue.js devtools&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrome and Firefox DevTools extension for debugging Vue.js applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An amazing plugin that simplifies your work in the browser. Allows you to see your &lt;code&gt;component tree&lt;/code&gt;, as well as the &lt;code&gt;data of the components&lt;/code&gt; themselves. I believe that this plugin is necessary for any Vue developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Utjtvu2j--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ppzv5pulvxe2bo79hnoa.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Utjtvu2j--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ppzv5pulvxe2bo79hnoa.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;8. &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=en"&gt;JSON Formatter&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very convenient plugin that makes JSON files more readable, and also makes &lt;code&gt;links clickable&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--75HQ6xNT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lkhr3fuuix8vckq5x2xr.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--75HQ6xNT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lkhr3fuuix8vckq5x2xr.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The End&lt;/h1&gt;

      <title>Introduction to ‚ÄäREST¬†API</title>
      <author>Pratham üë®‚Äçüíª‚ú®</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 16:16:26 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/rapidapi/introduction-to-rest-api-1a9h</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/rapidapi/introduction-to-rest-api-1a9h</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The abbreviation REST stands for &lt;strong&gt;"REpresentational State Transfer"&lt;/strong&gt;.¬†   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REST APIs are used to call resources and allow the software to communicate based on standardized principles, properties, and constraints.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-rest-apis-work"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How REST APIs work
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REST APIs operate on a simple request/response system. You can send a request using these HTTP methods:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GET&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;POST&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PUT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PATCH&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DELETE¬†&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REST APIs can include endpoints, headers, URL parameters, and the request body. The endpoints perform a specific action on the URL, take some optional parameters and might return the data. Think of it like an automated answering machine that asks you to press 1 for service, press 2 for another service, 3 for yet another service, and so on. When you send a request to an endpoint, it responds with the relevant data, which is generally formatted as JSON, XML, plain text, images, HTML, and more.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REST APIs can also be designed with many different endpoints that return different types of data. Accessing multiple REST API endpoints require multiple API calls.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A true RESTful API will also conform to the REST architectural constraints outlined by Fielding's dissertation, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Client-Server Architecture&lt;br&gt;
The client and server are decoupled to improve scalability and allow the components to evolve independently.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statelessness&lt;br&gt;
Statelessness means that every HTTP request happens in complete isolation. Each request contains the information necessary to service the request. The server never relies on information from previous requests. There's no state.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cacheability&lt;br&gt;
Responses can be explicitly or implicitly defined as cacheable or non-cacheable to improve scalability and performance. For example, enabling the cache of GET requests can improve the response times of requests for resource data.     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Layering&lt;br&gt;
Different layers of the API architecture should work together, creating a scalable system that is easy to update or adjust.     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uniform Interface&lt;br&gt;
Communication between the client and the server must be done in a standardized language that is independent of both. This improves scalability and flexibility.     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#when-to-use-rest%C2%A0apis"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  When to Use REST¬†APIs
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the constraints of the REST architectural style, REST APIs are a good fit for projects that need to be&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scalable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REST APIs are particularly well-suited for web applications. In addition, if you are looking for the following characteristics, REST is a strong option:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Familiarity&lt;br&gt;
Most people in your engineering team have already interacted with ‚Ääa REST API. This type of API, being the most common, has the shortest learning curve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interoperability&lt;br&gt;
Due to the popularity of REST, many platforms and frameworks have a built-in library capable of interfacing with a REST API that has wide support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Development efficiency&lt;br&gt;
REST APIs are reusable, enabling developers to easily create independent microservices that work independently of one another as they are decoupled from clients and accessible by multiple applications.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REST APIs have become the most popular type of API due to their flexible and fast performance. We anticipate REST APIs will continue to be a popular choice for years to come. With that being said, this is pretty much it for this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Head over to &lt;a href="https://RapidAPI.com?utm_source=dev.to/rapidapi&amp;amp;utm_medium=DevRel&amp;amp;utm_campaign=DevRel"&gt;RapidAPI Hub&lt;/a&gt; and explore tens of thousands of REST APIs you can use with a single API Key.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Best Practices Are The Best For Whom?</title>
      <author>Kevin Murphy</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 16:01:18 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/kevin_j_m/best-practices-are-the-best-for-whom-5hm8</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/kevin_j_m/best-practices-are-the-best-for-whom-5hm8</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a great time talking to Andrew Mason, Jason Charnes , and Chris Oliver on Remote Ruby. The episode was just released, and you can listen to it &lt;a href="https://remoteruby.transistor.fm/143"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's something bothering me that I feel I didn't say all that clearly. I mention that these rules (test coverage, DRY, and performant code are the examples given in the conversation) feel easy, but are hard to apply in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who am I saying they're easy for? You may think I'm talking about the people who we ask to use them. And that may be true - it may be easy, or easier, to follow the rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, that's not what gets me worked up about this. Instead, I think it's easy or easier for the people who &lt;strong&gt;say&lt;/strong&gt; the rule, and does a disservice to those who we ask to apply it, unless it's backed up with a lot more support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#testing-for-coverage"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Testing for coverage
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thoughts here apply in a lot of scenarios, but let's use a tangible example. I'll choose test coverage because we spend a lot of the episode talking about it, and metrics in general, and I think it's pretty illustrative for what I want to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like writing tests. They give me fast feedback. They allow me to validate my architecture and design. They give me confidence to make future changes. I'm bought in. Writing tests is part of my workflow. Having a test coverage bar or metric that we track isn't likely to change the way I write code - at least, not in what I consider a materially valuable way. No, the apps I work with don't have 100% test coverage. My goal is to have sufficient coverage that I feel confident making a change and documenting current behavior. That's a lot harder to quantify - but if you know how to quantify confidence - let me know!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what about the person who doesn't write tests? Mandating tests will be good for the project, right? People who aren't as familiar with writing tests will do so, and the project will be better off because there are tests now, right? Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#impacts-of-best-practices-as-mandates"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Impacts of best practices as mandates
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The person who isn't familiar with or comfortable writing tests likely still has ways that they get confidence that their code works or validates their assumptions or gets feedback on their progress. A new tester isn't going to start getting that comfort from tests solely because they have to write them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is the team writing tests now? Because a computer will yell at them if they don't, and/or their code won't get merged. It's a box to check. Without the training and backing of why testing is important and valuable, and giving people the space to learn, grow, and experiment - they can resent it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What good are the tests you have then? They made your metric look good, but what are you going to use them for? It's unclear, beyond demonstrating that they exist and giving your CI provider more money if you're billed by minute usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are these tests going to help you catch a bug before it gets into production, or fix one that's already there? Did these tests help inform the choices developers made while writing the code that accompanies the test? Did these tests allow for immediate, small steps with fast feedback?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know - and neither do you probably. Those things are hard to measure. They're also a lot of the value people believe they get out of testing. Capturing or enforcing test coverage metrics in a vacuum does nothing to help inform how much better off you are than if you had no tests at all. It's a proxy measure that's difficult to draw conclusions from without digging deeper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-bother-following-the-rules"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why bother following the rules?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn't mean don't write tests. It can give you insights you didn't have before! Chris Oliver talked about the pay gem, and how different vendors may support features differently, or not at all. Testing can reveal that to you in a quicker/safer way than other explorations. Not only because a test may fail - but because the work Chris does, and things he researched, in order to have that test fail, gives more information about how the vendor's feature works. If you want to know more about that, I have another talk about testing (and designing interactions with) third-party dependencies &lt;a href="https://kevinjmurphy.com/posts/railsconf-2020/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm on "team testing". My process of getting there came from a lot of opportunities to learn from testing, experiencing it, and having the chance to be "saved" by them. Forcing tests may increase the likelihood those things happen, but I think you'll have a harder time convincing people on the value of tests if they exist to appease a number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A test you wish you'd written may have more impact on your career than one you wrote perfectly. The experience of not having that safety net, of not having that immediate feedback, and coming to terms with the consequences of that over the life of a project will stick with you. That doesn't mean don't write tests. But recognize it might not click for someone until they &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; this concept exists, they &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; they didn't use it, and now they &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; how much worse off they are right now without it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn't mean don't track test coverage. It can be motivating! Jason Charnes mentioned using it to drive an increase in coverage on a project. Once he got the value he sought out of the tests, the metric/number itself didn't matter as much, so he moved on. Jason got the benefit he wanted, and the metric may have helped drive him there, but I'm betting that the benefit wasn't seeing a bigger number on his test coverage %.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#put-in-the-work"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Put in the work
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's easy to say these rules and walk away feeling like we've shared some wisdom. What's harder is putting in the work to help a person grow so they happen upon their own wisdom. We need to have support structures in place so people can learn about these things, and wrestle with them, and gain familiarity. Then they're not rules to be followed - they become shared values we benefit from, and they're used when we see a benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks Andrew, Jason, and Chris for having me on.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Brain Time vs. Butt Time: Improve Developer Productivity </title>
      <author>Nick Hodges</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 15:57:13 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/linearb/brain-time-vs-butt-time-improve-developer-productivity-4468</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/linearb/brain-time-vs-butt-time-improve-developer-productivity-4468</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many moons ago, I tweeted the following about how to improve developer productivity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XzsD1Dvu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7wzr4k3f95ta3ncs19mm.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XzsD1Dvu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7wzr4k3f95ta3ncs19mm.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tracking-time"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tracking Time
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a pretty big controversy in the software development community about logging time. Of course, if you are billable, you need to log your time, but what if you aren‚Äôt? Should you have to keep track of the time you spend writing code? Does tracking time do anything to improve &lt;a href="https://linearb.io/blog/engineering-productivity/"&gt;developer productivity&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I know that no one really likes to track their time. It‚Äôs a pain. It‚Äôs challenging to be accurate. It‚Äôs hard to get time properly categorized. But it can be invaluable for making those important business decisions. I‚Äôm not going to solve that argument here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is a bigger problem with measuring time. The only thing you can really measure is ‚ÄúButt Time‚Äù. Butt Time is the actual amount of time someone has their butt in a chair while working on a project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need Butt Time to get any work done, of course. But managers should not be insisting on a lot of Butt Time. Butt Time isn‚Äôt really what you want to maximize. What you really want to foster is Brain Time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-do-you-really-want-to-measure"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What Do You Really Want to Measure?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Butt Time isn‚Äôt at all equivalent to productive development time. Butt Time includes reading email, answering questions and generally handling any number of interruptions, daydreaming, personal calls, meetings, and other distractions. And those distractions, however minor, break a developer‚Äôs concentration. It is also time spent not working on the task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0AkPwcYZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xyksmcxc3q66ic9vo9es.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0AkPwcYZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xyksmcxc3q66ic9vo9es.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you get right down to it, development is all about concentration ‚Äî Brain Time. With a coding project of any size at all, doing development requires complete focus and attention. You need to build up complex data structures and patterns in your mind in order to really be productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing this takes time ‚Äî I‚Äôve heard it described as building a house of cards in your mind. Building that house of cards can take upwards of fifteen minutes depending upon the project. But here‚Äôs the bummer: It only takes a second for that house of cards to come tumbling down. One distraction can make your fifteen minute investment disappear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-zone"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Zone
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, time spent in ‚ÄúThe Zone‚Äù ‚Äî with that house of cards constructed and true, highly productive work getting done ‚Äî is what we all are seeking. We‚Äôve all probably had that awesome experience of getting into that zone for hours at a time and wondering where the time went. We know how cool that is ‚Äî and how precious. That‚Äôs what we want to measure ‚Äî Brain Time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that‚Äôs a really hard ‚Äî if not impossible ‚Äî thing to do. Getting accurate, meaningful Butt Time measurements is difficult enough. But how in the world can you actually measure Brain Time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll argue that you really can‚Äôt. In the end, Butt Time is only a poor proxy for Brain Time. And all too often, managers will use Butt Time as a measure of productivity. What we need to do is to try to increase the Butt Time to Brain Time ratio by providing an environment where Brain Time is maximized as a percentage of total Butt Time. It‚Äôs critical to improve developer productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-can-you-do-to-improve-developer-productivity"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What Can You Do to Improve Developer Productivity?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are ways to do that ‚Äî ensuring that your developers have an office with a door that they can close is an important first step. The book &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Peopleware-Productive-Projects-Teams-3rd/dp/0321934113/"&gt;Peopleware &lt;/a&gt;is really the Bible for this, and &lt;a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2016/just-shut-let-devs-concentrate-programming-expert-advises/"&gt;Joel Spolsky has talked a lot about it as well&lt;/a&gt;. Uninterrupted quiet time is the key. Leaving developers alone is critical to maximizing Brain Time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hvu0K0xi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sgfxm86znlbpxbtu66g3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hvu0K0xi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sgfxm86znlbpxbtu66g3.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers inherently know that ‚ÄúButt Time‚Äù isn‚Äôt really important. They know that time spent thinking is way more valuable. I‚Äôve known developers that do some of their best thinking while wandering the halls, allegedly ‚Äúdoing nothing‚Äù (Heaven forbid that a developer isn‚Äôt sitting in their chair!), or making a cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managers should make sure that they aren‚Äôt expecting developers to be sitting and typing all the time. Sometimes great work gets done while simply staring at the screen doing nothing. Sometimes walking the dog brings about an epiphany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join in on the discussion about all things Software Development on the &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/tpkmwM6c3g"&gt;Dev Interrupted Discord Server&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managers should recognize this and encourage their team to do what they need to do to do their best thinking. If a developer can concentrate at night from 10:00pm to 3:00am, then she should be encouraged to work then. Every developer is different, and a good manager will learn what works for their team members and provide for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing we need to do is to respect ‚Äî indeed, celebrate ‚Äî those developers that are quiet and don‚Äôt say much. Many developers are introverts that don‚Äôt say much at all. They come to work, write great code, and go home. But sadly, we don‚Äôt always respect this. Being quiet is a very valuable virtue in a software developer ‚Äî both because they themselves are being productive and they aren‚Äôt breaking other‚Äôs concentration. We should give honor and respect to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Butt Time is easy to come by and fairly easy to measure. Brain Time, however, is a precious and hard to measure commodity that needs to be nurtured and respected. If you really want to improve developer productivity, optimize for Brain Time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is Remote Work better than In-Office for Developers? </title>
      <author>Conor Bronsdon</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 15:56:09 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/linearb/is-remote-work-better-than-in-office-for-developers-43ha</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/linearb/is-remote-work-better-than-in-office-for-developers-43ha</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was written exclusively for the Dev Interrupted by Krzysztof Waraksa, an active and participating member of the Dev Interrupted Discord.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
In the past year-and-a-half, going remote has been the primary goal and focus for many companies and individuals. The beginning of the remote work overhaul was rocky to say the least but now that all this time has passed and workplaces have figured out how to work with it and not make it an utter mess- Is it worth keeping? Is it better than being in-office? Should remote work be a standard for dev teams, and in-office be secondary?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that depends on a couple of factors. With some feedback from the Dev Interrupted Discord community, let‚Äôs dive into the advantages and disadvantages of remote work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-disadvantages"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Disadvantages
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team bonding is difficult&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not impossible or anything, but I‚Äôve found it‚Äôs so unbelievably easy to bond with a team in person doing regular lunches and such. (‚Ä¶) I miss being able to see someone frustrated or struggling with something and walking over to them with a couple other people and saying ‚Äúlet‚Äôs head to lunch and clear our heads.‚Äù You build bonds very quickly when you do demonstrable human things to reduce someone‚Äôs stress.‚Äù ‚Äî Discord User The Panda#2143&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jumping off from what The Panda said, the first major disadvantage that many people will voice is a lack of genuine team bonding when your team is fully remote. It requires much more active effort to bond with your teammates over Zoom. Being around another person naturally speeds up the bonding process much more than occasionally messaging someone because you need something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When working remote, your team needs to be intentional about team bonding. An excellent way of maintaining some form of social bonding is to have a weekly meeting where you can just sit down and chat with your colleagues, talk about what you did on the weekend, maybe occasionally host a ‚Äúshow and tell‚Äù of your own. Figure out what fun little trinkets your colleagues collect! Another popular weekly meeting idea are &lt;a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-successfully-work-remotely-in-an-engineering-organization/"&gt;‚Äúcoffee talks‚Äù &lt;/a&gt;, which are informal breakout rooms hosted on Zoom that can be hopped into or out of at will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Team leaders also need to be sure to regularly schedule fun events ‚Äî whether in person or online ‚Äî to bond team members. This could be a happy hour where everyone gets shipped a cocktail kit and makes them together, or a digital magic show, an in-person meet up, or something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Xhf7Vvx0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2048/0%2AgX17Zteb10o0bYCe.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Xhf7Vvx0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2048/0%2AgX17Zteb10o0bYCe.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video Call Dread&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, it is just the most inconvenient thing to be forced to have to sit around in a conference call several times a day to get things done. Text is confusing, unclear. But you have to discuss things somehow, so you end up calling. And calling. And calling- is it just me or is it simply exhausting to sit around with the ‚Äúimportant work meeting‚Äù looming overhead in between everything you do? Even many industry leaders and remote work proponents discuss what they often refer to as ‚ÄúZoom fatigue.‚Äù In a recent &lt;a href="https://devinterrupted.com/video/the-new-leaders-of-remote-engineering-panel/"&gt;remote work panel hosted by LinearB &lt;/a&gt;, video call dread was highlighted as a major downside of remote work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúMy kid‚Äôs school over the last year has been trying to keep us involved, and one of the ways they‚Äôve done that is booking these Zoom sessions in the evening. I notice when I get [to the meeting] I just don‚Äôt want to be there. I‚Äôve been on video all day long.‚Äù ‚Äî Lawrence Mandel, Director of Engineering at Shopify&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest appeals of remote work is that you have so much freedom to do things on your own time and create focus time, but it is nearly impossible to feel comfortable doing a different activity for a while when you‚Äôre still in ‚Äúwork mode‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So while in reality you do focused work for 4‚Äì5 hours, mentally you‚Äôre still working the whole 8‚Äì9 hours. The meetings and work you do aren‚Äôt consecutive and are instead the equivalent of a car starting and stopping in a traffic jam. Every hour or two, you have to sit up and move .5 metres before you sit around and do something else again. It gets exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite everything, remote work is still built around the idea of being in an office for nearly half the day. Which really shouldn‚Äôt be a surprise, as remote work was never about changing the working hours, but the expectation often comes with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of printer access.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, Really, this isn‚Äôt the biggest disadvantage but it‚Äôs something that I, as a young man under the age of thirty, found highly amusing. I can guarantee that a majority of people today just don‚Äôt own a printer. And that makes sense, you generally don‚Äôt have to print a lot these days! Though, in many cases, having an on-paper copy of a digital file is reassuring to have. (At least for me, I prefer having paper copies of important documents over a file on my desktop!) If you‚Äôre going to be working remotely, you may have to invest in a printer. Or hope there‚Äôs a copy-shop near you. You really don‚Äôt realize how convenient having a printer at work can be until you‚Äôre forced to work from home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You‚Äôll also likely be forced to learn the true cost of printer ink if you haven‚Äôt already. Oh dear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The commute was a benefit!?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúI miss my commute. It was a 10‚Äì20 minute bike ride depending on the route and the weather. I would do it year round in a winter climate, and I always was very happy about the forced fresh air in the winter. The idea of jumping on a bike in subzero snowy weather seems terrible until you‚Äôre out there, so it made the fresh air and exercise happen.‚Äù ‚Äî Discord User ParksideBrad#9930&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many people, the commute is a huge issue. Especially if you have to drive a car, or take public transport. In cases like those, getting to work remotely and avoiding that mess is great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To some hardy souls like ParksideBrad, the commute was actually a beneficial and nice thing. Either way, losing that two-birds-one-stone manner of exercising and getting to work can be a noticeable hit to your daily schedule. While this can be solved by just exercising on your own time- it‚Äôs harder to have to intentionally build that into your routine. It‚Äôs hard to exercise without reason ( &lt;a href="https://www.verywellfit.com/why-arent-you-motivated-to-exercise-1231389"&gt;‚ÄúGetting healthier‚Äù isn‚Äôt really the best motivator for many, even if it‚Äôs important. &lt;/a&gt;), so using ‚ÄúGoing from point A to point B while exercising‚Äù as a manner of getting that important movement in is a very valid way of keeping yourself healthy mentally and physically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-advantages"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Advantages
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;No commute? Perfect! (Sorry, cyclists!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, so sure, I did just write that the commute could be a benefit for those that like to exercise. But really, for a majority of people it was always a pain. Getting an extra hour to yourself in the morning is a significant bonus as you don‚Äôt feel the need to rush yourself out of bed to avoid any traffic. And getting extra time to yourself just throughout the day? Honestly, the following words by some of our community members emphasize how much better a lack of a commute is for many people:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúWith no commute and no office tying me down, it‚Äôs easy to work from just about anywhere the internet exists. This facilitates living in new places, experiencing new things ‚Äî which is amazing! ‚Äî Discord user NobilityPNW#7631&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúOne big disadvantage of Remote Work: avoiding commute times! I do not miss commuting at all! I save a ton of time that I can use for work or for work/life balance and necessary tasks. I‚Äôm also significantly more flexible.‚Äù ‚Äî Discord User Conor#3700&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More hours in the day are dedicated to &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your 24 hours in the day are not the same as Beyonc√©.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a sentence that often gets thrown around in the following way: &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúYou have the same 24 hours in the day like [insert celebrity or billionaire here]‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;. Sure, you both have 24 hours to do everything in the day. But the allocation of those hours is vastly different. Because unlike Beyonc√©, you can‚Äôt hire people to do your cooking, laundry, cleaning, etc, for you. You don‚Äôt get to leave all the painstakingly long chores and commutes to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But thanks to remote work, a lot of these things get a little less bad. Sure, you‚Äôre still working at home, but you can take breaks. You can control your activity, your time. You decide if you want to go take a brief pause to play a short game with your kids, or if you want to have a coffee with your partner. You get a chance to spend more time with your home social groups, your family, your loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúI was on a call with Dan Lines recently talking about Linear B and my 6 year old came into the room and attacked me with a nerf sword. It was short lived, not terribly disruptive, but it felt good to me knowing he had access when he needed it (I survived unscathed). For most of his life I was gone 60‚Äì80 hours a week or traveling around the country. Since we went fully remote, we are very close and he feels sad if I have to go downtown for the odd meeting once a month. It has changed our family for the better and when I feel a stronger connection to my family and like their needs are being met, I can focus all my excess energy on whatever I want.‚Äù ‚Äî Discord User The Panda#2143&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You finally get a printer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! You have a reason to buy a printer. Hopefully it‚Äôll last you for the next two decades at minimum. May the prices of ink cartridges remain low for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The flexibility of work-locations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WHr674Ja--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2048/0%2A6bXZp3TWbYy464Ye.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WHr674Ja--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2048/0%2A6bXZp3TWbYy464Ye.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being able to work wherever at any point in your workday is an incredible advantage, especially if you struggle to stay focused being in an office environment. Having the chance to get away from the ‚ÄúADHD poison‚Äù that noisy offices often are‚Ä¶ Sitting at a quiet cafe in the park, or working from the couch at home with your beloved cat purring away, it all makes for a much better environment. And then being able to change that on a whim when you decide you‚Äôre no longer comfortable? Even better. &lt;a href="https://devinterrupted.com/adhd-in-the-workplace-3-ways-you-can-help/"&gt;After all, this is the easiest way for a company to support employees that may need a calmer environment to work in.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this isn‚Äôt even just about being comfortable- it also means that if there are any issues you‚Äôre having in your home (such as construction), or your internet is down, you can still stay in touch by being able to connect anywhere else. Rather than having a whole office-outage take out several hours (or potentially, days) of work because something went wrong with the network or power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allowing for remote work makes you disability-friendly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not just for people who are disabled that apply for the job, but also for those that may become disabled during their time working in your teams. Unfortunately, life isn‚Äôt perfect, and a sudden health issue could turn out to heavily impair your wellbeing. Before remote work was standardized, if you could no longer go into work on a daily basis you would most likely end up having to quit your job. But now, maybe you can still work with your disability as long as you‚Äôre at home. Or as long as you can take frequent breaks, which are made far easier in the comfort of your own home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs certainly more advantages to remote work compared to the disadvantages, but this is a case where the disadvantages shouldn‚Äôt be left unaddressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disadvantages often fall into real problems that have some half-solutions. But honestly? The best solution might be to reduce the amount of in-office days, and have an option and support for full remote for those that need it. Most people would be happy to go into the office for just a few days a week while staying remote for the rest. And let‚Äôs not forget that this‚Äôd be the perfect way to allow people to continue wasting printer ink at the office instead of having to invest in their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, you must admit that giving employees agency over their hours tends to leave them happier and with a more positive outlook on their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I'm building a modern spreadsheet</title>
      <author>Stephen Sisk</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 15:40:53 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/stephensisk/i-m-building-a-modern-spreadsheet-2l66</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/stephensisk/i-m-building-a-modern-spreadsheet-2l66</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I like spreadsheets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a programmer, I find the simple UI and immediately propagating updates to be powerful and refreshing. Considering that it was invented &lt;em&gt;over 40 years ago&lt;/em&gt; it's truly an achievement that the core concept is relevant today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I also look at the UI and see something that hasn't changed much from the days of VisiCalc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CMgLxl8I--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://stephensisk.net/images/Untitled.png"&gt;

*VisiCalc, circa 1978*
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--75xYVO_1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://stephensisk.net/images/Untitled%25201.png"&gt;

*Spreadsheet, circa 2021*
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We moved away from neon blue towards grey and discovered non-monospaced fonts! üòâ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What should spreadsheets look like without baggage from the past? Not designed by a human primarily used to working by writing on a chalkboard or paper, but someone from the far future.... 2021!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#spreadsheets-have-not-evolved-to-match-their-impact-on-society"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Spreadsheets have not evolved to match their impact on society
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mistakes caused by spreadsheets have unfortunately grown alongside spreadsheets. It's hard to overstate that, given that the EU has a &lt;a href="http://www.eusprig.org/"&gt;special interest group&lt;/a&gt; devoted to discussing and reducing the risk from spreadsheets, and I think the scope of the problem warrants a look at contributing factors of those errors and ways to reduce them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes I outline below were originally just a way to scratch my itch as a programmer for a spreadsheet tool that combined the simplicity of spreadsheets with the powerful tools I use every day as a software engineer, but I realized that some of the changes I wanted were the result of lessons in avoiding programming errors that the software industry as a whole has had to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must continually ask if the software we use every day for critical tasks can be improved - my assertion that when it comes to spreadsheets, the answer is yes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lets-start-with-equations-and-basic-math"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Let's start with equations and basic math
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's look at a simple spreadsheet equation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;B2-B1&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this mean? Should we have used B3 instead of B2? Should it have been &lt;code&gt;B1-B2&lt;/code&gt; instead? These are unanswerable questions without manually checking the other cells in the spreadsheet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if instead you could write:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;profit=income-expenses&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ü§Ø&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Variable names in a spreadsheet! &lt;em&gt;[1]&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how can we get this magical world where we get to use variables naturally in spreadsheets?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's look at a simple spreadsheet:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZcbdjDD1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://stephensisk.net/images/Untitled%25203.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZcbdjDD1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://stephensisk.net/images/Untitled%25203.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the spreadsheet already has labels we could use for variable names, but the spreadsheet doesn't realize there's a connection, and figuring out there's a connection would be tricky and error prone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, we could think about formalizing it, and let each cell have a label and a value. That makes a lot of sense! However, there's a reason existing spreadsheets haven't done that, and it's called.. &lt;em&gt;the grid&lt;/em&gt;. The grid layout is flexible and makes creating ad hoc tables easy, but anything can go anywhere, which makes it hard to guess what's a label and what's a value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let's talk about a design that lets us bake labels and values in from the start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DPYbEmkg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://stephensisk.net/images/Untitled%25204.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DPYbEmkg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://stephensisk.net/images/Untitled%25204.png" alt="Untitled"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, we still have cells (one label/value pair), and we line them up vertically. Users can create new cells below existing ones. And we can use those labels as variable names. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lends itself more to being a document rather than a traditional grid. We can allow users to type in their labels and values and use &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; as a natural delimiter to separate the two. This usage of  &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; flows naturally from existing spreadsheet formulas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's see it in action!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7gmvIOIr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://stephensisk.net/images/basic_doc.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7gmvIOIr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://stephensisk.net/images/basic_doc.gif" alt="basic_doc.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this design works pretty well. And everything doesn't have to be a single column - a newspaper style layout, with multiple columns would allow for using the full screen just like a regular spreadsheet. Larger items like charts could span multiple columns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For mobile, the layout lends itself well to flowing and adapting to a compressed layout, resulting in something like:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ELHRzZEZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://stephensisk.net/images/Untitled%25205.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ELHRzZEZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://stephensisk.net/images/Untitled%25205.png" alt="Untitled"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a vertical layout incorporating labels and cells gives us the power of variable naming without needing to give up on the nice layout of the grid. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Further thoughts:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can easily autogenerate a name (eg. cell1, A1, etc) if the user doesn't want to enter a label.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Autocomplete with variable names would make this very user friendly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This UI can be made more user friendly by providing a menu/toolbox of items that can be added to the worksheet (calculations/tables/etc) - this means users don't need to memorize a list of commands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn't discuss user defined functions/higher order functions, but they are definitely on the road map.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[1] I hear someone in the back yelling "Spreadsheets do support naming cells!", but... you'll need to go in and manually name the cell a second time - and if the label text changes, the variable name of the cell doesn't change. Also, I'll bet half the folks reading this didn't even realize this functionality existed, and if they do, they don't use it most of the time. I also hear that one other guy waaay in the back yelling that A1 is still a variable name.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#but-what-about-tables"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  But what about tables?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The grid is perfect for tables!" I hear you saying. "It is nothing but a table".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when you want to have columns with uniform calculations it's a bit of a pain to copy the formula into each one, and of course who doesn't love formatting a spreadsheet table for the umpteenth time? &lt;em&gt;[2]&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's take a look at what a calculation table could look like in our new worksheet format:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xWUsOi2V--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://stephensisk.net/images/Untitled%25206.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xWUsOi2V--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://stephensisk.net/images/Untitled%25206.png" alt="Untitled"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a design sketch and it needs more work. But the core idea is that you simply state that you want a table by entering &lt;code&gt;TABLE&lt;/code&gt; and it pops up a simple table creator. The first and second rows define the initial value and formula for the column. You can see the usage of the &lt;code&gt;prev&lt;/code&gt; keyword to get values from the previous row.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll note that since the app knows it's a table, it's able to nicely format the table header and properly align the contents without any actions by the user. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that once the app knows it's a calculated table, you don't need to show the entire table - the user can expand it to see more or less of the table as they see fit, and the document will naturally flow around it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[2] Yup, I'm aware Excel has formal table support - I bet even fewer folks know about it and use it regularly than named cells. And google sheets support &lt;a href="https://www.benlcollins.com/spreadsheets/how-to-make-a-table-in-google-sheets/"&gt;is&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://hooshmand.net/tables-in-google-sheets/"&gt;abysmal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#data-tables-amp-manipulation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Data Tables &amp;amp; Manipulation
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;or: I just want to use SQL instead of trying to figure out what "values" in a pivot table means&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last section ignored a bog way we use spreadsheet tables: user entered data tables (eg. "spreadsheet as a makeshift database"). I think it'd easy to create that: it'd be as easy as detecting that the user doesn't add a formula as the contents of the cell on the second row. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have data tables, how are you going to process that data? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I'm coding, I love using functions like Map/Reduce/Filter to manipulate and produce new tables of data (those are equivalent to SQL's SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, etc.. if you're more familiar with those), and I'd love to have that functionality available in spreadsheets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another place where the grid becomes problematic. All of those functions output &lt;em&gt;another table&lt;/em&gt;, and you need to put that output table somewhere. Thus, they force you to make a compromise on how to display your output. Are you going to stick it all inside one cell where you can't see it? "Spill" the table out across multiple cells? Hope you don't have any data around the cell doing the calculation that get overwritten! (or overwritten later if the size of the output changes). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where our new layout really shines. We can just have one cell per operation and output a new table each time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Further thoughts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also don't have to keep user entered data and calculations in separate tables - you can just do it on a column by column basis (some columns in a table can define a calculation, others can contain user entered data).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having an easy way to add CSV files, other sources of data from the web, and other worksheets sure seems useful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#units"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Units
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm just going to show an example worksheet here, because I think it's pretty self-explanatory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TYd12fT8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://stephensisk.net/images/Untitled%25207.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TYd12fT8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://stephensisk.net/images/Untitled%25207.png" alt="Untitled"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now the app understands that&lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; is a unit that should be carried through to other values - we didn't have to special that total_income was a dollar, it just inherited that unit from the values it read fro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The _ symbol is ignored in numbers and is useful for making numbers more readable without interfering with function calls*[3].* &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rGSxKOm9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://stephensisk.net/images/Untitled%25208.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rGSxKOm9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://stephensisk.net/images/Untitled%25208.png" alt="Untitled"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... and now that we know it's currency, we can do smart things with the decimals. The "correct" result for &lt;code&gt;7/2&lt;/code&gt; is 3.5, but we know to format it with 2 decimal places because it's currency. We didn't need to change any formatting settings - it just knows to display with 2 decimal places for currency if there's any at all.  You will also note that above in the other_cost_two example, we didn't need to tell it not to display the cents, it could pick up from context that we didn't need to display decimals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Mf03REyo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://stephensisk.net/images/Untitled%25209.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Mf03REyo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://stephensisk.net/images/Untitled%25209.png" alt="Untitled"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Percents work with their own special rules, knowing that the $ unit should carry through to take_home_income, and that 15% is actually .0015 when multiplying.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OP0Wu7YD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://stephensisk.net/images/Untitled%252010.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OP0Wu7YD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://stephensisk.net/images/Untitled%252010.png" alt="Untitled"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... and we can support other types of units, like distances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NtxsrAFN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://stephensisk.net/images/Untitled%252011.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NtxsrAFN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://stephensisk.net/images/Untitled%252011.png" alt="Untitled"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You didn't think I'd forget SI symbols, did you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think adding units to spreadsheets is exciting, if only for the reason that it reduces the amount of formatting that needs to be manually done by the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[3] Function calls + using comma separators in numbers results in chaos. What numbers are being passed to this function? &lt;code&gt;max(100,000, 2, 000)&lt;/code&gt; ? You can interpret that by using spaces, but it's a bit iffy. Using the _ symbol as a separator is a convention becoming popular in programming languages for solving this problem. _ is also culture agnostic, so europeans (number format: 2.000,00) and americans (number format: 2,000.00) can finally get along.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#scenarios"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Scenarios
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I like using spreadsheets for all kinds of calculations, my personal biggest use case is for investment/retirement planning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in that world, being able to explore different scenarios is pretty important. So let's see how we can explore scenarios with worksheets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's an example of a plain old savings worksheet in action:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tDH60POp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://stephensisk.net/images/Untitled%252012.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tDH60POp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://stephensisk.net/images/Untitled%252012.png" alt="Untitled"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;savings_at_retirement&lt;/code&gt; uses a notation I'm not in love with: &lt;code&gt;tableName.column[row]&lt;/code&gt;, but I think this communicates the idea pretty clearly: You can read individual cell values out of a table. (I'll probably move to &lt;code&gt;tableName[column][row]&lt;/code&gt; since that seems much cleaner)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if we wanted to experiment with various savings plans, we could manually change the savings_rate, income, stock_rate_of_return, etc... But why not allow for easy scenario exploration with multiple values?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This UI is definitely a work in progress.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Tciuqq9z--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://stephensisk.net/images/Untitled%252013.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Tciuqq9z--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://stephensisk.net/images/Untitled%252013.png" alt="Untitled"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we introduce the &lt;code&gt;VARY&lt;/code&gt; keyword in &lt;code&gt;stock_rate_of_return&lt;/code&gt;, which allows that variable to have multiple values and causes any values downstream of it to produce multiple outputs, one for each of the values. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introducing the VARY had two downstream effects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Next/Prev controls on &lt;code&gt;savings_over_time&lt;/code&gt; allow you to switch through the various values of &lt;code&gt;stock_rate_of_return&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can also see that there's a nice roll up in &lt;code&gt;savings_at_retirement&lt;/code&gt; showing the end result of savings for each of the values of &lt;code&gt;stock_rate_of_return&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why are we restricting ourselves to one variable at a time? Here I show 3 different VARYs working at once:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xTIE7Z6i--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://stephensisk.net/images/Untitled%252014.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xTIE7Z6i--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://stephensisk.net/images/Untitled%252014.png" alt="Untitled"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll note that both &lt;code&gt;savings_over_time&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;savings_over_retirement&lt;/code&gt; are updated to show the new values of the &lt;code&gt;VARY&lt;/code&gt;s&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...and of course if you change the values of VARY, everything will instantly update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is a very natural but powerful way to express different scenarios, and a simple tool for explore those scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/ammyy9908/create-a-spotify-clone-with-song-playing-feature-1913</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post i describe you how i build a spotify clone using ReactJS,Redux and Spotify Web &amp;amp; Playback API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note:Only for Spotify Premium Users.and This is currently in development but you can view current build online by going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://spotify-clone-steel-alpha.vercel.app"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Features&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User can view his/her profile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User can play track,album,playlist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User can control active device volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User can perform play,pause,next,previous song.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User can create playlist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bugs currently have&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There some glitch in play and pause button when we play a song directly inside app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may encountered some problem in login to app due to spotify access_token stored in cookie basically this is happen because spotify provide an expiration time of access_token of 1 hour so after one hour that token expire but not deleted from cookies so to fix this you have to delete manually from the cookies if you are in Chrome You can visit dev option&amp;gt;application&amp;gt;cookies&amp;gt;url of website and here you find SPOTIFY_TOKEN just remove or delete and refresh the web page then try to login now this issue fixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry but i cannot explain the whole project in this post but you can ping me on &lt;a href="'https://www.linkedin.com/in/sumit-kumar-097a3a204/'"&gt;linkedin&lt;/a&gt; or directly on Dev community by sending a message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#demo-video"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Demo Video
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sorry you may found some noise in demo video.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to combine Rails's Ajax support and Stimulus</title>
      <author>rhymes</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 15:03:18 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/devteam/how-to-combine-rails-s-ajax-support-and-stimulus-3729</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/devteam/how-to-combine-rails-s-ajax-support-and-stimulus-3729</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post I'm going to explain how we are exploring adding snappier SPA-like interactivity to the Admin and what we've learned so far. I am using the word "exploring" because this is ongoing work, that is not visible yet in Forems, so it many or may not reflect the final version but I think there are useful lessons to be learned nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm going to assume you're familiar with &lt;a href="https://rubyonrails.org/"&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/"&gt;Stimulus&lt;/a&gt; and the concept of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component-based_software_engineering"&gt;componentization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-we-wanted-to-accomplish"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What we wanted to accomplish
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start with a video demo:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The goal here is to give the user a perception of interactivity, and we want to do that without unleashing a full client side single page application. Forem's Admin interface is mostly server rendered and we wanted to explore a path to progressively enhance the experience, stopping short of a rewrite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#whats-the-status-of-the-current-admin"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What's the status of the current Admin?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently the Admin, on the backend, is a custom made collection of Rails controllers, for all intents and purposes a part of the Forem core app. It's not an external web app, it's also not generated by a third party gem. We think the Forem Creator (and their merry band of collaborators) experience is paramount and it has evolved from DEV's needs to now the larger Forem ecosystem's.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a custom app, grown over the years, it's admittedly a mix of technologies that we're trying to streamline, hence the need for some good old exploratory software development. On the frontend it currently uses: jQuery, Bootstrap, vanilla JS, Stimulus, Preact, a few web components and our custom &lt;a href="https://storybook.forem.com/"&gt;Crayons design language&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-did-we-explore-an-alternative"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why did we explore an alternative?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end goal is to reduce that to Crayons, Stimulus and use Preact or Web Components when absolutely needed, to foster a nimbler architecture, with reuse between the "frontoffice" website and the admin, where possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After discussing this with the team I set out to investigate the following assumption (not a direct quote): &lt;em&gt;"We want users actions to be interactive, minimizing page reloads, and because of that we're going to send blocks of server rendered HTML to them by injecting the markup into the page".&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this sounds like a barebones version of notable frameworks like Elixir's &lt;a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html"&gt;Phoenix LiveView&lt;/a&gt;, Rails's &lt;a href="https://github.com/stimulusreflex/stimulus_reflex"&gt;StimulusReflex&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://turbo.hotwired.dev/"&gt;Hotwire Turbo&lt;/a&gt;, PHP's &lt;a href="https://laravel-livewire.com/"&gt;LiveWire&lt;/a&gt;, Django's &lt;a href="https://github.com/edelvalle/reactor"&gt;Reactor&lt;/a&gt;... well, you're right! (Bonus: my colleague &lt;a class="mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/jgaskins"&gt;@jgaskins&lt;/a&gt;
 built a &lt;a href="https://github.com/jgaskins/live_view"&gt;LiveView clone for Crystal&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can sense a pattern in these frameworks, and the demand they fulfill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our case, though, we used none of them. I wanted to explore how far we could go without adding a whole framework and by using the tools we had a bit more in depth. This to lessen the cognitive load on anyone that's going to further this exploration or adopt this pattern for the Admin as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the obvious "why should I need a framework to send basic HTML to the client", we have plenty of frameworks and libraries on the client side already and frameworks usually take quite a while to be learned. Also, we're a small team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So &lt;strong&gt;this is how I implented it&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rails and HTML on the server side with a bit of JSON when needed. I cheated a bit the constraints I set for myself using GitHub's &lt;a href="https://viewcomponent.org/"&gt;ViewComponent&lt;/a&gt; but you can achieve similar results using builtin Rails partials and this post isn't going into depth about ViewComponent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rails's &lt;a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/working_with_javascript_in_rails.html"&gt;UJS&lt;/a&gt; (Unobtrusive JavaScript) and &lt;a href="https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/"&gt;Stimulus&lt;/a&gt; on the client side. UJS is a library builtin inside Rails that powers JavaScript interactions on the DOM via Rails special helpers, like &lt;code&gt;link_to&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;button_to&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-does-it-all-fit-together"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How does it all fit together?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start from the goal again: &lt;em&gt;a user clicks on a link, the client side sends a request to the server, some action is performed, some HTML is sent back, this HTML is injected in the page&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what happens when the user clicks on one of the gray boxes for example:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Clicking on "Emails", hits the &lt;code&gt;EmailsController&lt;/code&gt; which renders the &lt;code&gt;EmailsComponent&lt;/code&gt; (which, again, could just be a partial), the resulting HTML is sent to Stimulus which calls a JavaScript function injecting the HTML, thus finalizing the switch of the section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's look at the code, one step at a time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#initiating-the-contact-between-client-and-server"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Initiating the contact between client and server
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how the gray box titled "Emails" is defined in Rails:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight erb"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;link_to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;admin_user_tools_emails_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vi"&gt;@user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;remote: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kp"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                                                 &lt;span class="ss"&gt;data: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;action: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"ajax:success-&amp;gt;user#replacePartial"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
                                                 &lt;span class="ss"&gt;class: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"crayons-card box js-action"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"crayons-subtitle-3 mb-4"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Emails&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"color-base-70"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pluralize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vi"&gt;@emails&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;total&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"past email"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="vi"&gt;@emails&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;verified&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; - Verified&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;-%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;and this is an example of the resulting HTML:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"crayons-card box js-action"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/admin/users/13/tools/emails"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;data-remote=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"true"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;data-action=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"ajax:success-&amp;gt;user#replacePartial"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"crayons-subtitle-3 mb-4"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Emails&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"color-base-70"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; 7 past emails &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There's a bit going on in such a small snippet of code, let's unpack:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;href="/admin/users/13/tools/emails"&lt;/code&gt; identifies this as a regular HTML link, if I were to visit it with my browser I would get the same response JavaScript is going to be sent when the user activates the click.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;data-remote="true"&lt;/code&gt; (the result of &lt;code&gt;remote: true&lt;/code&gt; in Ruby) is how Rails determines if the link should be handled by Ajax or not. Rails calles these &lt;a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/working_with_javascript_in_rails.html#remote-elements"&gt;remote elements&lt;/a&gt;, they can be links, forms or buttons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;data-action="ajax:success-&amp;gt;user#replacePartial"&lt;/code&gt; is how we connect Rails UJS&lt;br&gt;
and Stimulus together. &lt;code&gt;data-action&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;a href="https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/reference/actions"&gt;Stimulus action&lt;/a&gt; (the description of how to handle an event), &lt;code&gt;ajax:success&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/working_with_javascript_in_rails.html#rails-ujs-event-handlers"&gt;custom event triggered by Rails UJS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what it all translates to: &lt;em&gt;on initiating the click on link, let Rails UJS fetch the response via Ajax and, upon a successful response, handle the &lt;code&gt;ajax:success&lt;/code&gt; event via the method &lt;code&gt;replacePartial&lt;/code&gt; in the Stimulus &lt;code&gt;UserController&lt;/code&gt; class&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a lot of behavior in a few lines. It reads like declarative programming with a good abstraction, working well if one wants to minimize the amount of custom JavaScript to write and thus needs to describe behavior directly in the templates :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resource the link points to is a regular HTML snippet, this is what one sees if visited manually:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The great thing (in my opinion), is that the whole behavior in question still works in isolation: it's server side rendered, it redirects upon submission as it should by default, it is essentially a regular HTML form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being able to play with these components in isolation definitely speeds up development&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole section (which I called &lt;code&gt;ToolsComponent&lt;/code&gt; on the server) works&lt;br&gt;
in isolation:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-happens-on-the-server-when-this-request-is-sent"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What happens on the server when this request is sent?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, let's start from the code:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;Admin&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;Users&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;Tools&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;EmailsController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;Admin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;ApplicationController&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;layout&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kp"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;show&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:user_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;

          &lt;span class="n"&gt;render&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;EmailsComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;user: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;content_type: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"text/html"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That's it. We tell Rails not to embed the component (or partial) in a layout, we load the user object and we tell the framework to render the HTML sending it back to the client as HTML (this last tiny detail is important, as Rails's "remote mode" defaults to &lt;code&gt;text/javascript&lt;/code&gt; for the response, which is not very helpful to us in this case...).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-does-the-frontend-do-when-it-receives-the-html"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What does the frontend do when it receives the HTML?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's look at the code once again:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"crayons-card box js-action"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/admin/users/13/tools/emails"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;data-remote=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"true"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;data-action=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"ajax:success-&amp;gt;user#replacePartial"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"crayons-subtitle-3 mb-4"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Emails&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"color-base-70"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; 7 past emails &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We've instructed the app to trigger &lt;code&gt;replacePartial&lt;/code&gt; inside the Stimulus&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;UserController&lt;/code&gt;, this is what it does:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;replacePartial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;preventDefault&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stopPropagation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;xhr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;detail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;classList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;contains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;js-action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toolsComponentTarget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;classList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;hidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;replaceTarget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerHTML&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;xhr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;responseText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;announceChangedSectionToScreenReader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This method:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prevents the default behavior and stops propagation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extracts the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest"&gt;XMLHttpRequest&lt;/a&gt; injected by Rails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hides the section we're looking at and shows the new one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;announces the change to the screen reader, as we are neither changing the URL nor doing a full page reload.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-did-we-make-this-accessible"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How did we make this accessible?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After discussing it with our resident accessibility guru, @suzanne, she suggested we use a "screen reader only" &lt;code&gt;aria-live&lt;/code&gt; element:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"screen-reader-only"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;data-user-target=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"activeSection"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;aria-live=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"polite"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is managed by Stimulus, which at the end of the action, fetches the title of the new section, announces it to the screen reader and changes the focus so the section is ready to be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#recap-so-far"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Recap so far
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far we've seen quite a few things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using Rails builtin capabilities to connect client side code and the server side via Ajax but using server side HTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using Stimulus to listen in on the action and augment behavior as we see fit, keeping the code organized&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;replacing a section of HTML with another, that's self contained in a component
that can be at least functional without JavaScript as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-send-an-email-with-rails-and-stimulus"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to send an email with Rails and Stimulus
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we're going to show how this "connection" works, using sending an email as an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start from the perspective of the user:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-does-the-email-form-do"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What does the email form do?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given we're in the domain of UJS and Stimulus combined, we have to look at how they are connected:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight erb"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;section&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;data-controller=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"users--tools--ajax"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;data-action=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"ajax:success@document-&amp;gt;users--tools--ajax#success ajax:error@document-&amp;gt;users--tools--ajax#error"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- ... --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;form_with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;url: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;send_email_admin_user_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vi"&gt;@user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- ... --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;-%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our "Emails" section declares it needs a Stimulus controller named &lt;code&gt;AjaxController&lt;/code&gt; and that it's going to dispatch to it the Rails UJS events &lt;code&gt;ajax:success&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ajax:error&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the "Send Email" submit button is activated, Rails will send the form via Ajax to the server, which upon successful submission, will answer with data, in this case JSON.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-happens-on-the-server"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What happens on the server?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, code first:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# email sent&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;respond_to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Email sent!"&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;html&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;flash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;redirect_back&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;fallback_location: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;admin_users_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;js&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;render&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;json: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;result: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;content_type: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"application/json"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the email is sent the server figures out if it was a regular form submission and thus invokes a redirect or if it was a submission via Ajax (our case), it sends back a feedback message in JSON.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am using JSON here because it fits well with the snackbar notifications, but we could send well styled HTML to inject for a richer interaction, same we did in the first part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifying the content type is important, because Rails defaults to &lt;code&gt;text/javascript&lt;/code&gt; for Ajax interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-does-the-client-do-once-it-receives-a-successful-response"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What does the client do once it receives a successful response?
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AjaxController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Controller&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;,]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;detail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// close the panel and go back to the home view&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dispatchEvent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;CustomEvent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;user:tools&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// display success info message&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dispatchEvent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;CustomEvent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;snackbar:add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;detail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The "success" event handler extracts the feedback message sent by the server and then dispatches two &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent/CustomEvent"&gt;custom events&lt;/a&gt; that asynchronously communicate with two different areas of the page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;user:tools&lt;/code&gt; communicates with the Stimulus &lt;code&gt;UsersController&lt;/code&gt; telling it to initiate a navigation back to the initial screen, the "Tools" section. How? Via this line in the HTML of the container page:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;data-action="user:tools@document-&amp;gt;user#fetchAndOpenTools"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;snackbar:add&lt;/code&gt; communicates with the Stimulus &lt;code&gt;SnackbarController&lt;/code&gt; telling it to add a new message to the stack of messages to show the user. &lt;a href="https://dev.to/devteam/how-to-wrap-a-preact-component-into-a-stimulus-controller-1bd0"&gt;I wrote a post if you're interested in how this part works&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the first event is received, the following function is invoked, which triggers an Ajax call, fetching the server side &lt;code&gt;ToolsComponent&lt;/code&gt;'s HTML and displaying it in the UI:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetchAndOpenTools&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;preventDefault&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stopPropagation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Rails&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ajax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toolsComponentPathValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;partial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;replaceTarget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerHTML&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;partial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;documentElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementsByClassName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;js-component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;)[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;outerHTML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;announceChangedSectionToScreenReader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Rails.ajax&lt;/code&gt; is builtin in Rails UJS, not very different from using &lt;code&gt;window.fetch&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's quite a bit going on here, depending on your level of familiarity with the major parts: Rails and Stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion Stimulus is really good to keep vanilla JS organized and to attach behavior to server side rendered HTML markup, in a declarative way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By leveraging Rails builtin Ajax support and thin layer you can add interactivity without having to rely on larger frameworks or having to switch to client side rendering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is something that fits your use case, only you know, but I hope this post showed you how to combine two frameworks to improve the user experience without a steep learning curve and thus increasing the level of developer productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#resources"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Resources
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from countless DuckDuckGo searches (there's little documentation on how to fit all the pieces together) and source code reading, I mainly spent time here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/working_with_javascript_in_rails.html"&gt;Working with JavaScript in Rails&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/reference/controllers"&gt;Stimulus's Reference documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.betterstimulus.com/"&gt;BetterStimulus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/stimulus-components/stimulus-remote-rails"&gt;stimulus-remote-rails&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/forem/forem/pull/14283"&gt;Initial Forem's pull request&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Azure Functions E2E Testing within GitHub Actions</title>
      <author>Justin Yoo</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 15:00:35 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/azure/azure-functions-e2e-testing-within-github-actions-51m2</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/azure/azure-functions-e2e-testing-within-github-actions-51m2</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A while ago, I wrote a blog post about &lt;a href="https://devkimchi.com/2019/08/07/azure-functions-integration-testing-with-mountebank/"&gt;Azure Functions integration testing with Mountebank&lt;/a&gt; and another blog post about &lt;a href="https://devkimchi.com/2019/08/14/azure-functions-sre-on-azure-devops-the-first-cut/"&gt;end-to-end (E2E) testing for Azure Functions&lt;/a&gt;. In the post, I suggested deploying the &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview?WT.mc_id=dotnet-39275-juyoo"&gt;Azure Functions&lt;/a&gt; app first before running the E2E testing. What if you can run the Azure Function app locally within the build pipeline? Then you can get the test result even before the app deployment, which may result in the fail-fast concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this post, I'm going to discuss how to run a function app locally within the build pipeline then run the integration testing scenarios instead of running the E2E testing after the app deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the sample code used in this post at this GitHub repository:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag-github-readme-tag"&gt;
  &lt;div class="readme-overview"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;
      &lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--i3JOwpme--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev.to/assets/github-logo-ba8488d21cd8ee1fee097b8410db9deaa41d0ca30b004c0c63de0a479114156f.svg" alt="GitHub logo"&gt;
      &lt;a href="https://github.com/devkimchi"&gt;
        devkimchi
      &lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://github.com/devkimchi/azure-functions-integration-testing"&gt;
        azure-functions-integration-testing
      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;
      This provides a sample app and test for Azure Functions integration testing in a CI/CD pipeline
    &lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#simple-azure-functions-app"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Simple Azure Functions App
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the straightforward Azure Function app code. I'm using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/azure/azure-functions-openapi-extension"&gt;Azure Functions OpenAPI extension&lt;/a&gt; in this app. It has only one endpoint like below:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag_gist-liquid-tag"&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Run this function app and go to the URL, &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:7071/api/openapi/v3.json&lt;/code&gt;, and you will see the following OpenAPI document.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag_gist-liquid-tag"&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At this stage, my focus is to make sure whether the OpenAPI document is correct or not. As you can see the OpenAPI document above, the document has a very simple data structure under the &lt;code&gt;components.schemas.greeting&lt;/code&gt; node. What if the data type is complex? We need confirmation. In this case, should we deploy the app to Azure and run the endpoint over there? Maybe or maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this time, let's run the app in the build pipeline and test it there, rather than deploying it to Azure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#running-azure-functions-app-as-a-background-process"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Running Azure Functions App as a Background Process
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to test the Azure Functions app locally, it should be running on the local machine, using the &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?WT.mc_id=dotnet-39275-juyoo"&gt;Azure Functions CLI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag_gist-liquid-tag"&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But the issue of this CLI doesn't offer a way to run the app as a background process, something like &lt;code&gt;func start --background&lt;/code&gt;. Therefore, instead of relying on the CLI, we should use the shell command. So, for example, if you use the bash shell, run this &lt;code&gt;func start &amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; command first, then run &lt;code&gt;bg&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag_gist-liquid-tag"&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you use PowerShell, use the &lt;code&gt;Start-Process&lt;/code&gt; cmdlet with the &lt;code&gt;-NoNewWindow&lt;/code&gt; switch so that the function app runs as a background process.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag_gist-liquid-tag"&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Once the function app is running, execute this bash command on the same console session, &lt;code&gt;curl http://localhost:7071/api/openapi/v3.json&lt;/code&gt;. Alternatively, use the PowerShell cmdlet &lt;code&gt;Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get -Uri http://localhost:7071/api/openapi/v3.json&lt;/code&gt; to get the OpenAPI document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#writing-integration-test-codes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Writing Integration Test Codes
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we've got the function app running in the background, we can now write the test codes on top of that. So let's have a look at the code below. First, it sends a GET request to the endpoint, &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:7071/api/openapi/v3.json&lt;/code&gt;, gets the response as a string and deserialises it to &lt;code&gt;OpenApiDocument&lt;/code&gt;, and finally asserts the results whether it's expected or not.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag_gist-liquid-tag"&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the test codes above, there's no mocking. Instead, we just use the actual endpoint running on the local machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the test codes are ready, run the following command:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag_gist-liquid-tag"&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You will get the test results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#putting-altogether-to-github-actions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Putting Altogether to GitHub Actions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We knew how to run the function app as a background process and got the test codes. Our CI/CD pipeline should be able to execute this. Let's have a look at the &lt;a href="https://github.com/features/actions"&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/a&gt; workflow. Some actions are omitted for brevity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#githubhosted-runners"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  GitHub-hosted Runners
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It really depends on the situation, but I'm assuming we should test the code on all the operating systems ‚Äì Windows, Mac and Linux. In this case, use the &lt;code&gt;matrix&lt;/code&gt; attribute.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag_gist-liquid-tag"&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;GitHub-hosted runners don't have the &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?WT.mc_id=dotnet-39275-juyoo"&gt;Azure Functions CLI&lt;/a&gt; installed by default. Therefore, you should install it by yourself.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag_gist-liquid-tag"&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Install the .NET Core 3.1 SDK as well.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag_gist-liquid-tag"&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After all the tools are installed, testing should be followed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following action is for Mac and Linux runners. The first step is to run the function app as a background process. Although you can simply use the command &lt;code&gt;func start&lt;/code&gt;, this action declares &lt;code&gt;func @("start","--verbose","false")&lt;/code&gt; to minimise the noise from the local debugging log messages.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag_gist-liquid-tag"&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the following action is for Windows runner. The main difference from the other action is that this time doesn't use the &lt;code&gt;func&lt;/code&gt; command but the &lt;code&gt;$func&lt;/code&gt; variable. Using the &lt;code&gt;func&lt;/code&gt; command will get the error like &lt;code&gt;This command cannot be run due to the error: %1 is not a valid Win32 application.&lt;/code&gt;. It's because the &lt;code&gt;func&lt;/code&gt; command points to the &lt;code&gt;func.ps1&lt;/code&gt; file, which is the PowerShell script. Instead of using this PowerShell script, you need to call &lt;code&gt;func.cmd&lt;/code&gt; to run the function app as a background process.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag_gist-liquid-tag"&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Once all the GitHub Actions workflow is set, push your codes to GitHub. Then you'll see all the build pipeline works as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PkzeYvR7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://sa0blogs.blob.core.windows.net/devkimchi/2021/08/azure-functions-integration-testing-01.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PkzeYvR7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://sa0blogs.blob.core.windows.net/devkimchi/2021/08/azure-functions-integration-testing-01.png" alt="Build Pipeline on Windows Runner"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NOfidD3I--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://sa0blogs.blob.core.windows.net/devkimchi/2021/08/azure-functions-integration-testing-02.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NOfidD3I--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://sa0blogs.blob.core.windows.net/devkimchi/2021/08/azure-functions-integration-testing-02.png" alt="Build Pipeline on Non-Windows Runner"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;So far, we've walked through how to run the integration testing codes for &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview?WT.mc_id=dotnet-39275-juyoo"&gt;Azure Functions app&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href="https://github.com/features/actions"&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/a&gt; workflow, using &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?WT.mc_id=dotnet-39275-juyoo"&gt;Azure Functions CLI&lt;/a&gt; as a background process. As a result, you can now avoid extra steps for the app deployment to Azure for testing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Liberating Responsibility</title>
      <author>Tony Ryzhikov</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 15:00:03 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/stumbleagain/liberating-responsibility-gpi</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the thoughts below are based solely on my experience and are not universal, just something that works under current circumstances and from my point of view. It‚Äôs ok to disagree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href="https://dodobrands.io/post/dodo-is/"&gt;Dodo Engineering&lt;/a&gt; I conduct some interviews from time to time. Once I met the candidate who was working as a team lead while applying for the software engineer position. So at the end we stumbled upon quite an interesting topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#no-managers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  No managers
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúSo I‚Äôve heard you guys have no managers‚Äù, he asked me. The time for the interview was overdue, but it was the end of the day, so we decided to talk a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúUmm, yes‚Äù, I said. ‚ÄúWe kinda rely on teams being autonomous and keep the structure flat enough. Inside the teams we have an thing called &lt;em&gt;Product Leadership Team&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://alex4zero.medium.com/product-leadership-team-%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BA-%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0-%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0-efd1bba1baab"&gt;(article in Russian)&lt;/a&gt;. It has roles inside like Product Owner, People, Tech or Process Lead that help team in certain aspects. These roles can be assigned to different people in any ratio - it may be one person doing all four, or one role may be distributed between several team members - in any way certain team would prefer‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Rl8flQOd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0%2AnvnT4onRRl7g_zy4.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Rl8flQOd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0%2AnvnT4onRRl7g_zy4.jpeg" alt="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*nvnT4onRRl7g_zy4.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúSo basically you have managers, you just call them differently‚Äù, he smiled a bit. ‚ÄúThese guys or one specific person is telling you what to do. I can‚Äôt speak for everyone, but in my experience it works only when someone have the guidance to tell the others what to do, otherwise it all falls apart‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWell, not exactly‚Äù, I defended, ‚Äúin our case the team decides what to do and how to do it by themselves. The people in the roles I mentioned can help and guide you how to do it in case we face issues.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get it. Who takes the responsibility for the apps, when something‚Äôs happening with the services? ‚Äù, he remained on his own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe team. We have a thing called Component Owners which indicates which guys to contact in case some service is acting weird.‚Äù I thought a bit. ‚ÄúAnd well, yes, the team with the Product Owner is also responsible for doing things the way they forecasted. But we do not blame if something goes bad, just trying to retrospect it all over to avoid same mistakes in the future‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He remained silent for a while, thinking it all over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‚ÄúSo how does it work for you guys‚Äù?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out I was answering this question in my head for a while afterwards‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääin the corner of the background mind. The ‚Äòclick‚Äô feeling came to me at the middle of my shopping list in the grocery store. So figured it‚Äôs time to write it all down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#im-happy-and-i-own%C2%A0it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  I‚Äôm happy and I own¬†it
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general,‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand that‚Äôs what I answered‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit works great. And please trust me when I say this post is not sponsored¬†:]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important part of making it work is the company culture. But usually when someone tells someone else just that, the first response is ‚Äúsounds like yet another corporate bullshit‚Äù. So let's dig in a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When speaking of culture, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339"&gt;Accelerate&lt;/a&gt; (the book that deserves all the glory it receives) mentions Westrum organization culture as a way to determine how organization spreads information. According to Westrum, organizations can be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pathologic‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbased on dominance. The boss tells it employees what to do and how to do it, people are driven by fear, threats and power. Usually it relies on strict deadlines without well-defined integrations‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äòeveryone on his own‚Äô.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bureaucratic‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbased on rules. It‚Äôs usually some hierarchy of set-up rules and strict processes that guide you to your team's specific goals. It creates a lot of really specialized teams and planned integrations between them, but they are rarely driven by some common goal, mostly interested in making it better for their part.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generative‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbased on result. The team needs to do something, and they are in charge of understanding how. They have full set of options for assistance, but no one‚Äôs going to make sure it works but them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please note if you found your organization in here! (image from ‚ÄòAccelerate‚Äô)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I consider Dodo Engineering culture to be generative. So let me try to answer why autonomy works for generative organizations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens when you know the fate of the product is in your hands?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each and every one of your team members treat your services in a much more careful way. You start to think not in terms of nowaday tasks, but in terms of strategy: what will happen if a backing service X goes down and communication was lost? How should the system behave if business would like to follow opportunity Y? It turns out that you embed reliability and other non-functional requirements as part of what you do on everyday basis, because you cannot avoid it‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyour hands are full in it, you see the problems and edge cases from much different angles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This enables transparency on what you do. If you know the cost of error and you know there's no ultimate figure behind your back to doublecheck it all over, you want to make the results of your efforts clear enough so that other people can check it out and may give some advices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This generates trust. As you see, you need to have more stuff on your mind and it‚Äôs quite possible you can‚Äôt carry it all alone. So you need to act together with your team to auto-distribute the needs based on what you figure will be optimal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This enables alignment. Well, yes, &lt;a href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2014/03/27/spotify-engineering-culture-part-1/"&gt;Spotify Model&lt;/a&gt; claims it works otherwise - "alignment creates autonomy", but in this case it‚Äôs mutual ‚Äî‚Ääthe more you act responsible, the more you need to know you‚Äôre not doing bullshit. So as a result you need to have some shared understanding of importance not only with your team members, but in terms of how the organization sees it. And the following questions if we're moving into the right direction enables discussion and collaboration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You treat your product much more carefully. You question the changes, see how they fit the big picture and what will happen if you do it differently. You do not longer see your Product Owner as a person that tells you what‚Äôs important, you start to have your own discussions and trade-offs, which is a key to the healthy product collaboration‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyou need to be on the one page with everything, otherwise the users may be disappointed. If you don‚Äôt own the services, there are more chances you get lost in code and miss the reason we‚Äôre all doing things and the alignment that has been mentioned before will disappear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last but not least, it enables the diversity of views and ramps up the skills to constructively discuss all points of views together. The more people have their own background and understanding on how certain things should be carried on, the more chances you have to make it work altogether.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last but not least, it gives you the motivation to actually change how what you do affect people's lives, since it's actually you making the change. Netflix have something called &lt;a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/culture#informed-captains"&gt;informed captains&lt;/a&gt; to decentralize the decision-making, so sometimes you need to face a choice that will change everything - or you have the power to affect the choice of others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if this is so great, you may ask, why this has not become an industry standart yet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#leadership-at-your%C2%A0service"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Leadership at your¬†service
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It must be mentioned to changing the organization culture to result-oriented requires not only a leap of faith, but also the attitude that the people in the organization should share. So, in other words, one tiny thing should happen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‚ÄúEveryone should become leaders‚Äù&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The things that sound simple might not be so straightforward after all. This means that people would need to change the way the do things and set their own system of priorities. If some person used to act as an advanced typewriter, or, as the internet likes to quote, ‚Äòturn coffee into code‚Äô, this attitude may derail from the other questions one may need to ask‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähow my product is doing, what‚Äôs happening‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand going to happen. This is no longer responsibility of some guy that‚Äôs gonna tell you what to do, it‚Äôs some inside motivation that should hopefully emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And again, it pretty much relies on personalities. One would like to access services from reliability perspective and adapt SRE practices to team routine, the other will be more focused on the product future and user experience, the third would concentrate more on quality, or understanding law changes, or release optimization, or process enhancements, or system design, or hiring, or whatever else you understand the team needs. Of course, you could enable specific role or title for each and every one of them, but usually all those strong parts are mixed together between different people. The important part is the same‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääevery person in the team needs to have the urge, the desire to change things and guide each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually this is the part that we assess on the final interview‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääif the candidate can show these skills or is ready for such changes. From my experience, it‚Äôs very important to be candid and tell the candidate that this the part of the expectations that comes with a job, so that one will acknowledge it and decide if one wants to pursue it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#so-apart-from-that-no-tradeoffs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  So, apart from that, no trade-offs?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or course not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This bit of leadership transformation I mentioned above is what usually happens in the majority of the companies when the engineer becomes the team lead. So since these set of challenged as somewhat known and shared within the comminity, there are some guides on how to follow it‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääto prefer team value over personal one, to delegate, to facilitate, to mentor, to apply decision-making. Mastering these parts takes practice and time. And some of the problems I mentioned below are pretty typical for the new teamleads, while others are tightly interlinked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And also, last but not least, it should be reminded that &lt;em&gt;the engineering team still needs to deliver value&lt;/em&gt;. Imagine the engineers as lumberjacks. So of course they may need to learn how to grow trees, select the best axes and navigate by the sun, but they still need to chop some wood. So in between facilitation and system thinking we still need to ‚Äòturn coffee into code‚Äô. And this is the right-balancing part where it gets more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as you may notice, when this is happening faster on much larger scale there are some growth issues. Again, they might be considered pretty typical, but they are no joke on company level, and we at Dodo Engineering have the data from the pulse surveys to assure it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Y79mX6DB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0%2AgSLduBnh2xaDhOlo" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Y79mX6DB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0%2AgSLduBnh2xaDhOlo" alt="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*gSLduBnh2xaDhOlo"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image from an artist &lt;a href="https://vk.com/by_duran"&gt;https://vk.com/by_duran&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Distress and Burnout&lt;/strong&gt;. As modern scientists claim, stress is something natural driven by desire &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"&gt;to resist change&lt;/a&gt;. However, in always changing environment like this one the organism may not be able to adapt to the stress factors which can lead to burnout - you always feel you are in some buzzed state, you cannot rechange. Again, this bit is somewhat familiar in the software engineer's community and some may consider it a matter of fashion, but I think in general modern society bumped into the burnout in a pretty hard way recently and it‚Äôs good to acknowledge the problem at a large scale. So the advice is to do things based on what gives you joy, go on long vacations. There‚Äôs no point in working in sake of it if you can‚Äôt and it doesn‚Äôt give you joy. Talk about it, address it, determine it at the early stages, don't be afraid to tell someone that you feel that way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cannot focus&lt;/strong&gt;. This can be detected as a symptom of the distress as well, but I wanted to address the general feeling of overwhelming. When you have something else has just happened in the middle of your routine gives you a small piece of joy, so you want to drop everything you do and go there. So the feeling of being 'in the zone' is something very helpful in performing complex activities, like software engineering, and unability to focus onto them makes it very hard for you to perform them. The usual recommendation would be to forecast you efforts in advance, to use your calendar wisely, to be able to say 'no'. In our team we started a duty practice for the requests of external development teams or support, so that the other people have more time to spend on something without context switches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xb6vc811--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/m74tt5whakr4tz6ncb9i.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xb6vc811--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/m74tt5whakr4tz6ncb9i.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(I find it very amusing that the term 'context switchcing' originated from software engineering matches that good to what actual engineers feel in their everyday work)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anxiety&lt;/strong&gt;. Lots of it! You cannot be sure you‚Äôre doing a good job‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääare your products good? Are you following product vision fine? Haven‚Äôt we forgotten something essential? Of couse there‚Äôs no universal recipe for this, but good metrics, team support, enough sleep time and therapy sessions can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hard to let it go&lt;/strong&gt;. The more you assign on you, the harder it becomes to let something go, to not remain the best at it. The only thing I could recommend here is to figure out what you want to do, then rationalize your areas based on it - and trust the people around you to help you. If this activity won‚Äôt help, this may happen naturally over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibility bias.&lt;/strong&gt; It's something similar to what cognitives sciences like to call &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect"&gt;bystander effect&lt;/a&gt; - if a person have some accident in the middle of the street, the more people you have around, the less chance the person will receive help - because everyone expects in from someone else. This is something that is very observable in big teams - some nasty bug in legacy system would likely receive less attention because everyone expect anyone else to step up. In this case, the smaller the team is and the more accountable their members are, then there are way less chances that this would be happening on a regular basis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;Not my job"&lt;/strong&gt; attitude. This is an extremely complex topic that deserves a separate article. The more your company scales, the more complicated it becomes to understand how all parts of your service behaves. Usually there's some kind of platform team that shares the expertize in this, but depending on how it's implemented the service ownership not always fully remains on the team. The point of DevOps as a culture to remove this 'us and them' barrier is something the engineers would need to pay attention to, especially in modern cloud-based development. If the team is not aware on how your application works in production, regarding the way it's deployed, hosted and configured, the more the real ownership and responsibility is diffused. This may lead to the scenario when engineers are not responsible on the way their service operates, which kind of brings down all of the whole autonomy and responsibility ideas. But breaking this particular wheel requires some kind of cultural shift to happen, which may not come out naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feature/Ownership duality.&lt;/strong&gt; My favourite one! The longer you dwell on both technical excellence and product changes impacting business value, the harder it becomes to balance it out. Imagine you have two hats on you that you juggle on while deciding what better to do next sprint. I personally consider it normal and something worth adjusting for, but it may feel different from most of the approaches based on personalized role-based discussion. For example, American judicial system have representative for the People (prosecutor) against the defendant (defence attorney). Usually I either witnessed similar 'count hearings' or the huge leap into specific direction, but in the metaphor I presented the whole count including the jury rests on the team members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;strong&gt;all of it takes time&lt;/strong&gt;. You need much more alignment! You need to talk not only by your regular Scrum routine, but based on what you do, and you get eventully tired of it. I have a friend that shifted to leadership position recently, and he was saying to me 'I don't get it why I'm getting paid so much, I work like three hours a day'. And when I asked why he's late after work to meet up all the time, he answered: &lt;em&gt;'Well, I'm talking about my actual work, not meetings and stuff'.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'Meetings and stuff' become part of what you do, you need to control its amount, make sure it doesn't blow your work time to the extremes, treat it as a part of you job responsbilities to **&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;deliver value&lt;/em&gt; and see if the meetings are short, actionable and help you in your everyday work&lt;/strong&gt;.** If they are not, it can become the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#so-what-about-product-leadership-team"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  So what about Product Leadership Team?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all the obstacles shared, you may ask me, if it's that hard to make autonomous teams work, then what's the point? And here's the missing piece - we have the Product Leadership Team I mentioned at the top of the article. Their role is to ensure and guide the team in being productive. In a way, if the team is mature enough or trade-offs are something that does not apply to them, they may not need this team 'as is' or some of the roles*. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to match what roles can assist in which areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People lead

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distress, Anxiety, Burnout, Fear of letting go, Lack of time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Process lead

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Burnout, Lack of Focus, Responsibility Bias, Feature/Ownership duality, Lack of time,  Lack of focus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Product Owner

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Responsibility Bias, Feature/Ownership duality, Lack of focus, Lack of time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tech Lead

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anxiety, Feature/Ownership duality, Fear of letting go, 'Not my job', Lack of focus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually roles are assigned to people with some experience who have been through all this stuff, so that the engineers would feel safer addressing there problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, different teams require different kind of help. These roles can perform all sorts of activities, including organizational, administrative, facilitative, coaching, visionary, servant leadership, expertize enabling, team forming and so many more. But note - I don't say in specifics what these roles &lt;strong&gt;should do&lt;/strong&gt;. I merely wanted to show what they &lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt; do, including in scope of engineering obstacles from above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the fun part - as you may see, since the obstacles are tightly coupled, the needs of the leadership team are coupled as well, so they need to talk to each other and address the issues from different angles, to work as a team on another level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All I said is true, apart from the Product Owners who act as a main person responsible on how the product works. The things one can do varies, but the role stays on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#so-tell-me-was-it-worth-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  So tell me, was it worth it?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another topic I have to mention. So yes, I tell you guys that it's all great or whatever, but how can I prove it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The straightforward way would be to track the team velocity and the set of metrics from &lt;a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/state-of-devops-2019.pdf"&gt;State of DevOps&lt;/a&gt; as lead time, change failure rate and so on. But in order to do that, we need to have some teams that work differently within one company and ideally in the same product. &lt;em&gt;So you won't see any metrics comparison from me, because I don't have this data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I can try to identify the circumstances when &lt;strong&gt;it can work better&lt;/strong&gt; than the traditional manager-based teams. Here's what I have in mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Clear product vision&lt;/strong&gt;. If you don't have a product that you work on and improve on, the whole idea falls apart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Your team is small&lt;/strong&gt;. The more people you have, the harder it would be to communicate and take ownership without stepping on each other's toes. The chances are some sub-teams would emerge organically. Scrum recommends team size between 3 and 9, I'd lower it down to 6. Unless you're using things like &lt;a href="https://less.works/"&gt;LeSS&lt;/a&gt;, then still consider small feature teams as an outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Everything may change.&lt;/strong&gt; If the nature of your activity is pretty monotonous and easily predictable, the desire to take and change ownership areas and responsibility may be smaller. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework"&gt;Cynefin framework&lt;/a&gt; call it 'Simple' quadrant - if everything that your would need and do is determined with a very good prediction rates, the pros of extended autonomy won't that easily overwhelm the odds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Your team needs to delivery value frequently.&lt;/strong&gt; If your stakeholders and C-level guys prefer to operate in large release cycles with vast stabilisation phases and predefined schedule, the value of autonomous teams is significantly reduced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Your services' health is critical for the stakeholders&lt;/strong&gt;. Usually tradiditional managers do a lot of communication and planning and team-related activities, so the technical excellence still relies on the team. And the more your company is interested in the reliability and availability of your services, the more proactive assistance you may need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Your company culture supports autonomy&lt;/strong&gt;. That's all great, but if it gets active resisistance from within, consider wisely on your ability to change the way the company operates. It's possible, but usually beraucratic and especially pathologic companies resist it, and takes great motivation and teammate support to change it - if it's worth it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot say we have a magic potion to overcome the trade-offs I mentioned and we still have some work to do while we grow. But I think we're moving at right direction and I did a fair job answering the original question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are currently hiring engineers to join our team - visit &lt;a href="https://dodo.dev/"&gt;https://dodo.dev/&lt;/a&gt; to learn more and see if what I'm telling is true.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Run your LoRaWAN gateway with your own The Things Stack network server on a Raspberry Pi and balena</title>
      <author>Marc Pous</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/mpous/run-your-lorawan-gateway-with-your-own-the-things-stack-network-server-on-a-raspberry-pi-and-balena-4o4n</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Running this project you can have all the LoRaWAN stack (Basics Station gateway + The Things Stack network server) running together on a single Raspberry Pi, LoRa concentrator and balena. Using containers on balena means that it can run alongside with other services such as the balena LoRaWAN BasicsTM Station gateway and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fNGpbVCi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/efth4rdpw296627ykrc4.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fNGpbVCi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/efth4rdpw296627ykrc4.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-lora-and-lorawan"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is LoRa and LoRaWAN
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the concept of the Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN). LPWAN enable to set up tiny sensors running with batteries far away from the base stations and still send data during a lot of time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LoRa is a radio modulation meant for Long Range communication using very little power to send data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LoRaWAN is a Media Acces Layer (MAC) protocol. A software layer that defines how devices use LoRa to transmit and receive messages on a network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zr7N8lMc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cechj4uxy2yqar4u20vc.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zr7N8lMc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cechj4uxy2yqar4u20vc.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LoRaWAN (LoRa Wide Area Network) is an example of LPWAN. Using LoRa (Long Range) radio-frequencies, you can send tiny packages of data over long distances (even miles away depending on the topology) with simple battery-powered devices. The radio packets are captured by gateways which relay over the Internet the LoRa packages to network servers.&lt;br&gt;
The Things Stack is an example of a LoRaWAN network server. The Things Stack (previously The Things Network) is being run on the The Things Industries clusters that are distributed worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;

  Why is this Running on a Raspberry Pi instead of a cloud?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to manage your own data without sharing it with any cloud provider, the data collected can‚Äôt leave your country, or other similar requirements, then the solution is to deploy The Things Stack LoRaWAN Network Server using balena on a Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a professional that needs to build your ad-hoc LoRaWAN private network for tests or others, this is a great and unexpensive solution. And if you are a community or company who need a tiny private LoRaWAN network server, this could be just enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people says that a Raspberry Pi is to small for this type of job, but it has been running for weeks with good performance with tiny amount of LoRa nodes. Needs to be tested on a bigger environment. Feel free to bring your feedback here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raspberry Pi 3 or 4 (or similar Compute Module carrier boards).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SD card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power supply&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;LoRa concentrator (SX1301 or SX1302) (e.g. RAK 2245, RAK 2287 among others)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/"&gt;balenaCloud&lt;/a&gt; account&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://balena.io/etcher"&gt;balena Etcher&lt;/a&gt; to flash the SD card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#deploy-the-basics-station-gateway-with-the-things-stack-network-server"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Deploy the Basics Station gateway with The Things Stack network server
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To deploy the Basics(TM) Station gateway service along TTS local network server on your Raspberry Pi, click the &lt;a href="https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/deploy?repoUrl=https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/deploy?repoUrl=https://github.com/xoseperez/the-things-stack-basicstation-balena"&gt;Deploy with balena here&lt;/a&gt; or go to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/xoseperez/the-things-stack-basicstation-balena"&gt;Github repo&lt;/a&gt; to click the Deploy with balena button to automatically deploy the application on balenaCloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/deploy?repoUrl=https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/deploy?repoUrl=https://github.com/xoseperez/the-things-stack-basicstation-balena"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--l3sDPIqw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/or4c4wpa91kz427lt6xk.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clicking the deploy button will create a fleet with all the necessary code to deploy your The Things Stack plus basicstation service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs time to connect your LoRa concentrator compatible with your Raspberry Pi or balena Fin (SX1301, or SX1302 and SX1303 such as RAK2245 or RAK 2287), to run the LoRaWAN gateway running alongside with The Things Stack network server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember to add or modify the variable &lt;code&gt;MODEL&lt;/code&gt; depending on the LoRa concentrator model you have (SX1301, SX1302 or SX1303). By default is set to SX1301.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should see something similar on balenaCloud as below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cOlFDgyl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lg6j069euyymu3dhke9j.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cOlFDgyl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lg6j069euyymu3dhke9j.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will notice that the services will reboot a few times, this is normal behaviour to set up all the services properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#register-the-gateway-at-your-private-the-things-stack"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Register the gateway at your private The Things Stack
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copy your local IP address and paste it into the browser with https. Accept the self-signed certificate that the device has generated automatically for your local IP address. Alternatevaly feel free to use the public URL generated by balenaCloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HvgOvd0E--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pes3wm3j9ptck7ft7pe9.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HvgOvd0E--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pes3wm3j9ptck7ft7pe9.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Login using the credentials User ID &lt;code&gt;admin&lt;/code&gt; and the password &lt;code&gt;changeme&lt;/code&gt;. Feel free to change your Password after you log in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--y070AT_c--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3eyoh4tsoneflgkj0von.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--y070AT_c--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3eyoh4tsoneflgkj0von.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click &lt;code&gt;Register a gateway&lt;/code&gt; and then &lt;code&gt;Add new Gateway&lt;/code&gt;. Copy the EUI that the basicstation service introduces as a TAG of on the balenaCloud dashboard. Paste it as the EUI of the gateway when registering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--i0CqprQD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1q416345mgm99x60701m.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--i0CqprQD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1q416345mgm99x60701m.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the gateway is registered and it's time to generate an API Key. Go to &lt;code&gt;Add API Key&lt;/code&gt;, then select &lt;code&gt;Link as a Gateway to a Gateway Server for traffic exchange, i.e. write uplink and red downlink&lt;/code&gt;. Click the button &lt;code&gt;Create API key&lt;/code&gt;. Remember to copy the key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iPLRIn-z--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nqlbra067y02orvmzyi6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iPLRIn-z--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nqlbra067y02orvmzyi6.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paste the key on the balenaCloud &lt;code&gt;Device Variables&lt;/code&gt; of the device on balenaCloud as &lt;code&gt;TC_KEY&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gateway registered will be online on your private The Things Stack network server and able to receive data from your LoRa nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project involves a lot of services running together. If there is any issue not reported here, feel free to report it at the &lt;a href="https://forums.balena.io/"&gt;balena forums&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
