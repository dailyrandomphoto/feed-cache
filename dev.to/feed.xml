      <title>Why you can't name a file 'CON' in Windows</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/apoorvtyagi/why-you-can-t-name-a-file-con-in-windows-41ok</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;❓ Did you know you can’t name a file “Con” in Windows&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re running a Windows machine, try it right now. &lt;strong&gt;Go to File Explorer -&amp;gt; create a new folder -&amp;gt; name it "Con"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did it work? Now try with "PRN", "AUX" or "NUL". What did you get?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably this 👇&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--O1-UaV9Y--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624010275461/kIHbPV7Ij.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--O1-UaV9Y--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624010275461/kIHbPV7Ij.png" alt="Invalid.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system will not let you do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Con is an English word, and there are a few human names like Connor who goes by the nickname 'Con'. So if you’re trying to save a photo of one of them using their nickname on Windows, you will not able to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the system won't let you name a file or folder &lt;code&gt;CON&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;AUX&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PRN&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;LST&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;COM0&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;COM9&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;LPT0&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;LPT9&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;NUL&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#but-why-windows-doesnt-allow-this"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  But why Windows doesn’t allow this?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for that goes back to MS-DOS, one of the oldest command lines from the 80s. In MS-DOS, all those words that are mentioned above are the names of &lt;strong&gt;device files&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were a quick and clever way of letting programs on a computer interact with other hardware like printers, keyboards, and basically anything that you can plug in. Rather than every program having to learn to communicate with every possible device, that job was given to a "device driver".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was done so that programmers didn’t have to worry about how every single type of hardware device like printers worked. Instead, they could reuse code that they already had for reading and writing files from and to the printer. They would just have to save whatever they wanted to print to this "device file".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that even when a new printer came out with new features in it and if the manufacturer would bundle a new driver with it, all the old programs would still work, in the same way as they always did, and the driver would deal with the dirty stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#backward-compatibility"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Backward Compatibility
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you type "dir" in your windows terminal, you’d get a listing on the screen of whatever files were in the current directory or folder. Typing "dir", adding a redirect symbol(&amp;gt;) after that, and mentioning a file name at last, would then save the listing on that file instead of the listing going to the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you tried to save it to a file called "LPT1", the system would spot that file name, and instead of going to the hard disk, your list will be sent to the device driver for the parallel port, the one that was labeled LPT1 on the back of your computer. The place where you have a printer plugged in. So even knowing anything about how the parallel port or printer worked, you could just print stuffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windows 10 probably don't use parallel port now but the reason why these reserved words still exist till now is because of &lt;strong&gt;backward compatibility&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windows 10 retains code from the days of Windows 3.1, and Windows 3.1 was created with MS-DOS as basic, so was Windows 95. With Windows NT this did not happen, but still, Microsoft wanted it to be compatible with Windows 95, and Windows 10 is still partly based on Windows NT. So those were the reserved words in MS-DOS in the 80s and they still continue to be reserved words in Windows in 2021&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost no one may use a parallel port to connect a printer anymore, but Microsoft chooses to continue to support extremely old software and devices to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we saw why you can't name a file or a folder "Con" in Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early times of MS-DOS, computers were basically a black screen with text and nothing else. So everything worked by writing orders. For a program to interact with other things, such as a printer, a command had to be written using a text file or “device file” that would interact with a driver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the device, it has a name reserved. For example, the parallel ports that printers used to connect to use LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, LPT4, LPT5, LPT6, LPT7, LPT8, and LPT9. The serial ports has reserved COM from COM1 to COM9. "CON" represents the console etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this day those device names are reserved so that you cannot create usable files or folders with them. If back then you tried to do something like creating a file called LPT1.txt, what you were going to do was send it to the printer or something like that and that’s why they were blocked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you learned something new today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading :))&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Docker CMD vs ENTRYPOINT: explaining the difference</title>
      <author>Andrea Cappuccio</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 26 Jun 2021 11:24:31 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/hood/docker-cmd-vs-entrypoint-explaining-the-difference-55g7</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/hood/docker-cmd-vs-entrypoint-explaining-the-difference-55g7</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We IT people &lt;em&gt;LOVE&lt;/em&gt; tinkering with new tech stuff, and Docker is no exception. As a matter of fact,  Docker was ranked as the #1 most wanted platform, #2 most loved platform, and #3 most broadly used platform in the &lt;a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted"&gt;2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey&lt;/a&gt;, and  #1 most wanted platform, #2 most loved platform and #3 most popular platform in &lt;a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#overview"&gt;the 2020 edition of the same survey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you've bumped into this article, chances are that you have been bamboozled by the &lt;del&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3d/d6/ee/3dd6ee6d8b5c9979e0cbe1d7daafada9.jpg"&gt;fruit doggo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/del&gt; difference between the &lt;code&gt;CMD&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ENTRYPOINT&lt;/code&gt; instructions defined in a Dockerfile, used to describe how a Docker container should be run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#but-whats-a-docker-container"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  But what's a Docker container?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Containers are lightweight, standalone, executable packages of software designed for running specific tasks, no matter if short-lived or long-running. Therefore, a container's lifecycle depends on the ongoing process inside of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the process stops, the container stops as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ok-but-what-role-is-our-dockerfile-playing-here"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Ok, but what role is our Dockerfile playing here?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Containers are dependent on images and use them to construct a run-time environment in order to run an application. A Dockerfile is a script which role is to define the process which leads to the creation of a final image, and how to run a container bound to said image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of creating a Docker image usually begins with a &lt;code&gt;FROM&lt;/code&gt; command, defining a base image to build our image upon. We usually follow up with a bunch of &lt;code&gt;RUN&lt;/code&gt; instructions, used to run commands which modify the underlying filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each &lt;code&gt;RUN&lt;/code&gt; instruction creates a new image layer that contains a modification to the filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#fine-now-what-about-the-cmd-vs-entrypoint-stuff"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Fine. Now what about the CMD vs ENTRYPOINT stuff?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;CMD&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ENTRYPOINT&lt;/code&gt; are two different types of instructions used to define how a Docker container should be run. &lt;br&gt;
Let's dive into the details of each one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cmd"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  CMD
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;CMD&lt;/code&gt; instruction defines the default command used to run a Docker container from an image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given a simple image like the following:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight docker"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; alpine&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;CMD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; ["echo", "Hello, World!"]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Running it with:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight docker"&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker container run my-container
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Will yield the following result:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight docker"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Hello, World!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Dockerfile can contain multiple &lt;code&gt;CMD&lt;/code&gt; instructions, but every single one of them, except for the last one, will be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;CMD&lt;/code&gt; instruction can be overridden by the arguments passed to &lt;code&gt;docker container run&lt;/code&gt;, like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight docker"&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker container run my-container echo "Hello again!"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Will yield:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight docker"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Hello again!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#entrypoint"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ENTRYPOINT
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ENTRYPOINT&lt;/code&gt; instructions define, just like their CMD siblings, the default command used to start a container.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight docker"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; alpine&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;ENTRYPOINT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; ["echo", "Hello, World!"]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Will yield:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight docker"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Hello, World!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cool-so-whats-the-difference-at-this-point"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cool, so... what's the difference at this point?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, the main difference is that, if both a &lt;code&gt;CMD&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ENTRYPOINT&lt;/code&gt; instructions are defined inside a Dockerfile, the &lt;code&gt;CMD&lt;/code&gt; instruction will be concatenated to the &lt;code&gt;ENTRYPOINT&lt;/code&gt; one:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight docker"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; alpine&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;ENTRYPOINT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; ["echo"]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;CMD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; ["Hello, World!"]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wil lead to us seeing:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight docker"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Hello, World!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also, while &lt;code&gt;CMD&lt;/code&gt; instructions are, by design, made do be easily overridden by passing arguments to &lt;code&gt;docker container run&lt;/code&gt; commands, &lt;code&gt;ENTRYPOINT&lt;/code&gt; have purposely been made harder to override manually, by forcing user to use a &lt;code&gt;--entrypoint&lt;/code&gt; flag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#this-leads-us-to-a-pattern"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  This leads us to a pattern
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This design leads us to a consistent pattern. And we like patterns, patterns are good for our mental health:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can use &lt;code&gt;ENTRYPOINT&lt;/code&gt; to define a base command which always gets executed, and &lt;code&gt;CMD&lt;/code&gt; to  define default arguments for this command, easily overridable by passing custom args to &lt;code&gt;docker container run&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Modern Javascript Development Environment</title>
      <author>Nikhil</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 26 Jun 2021 11:18:42 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/tech_nikkhil/modern-javascript-development-environment-nik</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/tech_nikkhil/modern-javascript-development-environment-nik</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, the web app codebase is increasing, and using a single script.js file to fit the entire javascript code in one file is not a good practice in terms of page load time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's have a brief introduction about how a Modern Javascript Development Environment works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We divide our entire project into multiple &lt;code&gt;modules&lt;/code&gt;, then these modules can share data between them and make our code more organized and maintainable. Now what's great about modules is we can use third-party modules within our application. There are various packages shared on the NPM repository which can be used e.g. React, Leaflet and etc. NPM stands for &lt;code&gt;Node Package Manager&lt;/code&gt; because it was originally built for Node.js and for Node.js However, NPM has established itself as the goto repository for all kinds of packages in &lt;code&gt;Modern JavaScript Development&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So basically NPM is both the repository in which packages live and a program that we use on our computers to install and manage these packages. So let's say that we are done writing our project code, we divided it into multiple modules and we included some 3rd-party modules as well. And so now the development step is complete. Now, this is not the end of the story. At least not when rebuilding a real-world application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, our project now needs to go through a build process, where one big final JavaScript bundle is built. And that's the final file, which we will deploy to our web server for production. So basically it's the JavaScript file, that will be sent to browsers in production. And production simply means that the application is being used by real users in the real world. Now, a build process can be something really complex, but keeping it simple here and can be divided into two major steps. And the first step, we'll bundle all our modules together into one big file. This is a pretty complex process that can eliminate unused code and compress code as well. Now, this step is super important for two big reasons. First, older browsers don't support modules at all. And so code that's in a module could not be executed by any older browser. And second, it's also better for performance to send fewer files to the browser, and it's also beneficial that the bundling step compresses our code. But anyway, as the second step, we do something called &lt;code&gt;Transpiling&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Polyfilling&lt;/code&gt;, which is basically to convert all modern JavaScript syntax and features back to old ES5 syntax, so that even older browsers can understand our code without breaking. And this is usually done using a tool called &lt;code&gt;Babel&lt;/code&gt;. So these are the two steps of our build process, and after these two steps, we end up with that final JavaScript bundle, ready to be deployed on a server for &lt;code&gt;production&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, of course, we don't perform these steps ourselves. Instead, we use a special tool to implement this build process for us. And the most common build tools available, are probably &lt;code&gt;Webpack&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Parcel&lt;/code&gt;. And these are called JavaScript bundlers because well, as the name says they take our raw code and transform it into a JavaScript bundle. Now &lt;code&gt;Webpack&lt;/code&gt; is the more popular one, but it can be really hard and confusing to set it up. So that's because there's a lot of stuff that we need to configure manually, in order to make it work properly. &lt;code&gt;Parcel&lt;/code&gt;, on the other hand, is a zero-configuration bundler, which simply works out of the box. And so in this bundler, we don't have to write any setup code, which is really amazing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oops, Probably it wasn't a brief introduction. But let's now deep dive into the topics step by step&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-overview-of-modules-importing-and-exporting-in-es6-modules"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;1. Overview of Modules, Importing and Exporting in ES6 Modules&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's understand this by the example of Car. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--j5hos-Pd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624615116723/q4OCp-BCH.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--j5hos-Pd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624615116723/q4OCp-BCH.png" alt="car.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are various components of Car which are built in isolation, where each component has its own functionality. These all when combined with their functionalities and working make a complete Car in working. In the same way, &lt;code&gt;modules&lt;/code&gt; are small &lt;code&gt;reusable&lt;/code&gt; components that can be imported and exported between them and combined to form a bigger application. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advantages of Modules:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Composition&lt;/code&gt;:  These small building blocks put together to build complex applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Isolation&lt;/code&gt;: Modules are developed in isolation without thinking about other codebases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Abstraction&lt;/code&gt;: Hiding implementation details from other components and only sharing functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Organization&lt;/code&gt;: Modules lead to a more organized codebase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Reusability&lt;/code&gt;: Modules can be easily used with other projects for their specific functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's know what's the difference between a module and a script.js file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ppH5kLQF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624704737725/47JP0nOm6.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ppH5kLQF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624704737725/47JP0nOm6.jpeg" alt="20210626_161544-min.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's take a look at Behind the scenes: How ES6 Modules are imported&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;//1. index.html

    &amp;lt;script type="module" defer src="index.js"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;

// 2. getCoords.js

const getCoords = function () {
    //return latitude and longitude
    return { lat: 57.9, lng: 63.99 }
}

export { getCoords }

// 3. displayCountry.js

const displayCountry = function (lat, lng) {
    //some code here
    console.log(`You're in India. Welcome to India`);
}

export { displayCountry }

//4. index.js

import { getCoords } from './assets/getCoords'
import { displayCountry } from './assets/displayCountry'


const { lat: latitude, lng: longitude } = getCoords()

displayCountry(latitude, longitude)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above example, let's understand the parsing of index.js file step by step: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asynchronous downloading of &lt;code&gt;getCoords.js&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;displayCountry.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linking imports to &lt;code&gt;getCoords.js&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;displayCountry.js&lt;/code&gt; respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Execution of &lt;code&gt;getCoords.js&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;displayCountry.js&lt;/code&gt; respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Execution of &lt;code&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few things to keep in mind, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imports are always hoisted in importing module&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ES6 Modules are live connections between each other, not COPIES. Infact import is just 
reference to that module.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-use-import-and-export-in-es6"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to Use Import and Export in ES6?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make &lt;code&gt;objects&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;functions&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;classes&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;variables&lt;/code&gt; available to the outside world it’s as simple as &lt;code&gt;exporting&lt;/code&gt; them and then &lt;code&gt;importing&lt;/code&gt; them where needed in other files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exporting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can export members one by one. Members which are not exported won't be available outside the module.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;export const frontendFrameworks = ['React', 'Angular', 'Vue']

const hobbies = ['Singing', 'Football', 'Movies']  
// Not available outside module

export const student = {
    name: 'Nikhil',
    birthYear: '1999',
    education: 'Graduate',
    university: 'ABC'
}


&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Or we can export desired members in a single statement at the end of the module:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;export {frontendFrameworks, student}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exporting with alias&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also give aliases to exported members with the as keyword:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;export { frontendFrameworks, student as user }

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Default Export&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can define a default export with the &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; keyword:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;export default function displayCity(){

console.log(`You're in Mumbai. Welcome to Mumbai!`)

}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importing is also very straightforward, with the &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; keyword, members to be imported in curly brackets and then the location of the module relative to the current file:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import {frontendFrameworks, student} from 'app.js'

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importing with alias&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also alias members at import time:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import student as user from 'app.js'

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importing all exported members&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can import everything that’s imported by a module. This allows us to access members with dot notation :&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import * as Utils from 'app.js'

/* While accessing */
Utils.displayCity()

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importing a module with a default member&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You import the default member by &lt;code&gt;giving it a name of your choice&lt;/code&gt;. In the following example &lt;code&gt;Cart&lt;/code&gt; is the name given to the imported default member:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import Cart from 'app.js'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Along with the default one you import non-default members like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import Cart, { frontendFrameworks, student } from 'app.js'

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OMG !🤯 This was a very long explanation. I hope you understand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now as development of a project is completed, modules are coded with their functionalities. Let's move forward with NPM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-2-why-we-need-npm-whats-purpose-of-using-it-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ** 2. Why we need NPM? What's purpose of using it? **
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;NPM&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a package manager for Node.js with hundreds of thousands of packages. Although it does create some of your directory structure/organization, this is not the main purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal, is automated dependency and package management. This means that you can specify all of your project's dependencies inside your &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; file, then any time you (or anyone else) needs to get started with your project they can just run &lt;code&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt; and immediately have all of the dependencies installed. On top of this, it is also possible to specify what versions your project depends upon to prevent updates from breaking your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is definitely possible to manually download your libraries, copy them into the correct directories, and use them that way. However, as your project (and list of dependencies) grows, this will quickly become time-consuming and messy. It also makes collaborating and sharing your project that much more difficult.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ npm init 
/*Ths would initialize npm in the folder*/

$ npm install
/*This will install npm, you will see a package.json file and
 inside the folder a node_ modules folder is added.
This node_modules contains all dependencies required for a project*/

/*Package .json consists of */
{
  "name": "test",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" &amp;amp;&amp;amp; exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
}

/*Now if we want to have leaflet library for our project*/

$npm install leaflet@version_num

/*The leaflet library gets added to node_modules folder 
and in package.json leaflet is added into dependencies. 
Package.json changes to*/

{
  "name": "test",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" &amp;amp;&amp;amp; exit 1"
  },
"dependencies": {
    "leaflet": "^1.7.1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
}



&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tip: While uploading your code to Git or copying it from some source to destination, never include &lt;code&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; folder. There is no sense to move that folder as all the dependencies can be installed just by &lt;code&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this makes it more clear what the &lt;code&gt;purpose of npm&lt;/code&gt; is. As a Javascript developer (both client-side and server-side), NPM is an indispensable tool in modern and huge applications workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now after installing all dependencies, we can't run the file &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; in browser. As browser doesn't understand modules. We need to convert these entire modules to scripts this process is called &lt;strong&gt;Bundling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-3-bundling-with-parcel-and-its-purpose-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ** 3. Bundling with Parcel and it's purpose **
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are various tools for &lt;code&gt;Bundling&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Webpack&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Parcel&lt;/code&gt; are most used. &lt;code&gt;Webpack&lt;/code&gt; requires a config file to setup the configurations but &lt;code&gt;Parcel&lt;/code&gt; doesn't require configuration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's move further with &lt;code&gt;Parcel&lt;/code&gt; and how it is used?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;strong&gt;Parcel&lt;/strong&gt; is a development tool we install it as a dev dependency like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ npm install parcel --save-dev

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It gets added to the package.json file as:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  "name": "test",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" &amp;amp;&amp;amp; exit 1"
  },
"dependencies": {
    "leaflet": "^1.7.1"
  },
"devDependencies": {
    "parcel": "^2.0.0-beta.2"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now it's time to use parcel for bundling we run following command:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ npx parcel index.html

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It converts entire modules into script and bundles &lt;code&gt;html&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;css&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;js&lt;/code&gt; files into scripts and creates a folder named &lt;code&gt;dist&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ksTecERJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624701240916/U7j3D46yR.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ksTecERJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624701240916/U7j3D46yR.png" alt="dr.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It gives us a deployed server address like in terminal &lt;strong&gt;Server running at &lt;a href="http://localhost:1234"&gt;http://localhost:1234&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now whenever we change modules and save them, the server gets auto reloaded, due to which states are lost of the file. So to overcome this, &lt;code&gt;Parcel&lt;/code&gt; includes a feature of &lt;code&gt;Hot Module Replacement&lt;/code&gt;. Hot Module Replacement (HMR) improves the development experience by automatically updating modules in the browser at runtime without needing a whole page refresh. This means that the application state can be retained as you change small things. This will only apply in development; HMR is automatically disabled when bundling in production mode.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (module.hot) {
  module.hot.accept()
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parcel&lt;/strong&gt; is also smart enough to find path for the importing modules. This works for all types of &lt;code&gt;assets&lt;/code&gt; like &lt;code&gt;css&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sass&lt;/code&gt; which means:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;/*importing module*/

/*Lets say we want to import react library*/

import React from './node_modules/react'

/*No need to specify path as shown above*/

import React from 'react';

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now there's another way to run the scripts instead of everytime giving command &lt;code&gt;parcel index.html&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
We automate this by adding scripts to the package.json file according to our needs.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
{
  "name": "test",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" &amp;amp;&amp;amp; exit 1",
    "start": "parcel index.html",
    "build": "parcel build index.html"
  },
"dependencies": {
    "leaflet": "^1.7.1"
  },
"devDependencies": {
    "parcel": "^2.0.0-beta.2"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This allows us to run scripts by &lt;code&gt;$ npm run start&lt;/code&gt; and build a bundle for entire project with &lt;code&gt;$npm run build&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
After building the bundle, now you can deploy the dist folder wherever you want on any hosting service. You only need to upload this dist folder on &lt;code&gt;Netlify&lt;/code&gt; or any hosting services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now there's a doubt that all ES6 features which we might have used in our scripts like arrow function, or spread operator, or let, const etc., these are supported by modern browsers what about the old ones, our application won't run on them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, it's not like that, our bundle will work for all types of browsers. This is because &lt;strong&gt;Parcel&lt;/strong&gt; has built-in transpiler named &lt;strong&gt;Babel&lt;/strong&gt; which converts ES6 specifications to ES5. You can have a look at functions in bundled scripts how arrow functions are converted to normal functions and used. All the unused characters like spaces are removed and a minified version in created and unused code is eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope it wasn't boring enough! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have read it till the end, you must have understood extremely well. Don't forget to follow me on  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Tech_Nikkhil"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you find it useful do share it with your friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be posting more such articles. Thanks for reading it till the end.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AWS SDK with Javascript: Upload File to S3</title>
      <author>ldsrogan</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 26 Jun 2021 10:50:31 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/ldsrogan/aws-sdk-with-javascript-upload-file-to-s3-2cm1</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/ldsrogan/aws-sdk-with-javascript-upload-file-to-s3-2cm1</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the second article about using AWS SDK in JavaScript to upload files to S3.&lt;br&gt;
If you are interested in the previous article, please checkout the following link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/ldsrogan/aws-sdk-with-javascript-download-file-from-s3-el2"&gt;AWS-SDK Download File From S3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#initial-setup-in-aws"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Initial Setup in AWS
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;please make sure that you have AWS account with admin authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you logged in AWS, you should create a policy, attach it to your account, and then create an access key. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not going to talk about all the detail of how to set up for AWS, so if you want to know how to do this, please refer to the  &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html"&gt;AWS Official Documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And When you create a policy for file uploading, you should include the following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Policy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"s3:PutObject"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"s3:ListBucket"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also, in order to allow others to access your S3 files with the generated URL, you need to set up the CORS policy in the permission tab of your S3 Bucket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CORS policy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"AllowedMethods"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"PUT"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"POST"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, it's ready to access S3 from the code base and upload files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#upload-file-in-javascript-code-base"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Upload File In Javascript Code Base
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you received the AWS access key and secret key, you can store them with AWS region info and bucket name in the .env file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, please make sure that you installed aws-sdk in your project.&lt;br&gt;
To install aws-sdk, you can simply use npm package manager to do below.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;aws-sdk
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And here is the simple code to generate the upload URL.&lt;br&gt;
First, you need to create S3 bucket object.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;s3bucket&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;S3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;accessKeyId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;AWS_ACCESS_KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;secretAccessKey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;AWS_SECRET_KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;signatureVersion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;v4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;region&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;AWS_REGION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ex) us-west-2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And then, use &lt;code&gt;getSignedUrlPromise()&lt;/code&gt; to receive the generated upload URL.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;Bucket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;AWS_BUCKET_NAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;Expires&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// expire time in second&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// this key is the S3 full file path (ex: mnt/sample.txt)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// notice that this is the same method that we used for downloading, &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// but using 'putObject' instead of 'getObject'&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;s3bucket&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getSignedUrlPromise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;putObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once, you received the URL, you can use the HTTP request module (in my case, I used axios) to upload the file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// create read stream with file's full path including file name and extension&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;istream&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createReadStream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;streamPath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// using generated uploading url to upload file&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;axios&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;put&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;istream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Content-Type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mimetype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// mime type of the file&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Content-Length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;totalSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// file's total size&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;http upload success!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;with the read stream object, you can follow events with &lt;code&gt;.on()&lt;/code&gt; function. The events that you may be interested in during the upload are &lt;code&gt;close&lt;/code&gt; (when the stream is finished, meaning upload is done), &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt;(sending data chunk - upload process), and &lt;code&gt;error&lt;/code&gt; (when failed to upload).&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/helenanders26/sql-database-monthly-wrap-up-june-2021-4344</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi! I'm Helen, one of your friendly mods looking after the #sql, #postgres, #mysql, and #database tags. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of each month, I'll be showcasing some of the great posts, projects, and insights from the data community. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;To get us started we have &lt;a href="https://dev.to/kgilpin"&gt;Kevin&lt;/a&gt; from the AppLand team with a RailsConf presentation and demo on how to auto-document database schemas with a gem called rails-erd.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;div class="ltag__link"&gt;

      04:08&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Next, we have &lt;a href="https://dev.to/lordghostx"&gt;LordGhostX&lt;/a&gt; with a post showing how by integrating HarperDB with Python and Flask, we can build a contact manager with CRUD functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/ishakmohmed"&gt;Mohmed&lt;/a&gt; then shares some of the most important tips you need when you're building relational databases like MySQL, and PostgreSQL.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Moving on to &lt;a href="https://dev.to/curiouspaul1"&gt;Curious Paul&lt;/a&gt; and their post on how to build a telegram bot using a database on Fauna’s serverless system to host user data.&lt;/p&gt;

Each data architecture model has benefits and shortcomings, there is no good and bad approach. This post evaluates how these data architecture patterns can be applied using great examples.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Heat Map - An Alternate Option To Response Time Scatter Plot</title>
      <author>Harinder Seera 🇭🇲</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 26 Jun 2021 09:53:52 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/hseera/heat-map-an-alternate-option-to-response-time-scatter-plot-525k</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/hseera/heat-map-an-alternate-option-to-response-time-scatter-plot-525k</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Response time is crucial to understanding system behavior. It is also one of the metrics commonly reported by performance test tools. Yet common presentations of this metric can hide important details and patterns, just like the graph below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3V3j_XLE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7vi2390188njagdafu9y.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3V3j_XLE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7vi2390188njagdafu9y.png" alt="linechart"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is critical that you have raw data for further analysis, as and when needed. It is also important that you select the right chart to represent the raw data. Use chart(s) that will help highlight patterns missed by basic representation (i.e. average response time graph).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience, the most common choice of chart to display individual data points is the scatter plot. Below is an example of using the scatter plot to display the individual response times for a test run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gc7uoBAO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yriydjca3elqauvuwad8.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gc7uoBAO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yriydjca3elqauvuwad8.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scatter plot is good for displaying individual data. However, there are times when displaying a large amount of data using the scatter plot can overwhelm your visual senses. Just like the chart above. There is too much information to dissect from it. Because of the sheer amount of data, some patterns are not visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I want to introduce you to another alternative to the scatter plot and that is the heat map. The heat map can still highlight similar outliers, distribution modes, and other details without plotting every individual data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heat map buckets data that fall into the same range and then use colors to highlight the intensity/volume of data in each bucket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is an example from a test run where the heat map was used instead of the scatter plot. The first graph is the common way of representing the transaction response time (average response time graph). The second is the heat map showing the response time distribution and patterns not captured by the first graph. It was still able to highlight similar patterns that scatter plot would have but with fewer data points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iZ4hyX8p--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g51zvn02gbxg8n3t596w.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iZ4hyX8p--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g51zvn02gbxg8n3t596w.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In above example, the more the number of data points fall in the same response time bucket, the darker the shade of red. And if the count is less than it is represented by a shade of green.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example where the heat map was used to complement the common response time graph. It shows a different pattern that is not visible in the primary graph. Again scatter plot would have done the trick but there would have been too much information on the chart. Using the heat map helped reduced the noise without compromising the data integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9lR01SSF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/64lnjvea07go4hy7h0m5.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9lR01SSF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/64lnjvea07go4hy7h0m5.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like all other types of charts, using the heat map to represent response time data has its drawback too. There is no easy way to represent multiple transactions in the same heat map which is possible in the scatter plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take away points from this post are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a single transaction response time, use heat map to visualize individual data point over scatter plot. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure you select the right chart to display the data without overwhelming the visual senses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most common way of presenting the response time data may hide patterns and details which are only visible when you use different way to present it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you are wondering which tool I am using, it is the &lt;a href="https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/panels/visualizations/heatmap/"&gt;heat map plugin&lt;/a&gt; for Grafana.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have some dignity, you should know what Fibonacci numbers are. But if you don't know, the Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;span class="katex-element"&gt;
  &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;F1=F2=1
F_1 = F_2 = 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;F&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mrel"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;F&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mrel"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;span class="katex-element"&gt;
  &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;Fn=Fn−1+Fn−2
F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;F&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mrel"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;F&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mbin mtight"&gt;−&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mbin"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;F&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mbin mtight"&gt;−&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the first 6 Fibonacci numbers are: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would like to write an algorithm that finds the n'th Fibonacci number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#simple-amp-inefficient"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Simple &amp;amp; Inefficient
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most famous solutions to this problem is obviously recursive.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;fib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A quick calculation proves that the time complexity is 
&lt;span class="katex-element"&gt;
  &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;O(2n)O(2^n)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mopen"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mclose"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
, which is the worst of our nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#simple-amp-efficient"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Simple &amp;amp; Efficient
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another well known solution is to use a simple for loop.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;fib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is a great solution since it is relatively simple and efficient, as it run in 
&lt;span class="katex-element"&gt;
  &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;O(n)O(n)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mopen"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mclose"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But&lt;/strong&gt;, can we do better?&lt;br&gt;
Yes we can!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-brilliancy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Brilliancy
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is for the algo-holics and thanks to its simplicity and efficiency, I consider it to be a brilliant solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to find the n'th Fibonacci number in 
&lt;span class="katex-element"&gt;
  &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;O(log(n))O(log(n))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mopen"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mopen"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mclose"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For starters, let's see how we can calculate 
&lt;span class="katex-element"&gt;
  &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;xnx^n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
 in an efficient time complexity of 
&lt;span class="katex-element"&gt;
  &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;O(log(n))O(log(n))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mopen"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mopen"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mclose"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
This algorithm is based on the fact that:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just for make sure, let's calculate this matrix multiplication:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="katex-element"&gt;

\bigg( {1 \atop 1} {1 \atop 0} \bigg)\bigg( {F_{n-1} \atop F_{n-2}} \bigg) = \bigg( {F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \atop F_{n-1}} \bigg) = \bigg( {F_{n} \atop F_{n-1}} \bigg)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="delimsizing

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Since this is right for every

  &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;n&amp;gt;2n &amp;gt; 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mrel"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
, we can claim that:&lt;/p&gt;

class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="delimsizing size3"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mopen

class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span

class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mopen nulldelimiter"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mfrac"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span

class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mclose

class="vlist-t"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mbin mtight"&gt;−&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="delimsizing size3"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mopen nulldelimiter"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mfrac"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mclose nulldelimiter"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="delimsizing size3"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So now, we see that if we want to know the nth Fibonacci number (and the one before), all we have to do is some matrix multiplication! More specifically, we need to raise a matrix to the power of 
&lt;span class="katex-element"&gt;
  &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;n−2n-2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mbin"&gt;−&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
. But we already know how to calculate 
&lt;span class="katex-element"&gt;
  &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;pow(x,n)pow(x, n)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;w&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mopen"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mpunct"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mclose"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
 in 
&lt;span class="katex-element"&gt;
  &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;O(log(n))O(log(n))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mopen"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mopen"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mclose"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
. This is amazingggg! Note that every matrix multiplication is 
&lt;span class="katex-element"&gt;
  &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;O(1)O(1)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mopen"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mclose"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, suppose we adjust our power algorithm to work with matrix multiplication instead of regular multiplication, we can calculate 
&lt;span class="katex-element"&gt;
  &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;(1110)n−2{\big( {1 \atop 1} {1 \atop 0} \big)}^{n-2}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="delimsizing size1"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mopen nulldelimiter"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mfrac"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mclose nulldelimiter"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mopen nulldelimiter"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mfrac"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mclose nulldelimiter"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="delimsizing size1"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mbin mtight"&gt;−&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
 in 
&lt;span class="katex-element"&gt;
  &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;O(log(n))O(log(n))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mopen"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mopen"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mclose"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
, then multiply it by 
&lt;span class="katex-element"&gt;
  &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;(11)\big( {1 \atop 1} \big)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="delimsizing size1"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mopen nulldelimiter"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mfrac"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mclose nulldelimiter"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="delimsizing size1"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
 and &lt;strong&gt;voilà&lt;/strong&gt;! We calculated both 
&lt;span class="katex-element"&gt;
  &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;FnF_n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;F&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
 and 
&lt;span class="katex-element"&gt;
  &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;Fn−1F_{n-1}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;F&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal mtight"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mbin mtight"&gt;−&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
 in 
&lt;span class="katex-element"&gt;
  &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;O(log(n))O(log(n))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mopen"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mopen"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mclose"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a minute, let that sink in 😌.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, after you took a minute to chill out your ecstasy, think about it: Is Fibonacci special? Or this method going to work for all recursive equations like Fibonacci?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, while Fibonacci IS special, this method is going to work for all equations similar to Fibonacci. For example, let's define the Zigi sequence as follow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span class="katex-element"&gt;
  &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;Z1=7
Z_1 = 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;Z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mrel"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;span class="katex-element"&gt;
  &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;Z2=−4
Z_2 = -4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;Z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="msupsub"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pstrut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"&gt;&lt;span class="mord mtight"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-s"&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mrel"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mspace"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;−&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;span class="katex-element"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The secret is simple: Just find the correct matrix, and the magic will come. Here, we can see that:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="katex-element"&gt;

\bigg( {Z_{n} \atop Z_{n-1}} \bigg) = \bigg( {2 \atop 1} {-3 \atop 0} \bigg)\bigg( {Z_{n-1} \atop Z_{n-2}} \bigg)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="delimsizing size3"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mord"&gt;&lt;span class="mopen nulldelimiter"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mfrac"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist-t

class="vlist-r"&gt;&lt;span class="vlist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And, as you see, the n'th Zigi's number can be computed in 
&lt;span class="katex-element"&gt;
  &lt;span class="katex"&gt;&lt;span class="katex-mathml"&gt;O(log(n))O(log(n))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="katex-html"&gt;&lt;span class="base"&gt;&lt;span class="strut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mopen"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mopen"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mord mathnormal"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mclose"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to use interactive rebase in git</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started my first professional job as a front-end developer a few months ago. It was both scary and thrilling. During that time, I learnt a lot of things and encountered a lot of problems, but one thing that really threw me off was git rebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was my first time using git rebase in any capacity, so I had a lot of trouble getting it to work. I remember spending a whole day learning about git rebase so that I wouldn't have to ask my coworkers for help every time I needed to rebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll be sharing all I've learnt so far about git rebase with you.&lt;/p&gt;

  What is git rebase?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rebasing is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit. While it is similar to merge the difference between these two commands is that while rebasing combines all modifications made in a branch into one patch while merging takes the changes from a source branch and integrates them with a target branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#when-do-you-use-git-rebase"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  When do you use git rebase?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are a several use cases where git rebase might be used. I will go through them in detail in a short while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Edit commit messages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Remove commits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Combine commits together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#edit-commit-messages"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Edit commit messages
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you made a typo in your latest commit messages, the best way to fix that is to use git commit --amend. Git commit --amend is a git command that allows us to modify the most recent commit and we do it like&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git commit --amend -m “new commit message”
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But what if you want to change multiple commit messages or your fourth commit message?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s when git rebase comes into play. Rebasing intervactively allows us to alter individual commits and to do so you type the following command in your terminal &lt;code&gt;git rebase -i HEAD~5&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;the -i option is what indicates that we are rebasing interactively&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;HEAD~5 indicates the number of commits you want to work with. In this case, it means that I'll be working with the last five commits I made&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pKlUjxsW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g7n1d8d7jf72oa5e3ezh.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pKlUjxsW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g7n1d8d7jf72oa5e3ezh.png" alt="List of the last five commits"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see in this image, after running &lt;code&gt;git rebase -i HEAD~5&lt;/code&gt; I get a list of the last five commits I made in this particular repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if we want to edit the third and second commit message we have to replace the pick command with the reword command then save and quit the file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the editor, you are given a list of commands that you can use while rebasing. Pick is selected as the default option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replacing &lt;code&gt;pick&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;reword&lt;/code&gt; indicates that you want to edit the commit message of that specific commit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kNNs3Zyi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uodkxj3o58tbbh9i4yc6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kNNs3Zyi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uodkxj3o58tbbh9i4yc6.png" alt="Replaced pick with reword for the second and third commit in editor"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you save and quit, you will be taken to another editor where you can edit the commit messages. If we once again run &lt;code&gt;git rebase -i HEAD~5&lt;/code&gt; this is the result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UVCSGRW8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/barzgyti3o3d26etrs82.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UVCSGRW8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/barzgyti3o3d26etrs82.png" alt="List of the last five commits with the newly edited commit messages"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You may have noticed that there are two ways to edit a commit when rebasing. Using the &lt;strong&gt;edit&lt;/strong&gt; command allows you to change both the commit message and the content of the commit while using the &lt;strong&gt;reword&lt;/strong&gt; command only allows you to change the commit message&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#remove-commits"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Remove commits
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is especially useful when you find yourself with unwanted commits in your branch (whether made by you or your colleagues). Rebasing interactively allows us to select which commit we want to remove in our branch and gives us the possibility to remove that commit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like for editing commit messages, what we need to do is to replace the &lt;code&gt;pick&lt;/code&gt; command with the &lt;code&gt;drop&lt;/code&gt; command on the commit you want to remove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YzBbcJ9e--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f8waaarm6pjylbsie5rt.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YzBbcJ9e--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f8waaarm6pjylbsie5rt.png" alt="Replaced pick with drop for the third commit in editor"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you save and quit your editor the changes will be applied and that commit will be removed along with all changes that had been made on that commit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now instead of running the command &lt;code&gt;git rebase -i HEAD~5&lt;/code&gt; you'll run &lt;code&gt;git rebase -i HEAD~4&lt;/code&gt; as you have remove one commit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---z4-x5a3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q0iqelfp0aps1a4s3n58.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---z4-x5a3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q0iqelfp0aps1a4s3n58.png" alt="List of the last four commits with the removed"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see we have removed the third commit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Be careful when using drop so as to not lose important changes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#combine-commits-together"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Combine commits together
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next would be the &lt;code&gt;squash&lt;/code&gt; command. The &lt;code&gt;squash&lt;/code&gt; command allows us to combine two or more commits into one commit and write a new commit message to describe the new commit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll replace the &lt;code&gt;pick&lt;/code&gt; command with the &lt;code&gt;squash&lt;/code&gt; command on the commit you want to combine into the previous one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--T9znsLS9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n6w6jhe09u19n66cxix3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--T9znsLS9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n6w6jhe09u19n66cxix3.png" alt="Replaced pick command with squash on the second and fourth commit"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we save and quit, the second and fourth commit will be merge into the first commit. When you are squashing you're commits together, you merge the latest commits into the older commit which is why it is important to remember that our commits will be squashed from bottom to top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--16-m0t6w--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cy4g8mbdjkz7pu7zisex.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--16-m0t6w--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cy4g8mbdjkz7pu7zisex.png" alt="New editor that allows us to change the commit message of the first, second, and fourth commit."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you use the squash command, you are given the option to edit the commit messages of the commits you want to squash together. If you want to use only one commit message, you can go ahead and comment the commit messages you don't want and remain with the commit message you want to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;code&gt;fixup&lt;/code&gt; command works like the &lt;code&gt;squash&lt;/code&gt; command, the only difference is that the &lt;code&gt;fixup&lt;/code&gt; command will discard the commit message of the latest commit and remain with the commit message of the commit message of the commit they'll be merged into&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#next-step"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Next step
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the next step would be to push your commits to a remote branch. One thing to keep in mind is that you have rewritten you branch history by using git rebase so if the branch is already published you will have to force push the new changes by using&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git push --force origin name-of-the-branch-you-are-working-on
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using force push can cause problems for anyone else working on the branch so unless you are the only one work on that particular branch, it is safer to first check with your colleagues working on that branch before proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is it! While this article doesn't cover everything there is to know about interactive rebase in git, it should be enough to get your started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leave a comment and share it with your friends if you find it useful and let me know if you want me to cover any topic related to git or front-end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay safe and thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Azure Certifications - Where to start and how to prepare?</title>
      <author>Abhinav Pandey</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 26 Jun 2021 09:44:22 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/abh1navv/azure-certifications-where-to-start-and-how-to-prepare-183</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/abh1navv/azure-certifications-where-to-start-and-how-to-prepare-183</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, cloud solutions have been on a boom in the industry. As a result, many of us have been learning and getting certified in cloud solutions. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/6f78f53b753536048f99cabf6a44c3876f7cb975183da8623970e89ac98bbf16/68747470733a2f2f63646e2e6472696262626c652e636f6d2f75736572732f333834373436352f73637265656e73686f74732f31303736353132352f6d656469612f65356630383335336265353935326335626664346137353939303364356335612e676966" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/6f78f53b753536048f99cabf6a44c3876f7cb975183da8623970e89ac98bbf16/68747470733a2f2f63646e2e6472696262626c652e636f6d2f75736572732f333834373436352f73637265656e73686f74732f31303736353132352f6d656469612f65356630383335336265353935326335626664346137353939303364356335612e676966" alt="Azure"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Microsoft Azure is one such giant in the cloud market with a variety of relevant certifications available for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I'm going to help you understand the need for these cloud certifications (or at least the preparation involved with them) and help you choose your certification path on Azure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#roles"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Roles
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The certifications can be broadly classified into 3 roles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Innovation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data and Analytics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the full certification chart &lt;a href="https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4wyqh"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#where-should-we-start"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Where should we start?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will want to start with one of the fundamentals courses. There are 3 of them to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#azure-fundamentals-az900"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most appropriate starting point of your Azure journey. &lt;br&gt;
It teaches you the different fundamental aspects of cloud computing and then goes ahead to introduce different services on Azure - Security, Storage, Databases, Virtual Machines, Containers, Cost, Administration, AI, Management. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sounds a lot?&lt;/em&gt; - Don't worry! The purpose is to make you aware about &lt;strong&gt;which service to use when&lt;/strong&gt;. The exam will &lt;strong&gt;not test you on how to use them&lt;/strong&gt;. If you take this path, you will be better equipped to understand all facets of complete cloud solutions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who should take it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyone getting started with Azure (&amp;lt;1 years of experience)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People of all roles - Managers, Solution Architects, Developers, System Administrators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Startups looking to explore cloud deployment options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If certifications are sponsored for you by your organization, don't miss this one. This is a must have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who may not take it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People who have been working on Azure for a long time and have developed projects on it may rather start with an Associate level certification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People who work only in Data/AI domain should rather go for Azure Data/AI Fundamentals and not worry about learning a large number of services they are unlikely use. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to prepare?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Option 1 - &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900"&gt;Microsoft Learn&lt;/a&gt; platform provides learning resources which are &lt;strong&gt;Free and enough&lt;/strong&gt; to learn all that can be asked in the exam. To give you a little hands-on, it will occasionally provide you a sandbox to perform guided exercises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Option 2 - If Microsoft Learn seems boring to you, opt for video courses. You can find some free ones on Youtube as well. Go for the one which suits you. Do check reviews. For expert courses, you can check other learning platforms like O'reilly or Udemy. This is a very popular certification and there are abundant resources to learn from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mandatory - Practice tests are very important before taking any exam. Your preparation is not complete without them so please find yourself some practice tests before appearing in the final exam. What I used is &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/az-900-practice-tests/"&gt;this Udemy course&lt;/a&gt; but you may find your own option.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#azure-data-fundamentals-dp900"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Azure Data Fundamentals (DP-900)
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/xT9C25UNTwfZuk85WP/source.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/xT9C25UNTwfZuk85WP/source.gif" alt="Data"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Smaller scope. Only concerned with Data related services - Relational databases, NoSQL Databases and Big data analytics services. Introduces you to fundamental database concepts and gives you an overview of which Azure service is right in certain use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who should take it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People who work with data capabilities but are new to Azure - database administrators, data scientists and data analysts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software developers who are new to Azure - as developers we will usually work with different data sources in our applications. This path will give you an insight into Azure data services. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beginners trying to understand data concepts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyone exploring database migration to Azure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who may not take it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experienced developers, specially those with data capabilities, should skip this one and start with associate level certifications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developers who took AZ-900 may skip this one as there is a certain overlap. It may still be beneficial to go through the learning path.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to prepare?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mandatory - &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/dp-900"&gt;Microsoft Learn&lt;/a&gt;. The learning paths are short, free and enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A little less mandatory - Practice tests. E.g. &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/dp-900-azure-data-fundamentals-5-practice-tests/"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;. You may look at other websites for free tests. Just make sure that they were updated after 23rd April 2021.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optional - Video courses. Can be overkill but if you're paying for the exam, why not go overprepared. Here's &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3qmqUZJ7l0&amp;amp;ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org"&gt;a free course by our favorite learning channel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro tip&lt;/strong&gt;: The video course is enough if you just want to learn. DP-900 is not an in-demand certification. Not worth $99.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#azure-ai-fundamentals-ai900"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Azure AI Fundamentals (AI-900)
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/pw2fLKLW3mgw/source.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/pw2fLKLW3mgw/source.gif" alt="AI"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Introduces you to Azure AI services like  Bots, Machine Learning, NLP and Computer Vision. No AI knowledge is required to understand it. Azure AI services are fully functional APIs and we are not developing anything from scratch. What we need to focus on is where to use them in our product.  &lt;strong&gt;Very interesting to learn and easy to pass.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who should take it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People who work with AI capabilities but are new to Azure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software developers who do not want to go deep into Azure AI services - Azure AI Engineer and Developer paths are very much relevant for each other. People pursuing developer certifications should also pursue AI certifications (or at least learn).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are not into AI presently, this is a perfect place to start. This is also a great path for non-technical people - e.g. product owners and business analysts - because it helps you explore AI possibilities for your products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Startups and developers exploring cost efficient AI services for their products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who may not take it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are experienced (&amp;gt; 6 months) in using multiple Azure AI services, skip this one and go for Azure AI Engineer certification. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can also skip this if you have done AZ-900 and plan to go for Azure AI Engineer in mid-term future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Definitely skip it if you are not from "Innovation" role.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to prepare?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mandatory - &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/ai-900"&gt;Microsoft Learn&lt;/a&gt;. The learning paths are short, free and enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mandatory - Practice tests. E.g. &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/microsoft-certified-azure-ai-fundamentals-5-practice-tests/"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;. You may look at other websites for free tests. Just make sure that they were updated after 23rd April 2021.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optional - Video courses. It will be good to explore courses which provide you hands-on examples specially if you're not doing hands-on practice yourself. Although the exam will not ask you how and focus on why, it will be much easier for you to understand by doing or watching someone do it. Here's &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwZHNH8EfSU"&gt;a free course by our favorite learning channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you have enjoyed this peek into Azure Fundamental certifications and looking forward to learning more about Azure services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Misc notes&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Cost&lt;/strong&gt; - I have taken all 3 certifications because the exams were free for me. Each of them normally cost around $99(lower in certain countries). For anyone with cost concerns, I recommend only AZ-900 in general and AI-900 for people exploring AI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Learning resources&lt;/strong&gt; - I used a few Udemy examples above. This is because I have a Udemy for Business account. If your organization provides that, Udemy is the best place to learn software development skills. Best free alternative is YouTube (obviously).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Azure vs AWS&lt;/strong&gt; - The reasons I chose Azure over AWS are: 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I already have experience working with Azure (started in 2019). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The learning material on Microsoft Learn is excellent compared to AWS learning portal which does not have well organized content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Azure terminology is very easy to understand for beginners - E.g. Virtual machines are called Virtual machines and not Elastic Compute Cloud (:p).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a very good reason to choose AWS - It has a 1.5x market share compared to Azure which means more job opportunities in AWS. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gd8JDnTg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://www.cloudmanagementinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/AWS-vs-Azure-Service-wise-Gif-06.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gd8JDnTg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://www.cloudmanagementinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/AWS-vs-Azure-Service-wise-Gif-06.gif" alt="Azure vs AWS"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for more on Azure certifications. In the next post, I will talk about the "Innovation" role and explore the certification journey that software developers should follow.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/sidthedev/can-we-add-custom-emojis-to-dev-to-4g1d</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am celebrating pride month.&lt;br&gt;
But its a shame that there are no emojis other than the rainbow flag and the trans flag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be beyond cool if dev could have custom pride emojis, such as bipride or panpride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is proof on discord how good the emojis would look if added to dev.to&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qwsh5-Gh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qwmntpdex4paxwjyjrqi.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qwsh5-Gh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qwmntpdex4paxwjyjrqi.jpeg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks. &lt;a class="mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/ben"&gt;@ben&lt;/a&gt;
 what's your take on this?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Architecting HTTP client in Vue js (Nuxt js)</title>
      <author>Hossein Molavi</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 26 Jun 2021 09:32:33 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/ho3einmolavi/architecting-http-client-in-vue-js-nuxt-js-ig</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/ho3einmolavi/architecting-http-client-in-vue-js-nuxt-js-ig</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article, I want to talk about the backend APIs and how to manage them in our app.&lt;br&gt;
First of all, we have to choose the modules in such a way that we chose our models.&lt;br&gt;
Let me explain:&lt;br&gt;
Assume that you have two data models, User, and Book.&lt;br&gt;
Each of the User and Book models has its own API, Like registering a user or buying a book.&lt;br&gt;
So we have to encapsulate each API for a specific model.&lt;br&gt;
Let’s get started&lt;br&gt;
In our Nuxt app create a folder named API (or whatever you comfortable with)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.Creating HTTP Clients using Axios instances&lt;br&gt;
2.Structuring your API endpoints&lt;br&gt;
3.Making network requests inside Vuex actions&lt;br&gt;
4.Handling network errors&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axios provides out of the box support for having a persistent configuration for all of our API calls using Axios instances. We’ll be using Axios instances as HTTP clients in our application with our configurations. If you are working on a large-scale application, it is possible that your application needs to communicate with different API endpoints. In this case, we might need to create multiple Axios instances, with their own configuration and separate them out to individual files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install Axios in your project&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ npm install --save axios&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always consider best prictices. it is recommended to add API URLs into .env file&lt;br&gt;
In .env file in the nuxt app we must add NUXT to variables. For example: NUXT_ENV_BASE_URL=&lt;a href="https://api.myapp.test"&gt;https://api.myapp.test&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/configuration-glossary/configuration-env"&gt;read the documents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we have our environment variables in place, we can retrieve them while creating axios instances. We can additionally pass all our configuration into this instance, including headers, and use this instance to create HTTP requests.&lt;br&gt;
let’s create our http client instance in httpclient.js placed in API folder.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import axios from 'axios';

const httpClient = axios.create({
  baseURL: process.env.baseUrl,
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    // anything you want to add to the headers
  }
});

export default httpClient;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#structuring-your-api-endpoints"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Structuring your API endpoints
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, we need ENCAPSULATION. So you should create a folder named user in the API folder and add the users.api.js file inside it.&lt;br&gt;
in users.api.js:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import httpClient from '../httpclient';


export const login = ({username, password}) =&amp;gt; {
  return httpClient({
    url: '/login',
    method: 'post',
    headers: {
      // "X-CSRF-TOKEN": getCookie('csrf_token')
    },
    data: {
      username, password
    }
  });
}

export const register = ({username, password}) =&amp;gt; {
  return httpClient({
    url: '/register',
    method: 'post',
    headers: {
      // "X-CSRF-TOKEN": getCookie('csrf_token')
    },
    data: {
      username, password
    }
  });
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can follow a simple directory structure for storing all these files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;api/&lt;br&gt;
 ├── httpClient.js  --&amp;gt; HTTP Client with our configs&lt;br&gt;
 ├── users&lt;br&gt;
       ├──── users.api.js&lt;br&gt;
 ├── books&lt;br&gt;
       ├──── books.api.js&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we can use them in our Vue.js components and Vuex store by simply importing them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import { login, register } from '@/api/users/users.api';
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Making network requests inside Vuex actions
Move all the business login into Vuex store, including network requests makes the view components independent. Use actions to fetch data and store them in state using mutations. (Don’t change states in actions directly)
actions are synchronous by default, but you can use Promises or async to check if the action is complete or not. (please try to split modules in Vuex store as well as the APIs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;/*
*   store/modules/users/users.module.js
*/
import {register, login} from "~/api/users/users.api";

export const state = () =&amp;gt; ({
  user: null,
  csrf_token: null
})

export const getters = {
  get_user(state) {
    return state.user
  },
}
export const mutations = {
  SET_USER_INFO(state, user) {
    state.user = user
  },
}
export const actions = {
  loginUser({store, commit}, {username, password}) {
  return new Promise(async (resolve, reject) =&amp;gt; {
    try {
      const response = await login({
        username, password
      });
      //depends on the response
      commit('SET_USER_INFO', response.data) 
      resolve()
    } catch (err) {
      reject(err.response.data.message)
      console.log(err)
    }
  })
}
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#handling-network-errors-and-logging"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Handling network errors and logging
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it easy as response.status === 500 in every request? It's not ideal to check the status and logging these errors in every network request we make inside our actions. Instead, axios offer abilities to intercept the error responses, which is a perfect spot to find errors, log or show a cute notification to the user saying the server effed up. We can also use this to log-out the user from your application if the requests aren't authorized or if the server informs of an expired session.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import axios from 'axios';

const httpClient = axios.create({
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  }
})

// interceptor to catch errors
const errorInterceptor = error =&amp;gt; {
  // check if it's a server error
  if (!error.response) {
    return Promise.reject(error);
  }

  // all the other error responses
  switch (error.response.status) {

    case 401: // authentication error, logout the user
      localStorage.removeItem('auth_token');
      stop();
      location.href = '/auth/login';
      break;

    default:
  }
  return Promise.reject(error);
}

// Interceptor for responses
const responseInterceptor = response =&amp;gt; {
  switch (response.status) {
    case 200:
      // yay!
      break;
    // any other cases
    default:
    // default case
  }

  return response;
}

httpClient.interceptors.response.use(responseInterceptor, errorInterceptor);

export default httpClient;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is an example of how you can manage errors. (there are several ways to do that).&lt;br&gt;
That’s it. if you follow this architecture for implementing your client API, you can scale it very easy, Also your codes become maintainable and it’s a very important point, especially for big projects.&lt;/p&gt;
