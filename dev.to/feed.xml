      <guid>https://dev.to/shriekdj/lets-install-heroku-cli-on-termux-an-android-app-19hb</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I Tried To Install Heroku CLI On Termux But It Does Not Worked i Tried To Install Nodejs First For Building The Heroku CLI From Built but It Does Not Work At All.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;apt install heroku&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
does not work said heroku not available&lt;br&gt;
snapd package also unable to install on termux.&lt;br&gt;
and also when tried same error&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;npm install heroku&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
it shows error &lt;em&gt;sudo&lt;/em&gt; permissions need&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Last This Last Commands Worked&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;apt-get &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;proot-distro

proot-distro &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;ubuntu

proot-distro login ubuntu

apt-get &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;curl

curl https://cli-assets.heroku.com/install-ubuntu.sh | sh
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You Can Run Ubuntu and Also Other Distro Like ArchLinux, Fedora, OpenSuse, etc.,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I Know It Is Not A Good Practice to Install these Things On Android Mobile But termux also works on Android Television.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You Can Use Your Android TV As Backup Linux Machine think About It.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How Can You Get Noticed Without a Github Account?</title>
      <author>Fernando Doglio</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2021 11:47:14 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/deleteman123/how-can-you-get-noticed-without-a-github-account-2h1h</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/deleteman123/how-can-you-get-noticed-without-a-github-account-2h1h</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve had conversations with many developers trying to understand how to get their first job without any experience. And my go-to solution is: create a Github account and start uploading code projects you’ve worked on. Either that, or create new ones and publish them there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, not everyone has access to Github, given how the platform is part of Microsoft and given the latter is a US company, it needs to comply with the US export law. Thus developers from countries such as Iran, Syria, Crimea and others are blocked by the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This puts a harsh roadblock in their chances of getting their first job, especially if they’re applying for a remote position or a freelance gig. Either way, the main code repository for developers is out of their reach, so how can they find ways to show what they know how to do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at some options.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#build-a-wordpress-site"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Build a WordPress site
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, this is not a code repository, but we’re going barebone here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other public code repositories like Bitbucket are also blocked in many countries, so we’re looking for alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wordress.com allows you to set up a blog for free, where you can add whatever content you want. So let’s take a look at this and consider the opportunity it represents:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’re free to show our code however we want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’re able to provide samples of code through direct download links, or through directly showing what it looks like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can also write content around that code. Are you showing a project you built? Create a series of articles around that project and link it to the code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also take advantage of WordPress plugins such as &lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-prettify/"&gt;code-prettify&lt;/a&gt; which lets you highlight code on your posts. That way you generate a similar look and feel users would get by reading code directly on Github.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have access to hosting and a domain name (ideally something like your name .com) you can even download the free version of WordPress from Wordpress.org and install it yourself. This would give you a lot more control over how your site works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#launchpad"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  LaunchPad
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for something similar to Github but that it’s not blocked, you might want to give &lt;a href="https://launchpad.net/"&gt;LaunchPad&lt;/a&gt; a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s similar to Github in the sense that you can publish your project’s code, track bugs and issues, perform code reviews and more. And while the tutorials are written following the use of &lt;a href="http://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/bzr.dev/en/mini-tutorial/index.html"&gt;Bazaar&lt;/a&gt; instead of Git, they claim that the latter is also an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Projects such as &lt;a href="https://launchpad.net/inkscape"&gt;Inkscape&lt;/a&gt;, the Photoshop open-source alternative or &lt;a href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu-mate"&gt;Ubuntu MATE&lt;/a&gt;, the Linux distro, are hosted there and you can see the type of information that you could potentially show to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, the visual aspect is not the highlight of LaunchPad, considering they don’t allow you to show a lot, in fact, there seems to not be a place for a Readme file. However, you can definitely add a link to an external website, so that way you can provide extra information about the project if you want, and focus on giving access to your code through this platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#writing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Writing!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing is an alternative to showing projects done. It’s definitely not the same, however, as part of technical articles you can definitely show some aspects of your coding skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is what we’re after here, isn’t it? Trying to show potential employees that you know what you’re talking about and that the list of skills on your resume is definitely true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing in a lot of places is free and public, so you don’t need to spend any money if you don’t want to. And if you’re doing this for a resume, I would strongly suggest you write about the subjects you claim to know. Maybe not about all of them, but the most relevant at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re lucky and some of those articles get some traction, they can even be picked up by newsletters such as &lt;a href="https://javascriptweekly.com/"&gt;JavaScriptWeekly&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a nice greeting card, especially if your interviewer is already a subscriber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even if you’re just getting started, spend some time honing your writing skills, their return of investment is huge considering how much they can affect your communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#go-to-meetups-conferences-and-speak"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Go to meet-ups / conferences and speak
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, this one might be a little bit extreme, but what better way to get in front of everyone you want to be hired by than assisting the same social events they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the biggest (and sometimes not so big) software companies normally either sponsor some meet-ups or the big conferences, and they tend to send some of their employees as well. It’s a great opportunity for you to be there, speak about something relevant to your experience and network!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that it’s not easy for everyone. Especially conferences require travel and not all of them are willing to pay for your plane ticket and hotel room. But at least do the research, there is a ton of information online about the different conferences you could be speaking at and they normally tell you if they have some travel budget or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about it, it might sound like a lot, but you’re also putting your name out there. The video of your talk will surely be on YouTube a little bit after, and anybody interested in you will only have to google your name. This is definitely a powerful, yet scary, opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not discard it until you’ve done the research.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Getting noticed is not all about code, but it definitely helps. The thing is that when I say “code”, you usually go straight into “side-project”, and from there you go right into Github, and that is where the plan collapses. No Github access, no side-project, no new job. Done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s not the case, find alternative ways of showing what you know how to do, either by finding less popular (or user-friendly) alternatives, or by doing other things around your projects (like writing or speaking about it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What else would you suggest to a new dev looking for their first job as an alternative to having a portfolio on Github?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Running while(true) in JS</title>
      <author>Abhishek Raj</author>

      <link>https://dev.to/abhishekraj272/running-whiletrue-in-js-1aoh</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/abhishekraj272/running-whiletrue-in-js-1aoh</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You must be wondering this guy is MAD, we can't run while/for loop &lt;strong&gt;synchronously&lt;/strong&gt; client side in &lt;em&gt;javascript&lt;/em&gt;, it will block the main thread and will FREEZE the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it is possible to run it but not a good way to do it and might introduce some bugs in your program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#web-worker"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Web Worker
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web Worker runs in a single thread isolated from the main thread, so you can run any synchronous operation without blocking the thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can run the loop in Web Worker and send the send the data from Web Worker to Main Thread using &lt;em&gt;postMessage&lt;/em&gt; method. It will run as good as main thread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can try it in the below code snippet&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/abhishekraj272/embed/WNZjWMe?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result,js&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Running synchronous loop is not advised in browser, unless there is a such requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Logistic Regression</title>
      <author>Swayam Singh</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2021 11:36:11 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/_s_w_a_y_a_m_/logistic-regression-li9</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/_s_w_a_y_a_m_/logistic-regression-li9</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#overview"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Overview
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; article of the &lt;a href="https://swayam-blog.hashnode.dev/series/demystifying-ml"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demystifying Machine Learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; series. In this article, we are going to discuss a supervised classification algorithm &lt;strong&gt;Logistic Regression&lt;/strong&gt;, how it works, why it's important, mathematics behind the scenes, linear and non-linear separation and Regularization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good grasp of Linear Regression is needed to understand this algorithm and luckily we already covered it, for reference you can read it from &lt;a href="https://swayam-blog.hashnode.dev/linear-regression-using-gradient-descent"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Logistic Regression&lt;/strong&gt; builds the base of &lt;strong&gt;Neural Networks&lt;/strong&gt;,  so it gets very important to understand the terms and working of this algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistic Regression&lt;/strong&gt; is not a regression algorithm, its name does consist of the word "Regression" but it's a classification algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-logistic-regression"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Logistic Regression?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistic Regression&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;also known as Perceptron algorithm is a supervised classification algorithm i.e. we teach our hypothesis with categorical labelled data and it predicts the classes (or categories) with some certain probability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.  The reason this algorithm is called Logistic Regression is maybe that it's working is pretty similar to that of Linear Regression and the term "Logistic" is because we use a Logistic function in this algorithm (&lt;em&gt;we'll going to see it later&lt;/em&gt;). The difference is that with Linear Regression we intend to predict the continuous values but with Logistic Regression we want to predict the categorical value. Like whether the student gets enrolled in a university or not, if the picture contains a cat or not, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a representation of how Logistic Regression classifies the data points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Kef-WziO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639752060348/CzQh-pR6T.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Kef-WziO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639752060348/CzQh-pR6T.png" alt="1.png" width="640" height="480"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see that the &lt;em&gt;blue points&lt;/em&gt; are separated from the &lt;em&gt;orange points&lt;/em&gt; through a line and we call this line a &lt;strong&gt;decision boundary&lt;/strong&gt;. Basically, with Logistic Regression we separate the classes (or categories) with the help of decision boundaries, they can be linear or non-linear. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#working-of-logistic-regression"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Working of Logistic Regression
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's revise what we learnt in &lt;a href="https://swayam-blog.hashnode.dev/linear-regression-using-gradient-descent"&gt;Linear Regression&lt;/a&gt;, we initialise the parameters with all 0s, then with the help of Gradient Descent calculate the optimal parameters by reducing the cost function and lastly draw the hypothesis to predict the continuous-valued target. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here we don't need continuous values, instead, we want to output the probability that lies between [0,1]. So the question arises, &lt;strong&gt;how we can get probability or a number between [0,1] from the continuous values of Linear Regression?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sigmoid-function"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Sigmoid function
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sigmoid function&lt;/strong&gt; is a type of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;logistic function&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; which takes a real number as input and gives out a real number between [0,1] as output. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TPac8HFh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639756326745/bI7AUi4gX.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TPac8HFh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639756326745/bI7AUi4gX.png" alt="1.png" width="880" height="90"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--c6-acedH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639752080151/XSs-lCUma.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--c6-acedH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639752080151/XSs-lCUma.png" alt="2.png" width="880" height="527"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So basically we'll generate the continuous values using Linear Regression and convert those continuous values into probability i.e. between [0,1] by passing through &lt;strong&gt;sigmoid function&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pmGjnM5B--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639756341261/wJM47_tPB.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pmGjnM5B--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639756341261/wJM47_tPB.png" alt="2.png" width="880" height="106"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in the end our final hypothesis will look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qf10WZCQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639756529024/Hsdngqks9.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qf10WZCQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639756529024/Hsdngqks9.png" alt="3.png" width="880" height="118"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This hypothesis is different from the hypothesis of Linear Regression. Yeah looks fair enough, let me give you a visualisation about overall how Logistic Regression works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vCX7SFsd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639752100559/4t7OW4zk5.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vCX7SFsd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639752100559/4t7OW4zk5.png" alt="13.png" width="880" height="660"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:- X0 is basically 1, we will it later why?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it's very clear from the above representation that the part behind the &lt;code&gt;sigmoid&lt;/code&gt; function is very similar to that of Linear Regression. Let's now move ahead and define the cost function for Logistic Regression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cost-function"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cost function
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our hypothesis is different from that of Linear Regression, so we need to define a new cost function. We already learnt in our &lt;a href="https://swayam-blog.hashnode.dev/linear-regression-using-gradient-descent"&gt;2nd article&lt;/a&gt; about what is cost function is and how to define one for our algorithm. Let's use those concepts and define one for Logistic Regression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For simplicity let's consider the case of binary classification which means our target value will be either 1(True) or 0(False). For example, the image contains a cat (1, True) or the image does not contain a cat (0, False). This means that our predicted values will also be either 0 or 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me first show you what is the cost function for Logistic Regression and then we'll try to understand its derivation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bw9jlVEV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639756571823/yAX5pAFqL.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bw9jlVEV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639756571823/yAX5pAFqL.png" alt="4.png" width="880" height="100"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combining both the conditions and taking their mean for &lt;strong&gt;m&lt;/strong&gt; samples in a dataset:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wySl1UBN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639756596078/c2xN6n22Z.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wySl1UBN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639756596078/c2xN6n22Z.png" alt="5.png" width="880" height="100"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The equation shown above is of the cost function for Logistic Regression and it looks very different than that of Linear Regression, let's break it down and understand how we came up with the above cost function? Get ready, probability class is about to begin...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RsjKG7ZM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639756622846/xcBIW7ru-.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RsjKG7ZM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639756622846/xcBIW7ru-.png" alt="6.png" width="880" height="272"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a negative sign in the original cost function because when training the algorithm we want probabilities to be large but here we are representing it to minimize the cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;minimise loss =&amp;gt; max log probability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, that's a lot of maths, but it's all basics. Focus on the general form in the above equation and that's more than enough to understand how we came up with such a complex looking cost function. Let's see how to calculate the cost for &lt;strong&gt;m&lt;/strong&gt; examples for some datasets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LLFIrlby--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639756647909/EFS95vPVG.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LLFIrlby--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639756647909/EFS95vPVG.png" alt="7.png" width="880" height="347"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#gradient-descent"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Gradient Descent
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We already covered the working of gradient descent in our &lt;a href="https://swayam-blog.hashnode.dev/linear-regression-using-gradient-descent"&gt;2nd article&lt;/a&gt;, you can refer to it for revision. In this section, we'll be looking at formulas of gradients and updating the parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gradient of the cost is a vector of the same length as θ where the jth parameter (for j=0,1,⋯,n) is defined as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---kAGMKI_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639756666029/ZE6goQy68.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---kAGMKI_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639756666029/ZE6goQy68.png" alt="8.png" width="880" height="170"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calculation of gradients from cost function is demonstrated in &lt;a href="https://swayam-blog.hashnode.dev/linear-regression-using-gradient-descent"&gt;2nd Article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we can see that the formula for calculating gradients is pretty similar to that of Linear Regression but note that the values for hθ(x&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;) are different due to the use of &lt;code&gt;sigmoid function&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After calculating gradients we can simultaneously update our parameter θ as :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JK2SrwSs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639756688657/HRoDBUBKs.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JK2SrwSs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639756688657/HRoDBUBKs.png" alt="9.png" width="880" height="145"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great now we have all the ingredients for writing our own Logistic Regression from scratch, Let's get started with it in the next section. Till now have a break for 15 minutes cause you just studied a hell of lot of maths by now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#code-implementation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Code Implementation
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section, we'll be writing our &lt;code&gt;LogisticRegression&lt;/code&gt; class using Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: You can find all the codes for this article from &lt;a href="https://swayam-blog.hashnode.dev/linear-regression-using-gradient-descent"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It's highly recommended to follow the Jupyter notebook while going through this section.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's begin 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me give you a basic overall working of this class. Firstly it'll take your &lt;em&gt;feature&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;target&lt;/em&gt; arrays as input then it'll normalize the features around mean (if you want to) and add an extra column of all 1s to your &lt;em&gt;feature&lt;/em&gt; array for the bias term, as we know from Linear Regression that &lt;code&gt;y=wx+b&lt;/code&gt;. So this &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; gets handled by this extra column of 1s with matrix multiplication of &lt;em&gt;features&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;parameters&lt;/em&gt; arrays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tcu0H1WV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639756741748/e70XrL7kZ.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tcu0H1WV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639756741748/e70XrL7kZ.png" alt="10.png" width="880" height="478"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it initializes the parameter array with all 0s after that training loop starts till the epoch count and it calculates the cost and gradient for certain parameters and simultaneously keep updating the parameters with a certain learning rate.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;LogisticRegression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;parameters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cost_history&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mu&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;sigmoid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;z&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;g&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;zeros&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This code looks pretty similar to that of Linear Regression using Gradient Descent. If you are following this series you'll be pretty familiar with this implementation. Still, I like to point out a few methods of this class:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;sigmoid&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: We added this new method to calculate the sigmoid of the continuous values generated from the linear hypothesis i.e. from θ&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;X to get the probabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;calculate_cost&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: We change the definition of this function because our cost function is changed too, it's not confusing if you are well aware of the formulas I gave and the &lt;code&gt;numpy&lt;/code&gt; library then it won't be difficult for you to understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;predict&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: This function takes the input and returns the array of predicted values 0 and 1. There's an extra parameter &lt;code&gt;threshold&lt;/code&gt; which had a default value of 0.5, if the predicted value &amp;gt; 0.5 then it'll predict 1 otherwise 0 for the predicted array. You can change this &lt;code&gt;threshold&lt;/code&gt; according to your confidence level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Trying it out on a dataset
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this sub-section, we will use our class on the dataset to check how it's working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the codes and implementations are provided in this &lt;a href="https://github.com/practice404/demystifying_machine_learning/blob/master/logistic_regression/notebook.ipynb"&gt;jupyter notebook&lt;/a&gt;, follow it for better understanding in this section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the dataset, we have records of students' marks for some Exam1 and Exam2 and the target column represents whether they get admitted into the university or not. Let's visualize it using a plot:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uuLiJiJC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639752142703/GNP0R62nW.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uuLiJiJC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639752142703/GNP0R62nW.png" alt="3.png" width="778" height="528"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what we basically want from Logistic Regression is to tell us whether a certain student with some scores of Exam1 and Exam2 is admitted or not. Let's create an instance of the &lt;code&gt;LogisticRegression&lt;/code&gt; class and try it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly I'm going to find the optimal parameters for this dataset and I'm going to show you two ways of doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using our custom class&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--C_GbZVHn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639755806863/-skmJvfk3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--C_GbZVHn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639755806863/-skmJvfk3.png" alt="4.png" width="880" height="355"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using Scipy's optimize module&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes using gradient descent takes a lot of time so for time-saving, I'll show you how you can easily find the parameters by just using &lt;code&gt;scipy.optimize.minimize&lt;/code&gt; function bypassing the cost function into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--g7V2reys--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639755824131/E1q3mdC80.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--g7V2reys--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639755824131/E1q3mdC80.png" alt="5.png" width="880" height="592"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly I appended an extra column of 1s for bias term then pass my &lt;code&gt;costFunction&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;initial_theta&lt;/code&gt;  (initially 0s) and my    &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Y&lt;/code&gt; as arguments. It easily calculated the optimal parameters in 0.3 seconds much faster than gradient descent which took about 6.5 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: &lt;code&gt;costFunction&lt;/code&gt; is similar to what we have in our class method as &lt;code&gt;calculate_cost&lt;/code&gt;, I just put it outside to show you the work of &lt;code&gt;scipy.optimize.minimize&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great now let's see how well it's performed by printing out its accuracy on the training set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kQIrEIUC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639755839852/VjGQjf-gg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kQIrEIUC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639755839852/VjGQjf-gg.png" alt="6.png" width="880" height="295"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmmm, around 89%, it seems good although there are a few algorithms that we'll be covering in future that can perform way much better than this. Now let me show you its decision boundary, as we can see that we didn't perform any polynomial transformation (for more refer to &lt;a href="https://swayam-blog.hashnode.dev/linear-regression-using-gradient-descent"&gt;article 2&lt;/a&gt;) on our input features so the decision boundary is going to be a straight line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NeicB5ZD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639755907860/N8MYuSOL9.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NeicB5ZD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639755907860/N8MYuSOL9.png" alt="7.png" width="880" height="579"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's so great we just implemented our &lt;code&gt;LogisticRegression&lt;/code&gt; class on the student's dataset. Let's move ahead and understand the problem of overfitting in the next section. Till then have a short 5-minute break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#problem-of-overfitting"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Problem of Overfitting
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to understand overfitting in Logistic Regression, I'll show you an implementation of this algorithm on another dataset where we need to fit a non-linear decision boundary. Let's visualize our 2nd dataset on the graph:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Wk-WIH5l--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639755934992/5-pXUnqBv.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Wk-WIH5l--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639755934992/5-pXUnqBv.png" alt="8.png" width="880" height="569"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we can see, it's not linearly separable data so we need to fit a non-linear decision boundary. If you went through the &lt;a href="https://swayam-blog.hashnode.dev/linear-regression-using-gradient-descent"&gt;2nd article&lt;/a&gt; of this series then you probably know how we do this, but in brief, we take our original features and apply polynomial transformations on them, like squaring, cubing or multiplying with each other to obtain new features and then training our algorithm on those new features results in non-linear classification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://github.com/practice404/demystifying_machine_learning/blob/master/logistic_regression/notebook.ipynb"&gt;notebook&lt;/a&gt; you'll find a function &lt;code&gt;mapFeature&lt;/code&gt; that take individual features as input and return new transformed features. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wanna know how it's working then consider referring to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/practice404/demystifying_machine_learning/blob/master/logistic_regression/notebook.ipynb"&gt;notebook&lt;/a&gt; and it's recommended to follow it while reading this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting the new transformed features and following the exact steps we followed in the above section, you'll be able to print out its decision boundary that will look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5iyAUtOB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639755949600/JSXj2eNSn.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5iyAUtOB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639755949600/JSXj2eNSn.png" alt="9.png" width="880" height="568"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After seeing it, you probably may say that "WOW!, it performed so well almost classified all the training points". Well, it does seem good but in reality, it's worst. Our hypothesis fitted so well on the training set that it loses the generality that means if we provide a new set of points that is not in the training set then our hypothesis will not be able to classify it clearly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, it's necessary to maintain the generality in our hypothesis so that it can perform well on the data it is never seen. &lt;strong&gt;Regularization&lt;/strong&gt; is the way to achieve it. Let's see how to maintain generality using Regularization in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#regularization"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Regularization
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section, we'll be discussing how to implement regularization. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overfitting occurs when the algorithm provides heavy parameters to some features according to the training dataset and hyperparameters. This makes those features dominant in the overall hypothesis and lead to a nice fit in the training set but not so good on the samples outside the training set.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The plan is to add the square of parameters by multiplying them with some big number (λ) to the cost function because our algorithms' main motive is to decrease the cost function, so in this way, the algorithm will end up giving the small parameters just to cancel the effect addition of parameters by multiplying with a large number (&amp;amp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;lambda;). So our final cost function gets modified to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QhWM5yOy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639756780412/aW2HU1RZv.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QhWM5yOy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639756780412/aW2HU1RZv.png" alt="11.png" width="880" height="95"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: We denote the bias term as θ0 and it's not needed to regularized the bias term that's why we are only considering only θ1 to θn parameters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since our cost function is changed that's why our formulas for gradients were also get affected. The new formula for the gradient are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Vg6YuANb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639756795932/Yh788isRU.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Vg6YuANb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639756795932/Yh788isRU.png" alt="12.png" width="880" height="167"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new formulas for gradients can be easily derived by partially differentiating the new cost function J(θ) w.r.t to some θj. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calculating of gradients from cost function is demonstrated in &lt;a href="https://swayam-blog.hashnode.dev/linear-regression-using-gradient-descent"&gt;2nd Article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;λ is known as a regularization parameter and it should be greater than 0. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Large value of λ leads to underfitting and very small values lead to overfitting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, so you need to pick the right one for your dataset through iterating on some sample values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#implementing-regularization-on-raw-logisticregression-endraw-class"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Implementing Regularization on &lt;code&gt;LogisticRegression&lt;/code&gt; class
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We only need to modify the &lt;code&gt;calculate_cost&lt;/code&gt; method because only this method is responsible for calculating both cost and gradients. The modified version is shown below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;RegLogisticRegression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;parameters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cost_history&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mu&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sigma&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;sigmoid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;z&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;g&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;zeros&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;g&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;exp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;concatenate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;axis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;threshold&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sigmoid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;parameters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now we have our regularized version of &lt;code&gt;RegLogisticRegression&lt;/code&gt; class. Let's address the previous problem of overfitting on polynomial regression by using a set of values for λ to pick the right one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yhcsvsQb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639755979522/0MXdt0T4B.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yhcsvsQb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639755979522/0MXdt0T4B.png" alt="10.png" width="880" height="251"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RUtUIEmm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639756009035/JPqLNcv2r.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RUtUIEmm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639756009035/JPqLNcv2r.png" alt="11.png" width="880" height="217"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can say that λ=1 and λ=10 looks pretty good and they both are able to maintain the generality in hypothesis, the curve is more smooth and less wiggling type. But we can see that as we keep increasing the value if λ the more our hypothesis starts to &lt;strong&gt;underfit&lt;/strong&gt; the data. It basically means that it starts to perform even worst on the training set. Let's visualise the underfitting by plotting cost functions for each λ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rRue2bZ_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639756025955/gX8nPqCOC.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rRue2bZ_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639756025955/gX8nPqCOC.png" alt="12.png" width="880" height="259"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see that as λ increases cost also increases. So it's advised to select the value for λ carefully according to your custom dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great work everyone, we successfully learnt and implemented Logistic Regression. Most people don't write their Machine Learning algorithm from scratch instead they use libraries like Scikit-Learn. Scikit-Learn contains wrappers for many Machine Learning algorithms and it's really flexible and easy to use. But it's not harmful to know about the algorithm you're going to use and the best way of doing it is to understand the underlying mathematics and implement it from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in the next article, we'll be making a classification project using the Scikit-Learn library and you'll see how easy it is to use for making some really nice creative projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you have learnt something new, for more updates on upcoming articles get connected with me through &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_s_w_a_y_a_m_"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and stay tuned for more. Till then enjoy your day and keep learning.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Backup my way</title>
      <author>Young Yoshie</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2021 11:11:56 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/youngyoshie/backup-my-way-b78</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/youngyoshie/backup-my-way-b78</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;First thing first, I want to list my own devices, which I have through the years:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laptop Samsung NP300E4Z-S06VN (Old laptop which I give to my mom)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laptop Dell Inspiron 15 3567 (My mom bought it for me when I go to college, I give it to my sister afterward)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laptop Acer Nitro AN515-45 (Gaming laptop which I buy for gaming, of course)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MacBook Pro M1 2020 (My company laptop)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phone LG G3 d851 (Kinda broken, the phone I used a long time ago)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phone Xiaomi Poco X3 NFC (Primary phone which I use daily)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;App/Service I use daily:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://bitwarden.com/"&gt;Bitwarden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://getaegis.app/"&gt;Aegis Authenticator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://rclone.org/"&gt;Rclone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://tailscale.com/"&gt;Tailscale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Keep&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Drive (I use 200GB plan)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GitLab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose is that I want my data to be safe, secure, and can be easily recovered if I lost some devices;&lt;br&gt;
or in the worst situation, I lost all.&lt;br&gt;
Because you know, it is hard to guess what is waiting for us in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 2 sections which I want to share, the first is &lt;strong&gt;How to backup&lt;/strong&gt;, the second is &lt;strong&gt;Recover strategy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-backup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to backup
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I talk about backup, I want to talk about data.&lt;br&gt;
In specifically, which data should I backup?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use Arch Linux and macOS, primarily work in the terminal so I have too many dotfiles, for example, &lt;code&gt;~/.config/nvim/init.config&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Each time I reinstall Arch Linux (I like it a lot), I need to reconfigure all the settings, and it is time-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for the DE and UI settings, I keep it as default as possible, unless it's getting in my way, I leave the default setting there and forget about it.&lt;br&gt;
The others are dotfiles, which I write my own &lt;a href="https://github.com/haunt98/dotfiles"&gt;dotfiles tool&lt;/a&gt; to backup and reconfigure easily and quickly.&lt;br&gt;
Also, I know that installing Arch Linux is not easy, despite I install it too many times (Like thousand times since I was in high school).&lt;br&gt;
Not because it is hard, but as life goes on, the &lt;a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/installation_guide"&gt;official install guide&lt;/a&gt; keeps getting new update and covering too many cases for my own personal use, so I write my own &lt;a href="https://github.com/haunt98/til/blob/main/install-archlinux.md"&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt; to quickly capture what I need to do.&lt;br&gt;
I back up all my dotfiles inside my dotfiles tool in GitHub and GitLab as I trust them both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that is my dotfiles, for my regular data, like Wallpaper or Books, Images, I use Google Drive (Actually I pay for it).&lt;br&gt;
But the step: open the webpage, click the upload button and choose files seems boring and time-consuming.&lt;br&gt;
So I use Rclone, it supports Google Drive, One Drive and many providers but I only use Google Drive for now.&lt;br&gt;
The commands are simple:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Sync from local to remote&lt;/span&gt;
rclone &lt;span class="nb"&gt;sync &lt;/span&gt;MyBooks remote:MyBooks &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-P&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--exclude&lt;/span&gt; .DS_Store

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Sync from remote to local&lt;/span&gt;
rclone &lt;span class="nb"&gt;sync &lt;/span&gt;remote:MyBooks MyBooks &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-P&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--exclude&lt;/span&gt; .DS_Store
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before you use Rclone to sync to Google Drive, you should read &lt;a href="https://rclone.org/drive/"&gt;Google Drive rclone configuration&lt;/a&gt; first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next data is my passwords and my OTPs.&lt;br&gt;
These are the things which I'm scare to lose the most.&lt;br&gt;
First thing first, I enable 2-Step Verification for all of my important accounts, should use both OTP and phone method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use Bitwarden for passwords (That is a long story, coming from Google Password manager to Firefox Lockwise and then settle down with Bitwarden) and Aegis for OTPs.&lt;br&gt;
The reason I choose Aegis, not Authy (I use Authy for so long but Aegis is definitely better) is because Aegis allows me to extract all the OTPs to a single file (Can be encrypted), which I use to transfer or backup easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as Bitwarden provides free passwords stored, I use all of its apps, extensions so that I can easily sync passwords between laptops and phones.&lt;br&gt;
The thing I need to remember is the master password of Bitwarden in my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Aegis, I export the data, then sync it to Google Drive in my main phone, then sync it back to my backup phone.&lt;br&gt;
For safety, I also store Aegis data locally on all of my laptops (Encrypted of course).&lt;br&gt;
The rule is you always need 2 phones for OTPs, one for carrying around, one always stays at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main problem here is the OTP, I can not store all of my OTPs in the cloud completely.&lt;br&gt;
Because if I want to access my OTPs in the cloud, I should log in, and then input my OTP, this is a circle, my friends.&lt;br&gt;
The easiest answer is the old phone, which is safe at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#recovery-strategy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Recovery strategy
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many strategies that I process to react as if something strange is happening to my devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I lost my laptops, single laptop or all, do not panic as long as I have my phones.&lt;br&gt;
The OTPs are in there, the passwords are in Bitwarden cloud, other data is in Google Drive so nothing is lost here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I lost my main phone, but not my laptop, I use the OTPs which are stored locally in my laptops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I lost my main phone, and my laptops, I use the OTPs in my old phone.&lt;br&gt;
Then I go to the nearest SIM store to recover my SIM, as I register my ID with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the worst situation, I lost everything, my laptops, my phones (Main phone and old).&lt;br&gt;
The first step is to recover my SIM, then log in to Google account using the password and SMS OTP.&lt;br&gt;
After that, log in to Bitwarden account using the master password and OTP from Gmail, which I open previously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-end"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The end
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide will be updated regularly I promise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello Devs, if you want to become a Python web developer and looking for the best online courses to learn Django, Flask, and Python web development, then you have come to the right place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, I have shared the &lt;a href="https://www.java67.com/2020/05/top-5-courses-to-learn-python-in-depth.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;best Python courses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/01/top-5-courses-to-learn-flask-for-web-development-with-python.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;best Flask courses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and today, I will share the best course to learn everything about Python web development. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may know that Python is a multi-purpose programming language meaning that you can use it in different fields such as GUI application, artificial intelligence, and web application, and much more, just to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from &lt;a href="https://www.java67.com/2018/10/top-10-data-science-and-machine-learning-courses.html"&gt;Data Science&lt;/a&gt;, Web development is another area where &lt;a href="https://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-python-online-courses-for-beginners.html"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; shines because of its excellent tools, libraries, and frameworks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, when we talk about web applications, one of the best python frameworks that are popular is the Django framework which allows you to create a Python web application very quickly and easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Django is a robust Python framework that is used to create web applications; this tool is considered one of the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/04/top-5-python-web-development-frameworks.html"&gt;best web development frameworks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to develop websites that work with databases such as content management systems (CMS), customer relationship management (CRM), Object Relational Mapping (ORM), and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are getting started with web development in Python or want to become a Python web developer and looking for some online training courses to &lt;strong&gt;learn Django in 2022&lt;/strong&gt; then you have come to the right place.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Which programming language should you learn in 2022 to remain relevant and also increase your revenue.</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/ifycoool/which-programming-language-should-you-learn-in-2022-to-remain-relevant-and-also-increase-your-revenue-2gh9</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The advice I got was to learn Java, because during that period Java was reigning in my geographical location at least. I did my research and I felt why not Java. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often times when we make up our mind to become a software developer most of us think like this, but the simple truth is that things are more complicated than anyone thinking of the technology to start their software career with, just to be an instant hit in no time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's get the point straight, am not saying you shouldn't look out for a promising tech skill to acquire on the contrary am saying the tech space is hug and if you must be relevant in that hug tech space you need first choose which part to function in that hug tech space and then learn the most promising technology for part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Tech space you can decide to be a frontend dev, backend dev, machine learning expert, data analyst, etc... These different fields have different programming languages, libraries and frameworks people have learned to use for them, take for example Frontend engineers often use Javascript and maybe ReactJS or Vue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's important to first know if you would love to be a Frontend or backend developer, before choosing a programming language to learn. When choosing a language to learn as a starter is best to choose the most promising, when I use the word promising I mean acquiring a tech skill that is in high demand today and will be tomorrow, yes that's possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every developer wants to remain relevant in the Tech space and the best way to achieve that today is to identify the language of today and of the FUTURE. Talking about the language of the future, first we need ask how far in the future are we talking?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than a decade out? Hard to say. More than two? Impossible. Looking at current trends, though:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;JavaScript is taking over almost everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;TypeScript is catching up as the best way to use JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python is nailing machine learning, but losing momentum on servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julia could come up from behind and displace Python in Machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Java is pretty well embedded in the enterprise space, but there are cracks around the edge of its dominance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go might survive due to strong Google backing, though I have a hard time recommending it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swift is likely to stick around as the Apple platform language for the foreseeable future. But it doesn't seem likely to make the jump to anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kotlin could displace Java. Scala has had its chance, but it appears to have failed in garnering market share. I frankly don't see that changing any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;C# is probably going to persist in some enterprise companies, and as the language of Unity3d and Xamarin.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the high performance end, it's a hard call. C++ has ruled this roost for two decades, and has received some recent updates that look great. But Rust seems to have a strictly better type system, which provides better compile-time code verification with equivalent or better performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;C is the low level language of the past. Like COBOL, there's a crap ton of code written for it, so it won't just vanish. But except in narrow cases I don't see C as being a good language for new development. Rust is strictly better for anything that you might want to start in C today. I think this will be increasingly true. So in that respect, Rust may be more likely to be a major language in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This are noticeable trends anyways, so dig in choose your area of relevance (e.g Frontend), research more about a technology to learn maybe Python or JavaScript, start learning and start building things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first language will be hardest, because you're learning how to program for the first time. After that, the second language will be easier, and so forth. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The easiest way to unsubscribe from Observables in Angular</title>
      <author>Volodymyr Yepishev</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2021 09:19:36 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/bwca/the-easiest-way-to-unsubscribe-from-observables-in-angular-4cg4</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/bwca/the-easiest-way-to-unsubscribe-from-observables-in-angular-4cg4</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;...is of course using the &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; pipe, but the article is not about it. It's about situations where you need to subscribe inside component's &lt;code&gt;ts&lt;/code&gt; file and how to deal with it. This article is about dealing with repetitive logic of cancelling subscription in different components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The actual repo used for this article can be found &lt;a href="https://github.com/Bwca/easy-ubsubscribe-from-observable-in-angular-with-a-service"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing subscriptions in Angular can get quite repetitive and even imperative if you are not using the &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; pipe. The rule of thumb is if you subscribe, you should always unsubscribe. Indeed, there are finite observables which autocomplete, but those are separate cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article we will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create an Angular application with memory leaks caused by the absence of unsubscribing from an &lt;code&gt;Observable&lt;/code&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fix the leaks with a custom unsubscribe service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only things we are going to use are &lt;code&gt;rxjs&lt;/code&gt; and Angular features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let's create our applications and add some components. I'll be using &lt;code&gt;npx&lt;/code&gt; since I don't install any packages globally.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx @angular/cli new ng-super-easy-unsubscribe &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;ng-super-easy-unsubscribe
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To illustrate leaks we need two more things: a service to emit infinite number of values via an &lt;code&gt;Observable&lt;/code&gt; and a component that will subscribe to it, perform some memory consuming operation in subscribe function and never unsubscribe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we will proceed switching it on and off to cause memory leaks and see how it goes :)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx @angular/cli generate component careless
npx @angular/cli generate service services/interval/interval
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As I have already stated the interval service is just for endless emissions of observables, so we'll put only &lt;code&gt;interval&lt;/code&gt; there:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// src/app/services/interval/interval.service.ts&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Injectable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@angular/core&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;interval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Observable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;rxjs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Injectable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;providedIn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;IntervalService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Observable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;interval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;250&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The application component is going to be busy with nothing else than toggling the &lt;code&gt;CarelessComponent&lt;/code&gt; on and off, with mere 4 lines of template we can put it directly in the &lt;code&gt;ts&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// src/app/app.component.ts&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@angular/core&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;app-root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`
    &amp;lt;section&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;button (click)="toggleChild()"&amp;gt;toggle child&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;app-careless *ngIf="isChildVisible"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/app-careless&amp;gt;
  `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;styleUrls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;./app.component.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AppComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;isChildVisible&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;toggleChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isChildVisible&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isChildVisible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To get a better view of memory leaks it is a good idea to just dump some random string arrays into a bigger array of trash on every &lt;code&gt;Observable&lt;/code&gt; emission.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// src/app/careless/careless.component.ts&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;OnInit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@angular/core&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;IntervalService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;../services/interval/interval.service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;UnsubscribeService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;../services/unsubscribe/unsubscribe.service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;app-careless&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;ಠ_ಠ&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;CarelessComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;OnInit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;garbage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[][]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[];&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;intervalService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;IntervalService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ngOnInit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;intervalService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;subscribe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;garbage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;some trash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Start the application, go to developer tools in the browser and check Total JS heap size, it is relatively small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IoPP-Ti1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x745yynjuhlno6ofae8z.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IoPP-Ti1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x745yynjuhlno6ofae8z.jpg" alt='"No leaking yet"' width="468" height="451"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If in addition to piling garbage in component property you log it to console, you can crash the page pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pAosdvyu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7e93f2kq3u00ppkpj8j0.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pAosdvyu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7e93f2kq3u00ppkpj8j0.jpg" alt='"Tab crashed"' width="880" height="368"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the allocated memory is never released, it will keep adding more junk every time &lt;code&gt;CarelessComponent&lt;/code&gt; instance comes to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--v6SvwF-1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vrtqqbxd3pjuufkqtykg.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--v6SvwF-1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vrtqqbxd3pjuufkqtykg.jpg" alt='"No released"' width="861" height="135"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what happened? We've leaked and crashed because each toggle on cause new subscription and each toggle off did not cause any subscription cancelling to fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to avoid it we should unsubscribe when the component gets destroyed. We could place that logic in our component, or create a base component with that logic and extend it or... we can actually create a service that provides a custom &lt;code&gt;rxjs&lt;/code&gt; operator that unsubscribes once the component is destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How will a service know the component is being destroyed? Normally services are provided as singletons on root level, but if we remove the &lt;code&gt;providedIn&lt;/code&gt; property in the &lt;code&gt;@Injectable&lt;/code&gt; decorator, we can provide the service on component level, which allows us to access &lt;code&gt;OnDestroy&lt;/code&gt; hook in the service. And this is how we will know component is being destroyed, because the service will be destroyed too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's do it!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx @angular/cli generate service services/unsubscribe/unsubscribe
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Inside the service we place the good old subscription cancelling logic with &lt;code&gt;Subject&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;takeUntil&lt;/code&gt; operator:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Injectable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;OnDestroy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@angular/core&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Observable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Subject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;takeUntil&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;rxjs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Injectable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;UnsubscriberService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;OnDestroy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;destroy$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Subject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Subject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;untilDestroyed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;source$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Observable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Observable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;source$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;pipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;takeUntil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;destroy$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ngOnDestroy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;destroy$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;destroy$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;unsubscribe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Note that an arrow function is used for the &lt;code&gt;untilDestroyed&lt;/code&gt; method, as when used as &lt;code&gt;rxjs&lt;/code&gt; operator we will lose the context unless we use arrow function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively instead of using arrow function in a property we could also have used a getter to return an arrow function, which would look like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;untilDestroyed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;source$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Observable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Observable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Observable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;source$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;pipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;takeUntil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;destroy$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I'll go with the getter variant because I do not enjoy arrow function in class properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now on to fixing our careless component, we add &lt;code&gt;UnsubscribeService&lt;/code&gt; to its &lt;code&gt;providers&lt;/code&gt; array, inject it into the constructor and apply its operator in our subscription pipe:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;OnInit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@angular/core&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;IntervalService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;../services/interval/interval.service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;UnsubscribeService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;../services/unsubscribe/unsubscribe.service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;app-careless&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;ಠ_ಠ&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;providers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;UnsubscribeService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;CarelessComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;OnInit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;intervalService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;IntervalService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;unsubscribeService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;UnsubscribeService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ngOnInit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;intervalService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;pipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;unsubscribeService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;untilDestroyed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;subscribe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;permutations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;findPermutations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;abcdefg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you go back to the application and try toggling the child component on and off you will notice that it doesn't leak anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Gp1Fmy6R--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/00lp2niw8gktmg6ltm06.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Gp1Fmy6R--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/00lp2niw8gktmg6ltm06.jpg" alt='"No more leaks"' width="693" height="93"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No imperative cancelling subscription logic in the component, no &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; pipes, no external packages needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy peasy lemon squeezy :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Yielding Bells 🔔  - generators in PHP</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today we want us some bells in our Christmas, so let's create them. PHP has a neat feature called generators. Generators are functions that can be used to create iterators, and they don't need a large overhead to create them. For performance sake, let's compare two code snippets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Snippet 1&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;produceBells&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$bells&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$bells&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'🔔'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$bells&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$hundredBells&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;produceBells&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 8.3KB&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;foreach&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$hundredBells&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$bell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$bell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;' '&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snippet 2&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;generateBells&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;yield&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'🔔'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$hundredBells&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;generateBells&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//544 bytes&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;foreach&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$hundredBells&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$bell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$bell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;' '&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both these snippets will produce this output:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is that a hundred bells? I sure hope so, I get lost when counting them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is now, which is less memory intensive, and why is &lt;strong&gt;Snippet 2&lt;/strong&gt;?! I ran both snippets with profile-mode on Xdebug and found the following result:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Snippet&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Type&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Memory usage&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Array&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8280 bytes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Generator&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;544 bytes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we can see, the generator is a lot more memory efficient than the array. The reason for this is that generators are lazy, and only generate the values when they are needed. This means that the memory usage is only as high as the amount of values that are actually needed. And as we loop through one item at a time to echo it out, that is as much memory as will be used. You could output a million of these things if you like, and the memory usage would not be that much higher. (In fact, it remained at 544 bytes when I ran it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what's the cost? Generators, while memory efficient, are not as time efficient. My machine is not stable enough (poor potato), to do a fair benchmarking. But at a thousand bells we got 9.2 ms for the array and 11.6 ms for the generator. So is it worth it for you to use generators? That question has not only to do with time versus memory cost. If you don't know how often you will need to access an array (or iterator) value, you may need to use a generator anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-about-you"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What about you?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever tried a generator before? What use cases do you have or think you would have for generators? Comment below and let us know what you think ✍&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Code an API Call with React!</title>
      <author>Ustariz Enzo</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2021 08:16:11 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/ziratsu/how-to-code-an-api-call-with-react-59kf</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/ziratsu/how-to-code-an-api-call-with-react-59kf</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey &lt;strong&gt;fellow creators&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's code an &lt;em&gt;API Call&lt;/em&gt; with React. &lt;br&gt;
This is pretty common and you need to master it if you want to use React.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you prefer to watch the video &lt;strong&gt;version&lt;/strong&gt;, it's right here :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bBjsFmagQXc"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-the-hooks-you-need"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. The hooks you need!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to import two hooks:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"app"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;React API Call&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now create your state which will start at false since at first you don't have any data:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;imgURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setImgURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"app"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;React API Call&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-fetch-an-api"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Fetch an API
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find a random image API and do a fetch when the component is mounted, using the hook &lt;em&gt;useEffect()&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start by simply logging the response of the fetch to check if it's working:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;https://source.unsplash.com/random/600x800&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It will be triggered after the first render of the component!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the response is not JSON, you don't need to parse it, you can just extract the URL from it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;https://source.unsplash.com/random/600x800&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setImgURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now you can add the image to your JSX:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"app"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;React API Call&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;imgURL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;imgURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You're using the short circuit operator, meaning that it'll only render the image if &lt;em&gt;imgUrl&lt;/em&gt; is true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you refresh the page, you'll see that you have a different image each time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how you can do a pretty &lt;em&gt;basic API call with React&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come and take a look at my &lt;strong&gt;Youtube channel&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Learntocreate/videos"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/c/Learntocreate/videos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;See you soon!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enzo. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CSS Practices to avoid as a developer Pt.2</title>
      <author>Mursal Furqan</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2021 08:14:46 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/mursalfk/css-practices-to-avoid-as-a-developer-pt2-94</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/mursalfk/css-practices-to-avoid-as-a-developer-pt2-94</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So after an awesome response on my previous article titled &lt;a href="https://dev.to/mursalfk/css-practices-to-avoid-as-a-developer-3hj2"&gt;CSS Practices to avoid as a developer&lt;/a&gt;, I am back with part 2 of the same, with some more awesome topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/Lny6Rw04nsOOc/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/Lny6Rw04nsOOc/giphy.gif" alt="Img" width="480" height="360"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#use-transform-translate50-50-to-center"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Use Transform: Translate(-50%, 50%) to center
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, one solution was to use a combination of Absolute Positioning and the Transform property. This technique caused blurry text issues in Chromium-Based Browsers. We can use margin: auto, inside a flex container and the browser will center the element. Just two simple properties, and that's it.&lt;br&gt;
For example: Instead of using&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.parent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;relative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.child&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;absolute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nl"&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nl"&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;translate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;-50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;we can use:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.parent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.child&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#important-is-unnecessarily-used-in-most-places"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  !Important is unnecessarily used in most places
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In CSS, styles are cascading, or overlapping from the top of one to another. But, when you bring down !Important in between, it will dominate the others and as the name suggests, it will establish that it is important over the other. JUST DON'T USE IT UNNECESSARILY.&lt;br&gt;
For example: Instead of using&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.parent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;!important&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#fff&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;!important&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bold&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;!important&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;this method is preferred&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.parent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#fff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NOTE: In most of the cases, you need to realign some new classes, and !important can be used when the realign is not possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#long-selectors-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Long Selectors #..#..... {}
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only is this selector using Ids, it's also LONG. Just like Ids, if you are using long selectors (that are greater than three levels deep) you're increasing specificity. As a result, you'll be compounding the problem over time as regular maintenance and updates occur.&lt;br&gt;
So instead of using this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;#header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;#title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.left-side&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.logo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nl"&gt;opacity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We should try using this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.logo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nl"&gt;opacity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#inline-styles-in-css"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Inline styles in CSS
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although CSS offers us to maintain styles inline too, being a developer, we should skip the practice of using them.&lt;br&gt;
Hence, instead of using&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;style=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"outline: none;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     Login
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can start using&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"login_btn"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     Login
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.login_btn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;outline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Well, so that was all for this article. Do share below in the comments what more practices in CSS you consider as BAD being a developer. 😉😉&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>10 HTML anchor tag usages you must know(in short videos)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a webdev, you must have used the anchor(a) tag ample times. The regular usages are, linking to a webpage, opening the page in a new tab, or linking to a page section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are other usages, you should know as well. I have created a short video series to cover all the usages. The series also includes a video to style anchor tag. I hope you find them helpful and enjoy watching them.&lt;/p&gt;
