      <title>Prevent Configuration Errors in Kubernetes</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/solegaonkar/prevent-configuration-errors-in-kubernetes-30dn</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was 3AM on a Monday. The team had experienced a sleepless weekend, trying to dig into a production failure. In just a few hours, the work week would begin, and we all knew that the world needed this application to work. It would be a disaster if this issue were not fixed before then. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why did it fail? It worked last week. Why did it stop working today? A recent code change? But that was absolutely unrelated. We tested it - with all the rigor. We had setup the best test automation, topped with some manual tests as well. Even further, our microservices are scanned and reviewed by effective tools. Why then did it fail? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started cursing our fate and the tools we used. Management started yelling at us. You said K8s is meant for resilience and it enables applications that can never fail. But we have seen more trouble than solution. Never use Open Source! And all that blah..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But after hours of struggle, fate smiled - just in time - and we discovered the problem with the YML configuration. Some progressive minded developer had not specified the version of the embedded opensource DB used in there - he had used a "latest" - hoping to get the best features as they are released. A new version was available, and that broke some existing functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hush! Our job was saved. We managed to resolve the issue and then crashed into the bed - as the world started using our application that was functioning as before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-rca"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The RCA
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this sound familiar? I am sure it does. We have all seen disasters caused by misconfiguration in Kubernetes. The problem is in the power of the tool. With great power comes great responsibility. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is so much that we configure in there, and there are very few developers who really understand these configurations well enough. Most of them make these configurations using other existing configurations - a copy/paste, with modifying some parts that make sense to them. Or the adventurous ones pick the YML files straight from some online tutorials - which were good to prove a point, but not mature enough for the production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we use infrastructure as code we tend to forget that it is also a piece of code, that should go through all the validation like a normal application code. It is often tempting to use shortcuts that work today. They work and get deployed into production. And we assume that they will work forever. But unfortunately, that is not the case with Kubernetes configurations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world is still new to the Kubernetes Patterns. Developers are still struggling their way though it - so are the admins. And too much of configuration goes into the system, making it easy for such errors to creep in. Worse still, most of these errors show their impact after a few days, or even months. The system works perfectly until it just collapses without any warning. This makes the task even more difficult&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#common-problems"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Common Problems
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no end to our creativity, and our ability - to introduce newer and newer defects in the system. But there are some common issues that show up very often. Let us look at them one by one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#default-namespace"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Default Namespace
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a common mistake new developers make - when they pick the configurations from tutorials and blogs. Most of them are meant to explain the concept and syntax. To keep that simple, most of them skip the other complexities like namespace. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But any Kubernetes deployment should have a meaningful namespace in the architecture. If we miss it out by error, it can cause name clashes in future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#deprecated-apis"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Deprecated API's
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes is going through an active development. Lot of developers across the globe are working hard on improving it and making it more and more resilient. An unfortunate consequence is that we have some API's getting deprecated in newer releases. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to identify and remove them before they begin failing in production. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#naked-pods"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Naked Pods
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes provides for "Deployments" - as a way to encapsulate pods and all that they need. But some lazy developers may want to skip this and deploy just the pod into Kubernetes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, this may work today. But it is a bad practice, and will definitely lead to a disaster some day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#namespace-sharing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Namespace Sharing
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When entities at different levels share the namespace, the lower entity can access neighbors of the higher entity - to probe the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, when a container is allowed to share its host's network namespace, it can access local network listeners and leverage it to probe the host's local network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a security risk. Even if it is our own code, the minimal access principle recommends that this should not be allowed. When it comes to system security, we should never believe in anyone - not even ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#not-respecting-the-abstraction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Not Respecting the Abstraction
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All communications between the containers should go through the layers of abstraction provided by Kubernetes. Communication between services has to go through the abstractions of ingress and service defined in the deployments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never run containers with root privilege. Never expose node ports from services, or access host files directly in code (using UID). Ingress should forward traffic to the service, not directly to individual pods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hardcoding IP addresses, or directly accessing the docker sockets, etc.. can lead to problems. Again, these won't break the system on the very first day. But it will show up sometime someday - when we just can't afford it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#incorrect-image-tags"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Incorrect Image tags
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a common disaster. Developers are often tempted to use "latest" - with the hope of improving continuously, getting the latest and best version available. Such a configuration can live in our system for many months. But, it can lead to a nasty surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;﻿When an image tag is not descriptive (e.g. lacking the version tag like 1.19.8), every time that image is pulled, the version will be a different version and might break our code. Also, a non-descriptive image tag does not allow us to easily roll back (or forward) to different image versions. It is better to use concrete and meaningful tags such as version strings or an image SHA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#believing-in-defaults"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Believing in Defaults
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another problem that shows up very often - when we are not very confident of a configuration, we tend to believe in the defaults. The memory/CPU allocation, min/max replica counts for auto scaling... these are some of the properties that are missed too often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#datree"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Datree
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we noted, there are too many configurations that go into the Kubernetes cluster. Helm tries to reduce this complexity, but makes things worse, when we try to configure Helm itself. It is impossible for a human to ensure the quality that we need in our production deployments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need some good tools that can automate this process, and help us with this end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some discussion on tech platforms, and a lot of Google / StackOverflow / YouTube, we found a few interesting tools. After comparing them, we chose &lt;a href="https://www.datree.io/"&gt;Datree&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is simple to set up and use. It can be easily integrated with most CI/CD tools. It helps us identify such issues much before they can cause a problem. It has a lavish free tier and does not lock in - all that we need in an ideal tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installation
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installing the tool is quite easy and fast. Run the below command. We need the sudo permissions.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl https://get.datree.io | /bin/bash
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A few seconds, and we are ready to go! Most of us are uncomfortable running such a command - we should be. We can just check out the actual code that is executed by script. Just open the link&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
 in the browser.



```bash
#!/bin/bash

osName=$(uname -s)
DOWNLOAD_URL=$(curl --silent "https://api.github.com/repos/datreeio/datree/releases/latest" | grep -o "browser_download_url.*\_${osName}_x86_64.zip")

DOWNLOAD_URL=${DOWNLOAD_URL//\"}
DOWNLOAD_URL=${DOWNLOAD_URL/browser_download_url: /}

OUTPUT_BASENAME=datree-latest
OUTPUT_BASENAME_WITH_POSTFIX=$OUTPUT_BASENAME.zip

echo "Installing Datree..."
echo

curl -sL $DOWNLOAD_URL -o $OUTPUT_BASENAME_WITH_POSTFIX
echo -e "\033[32m[V] Downloaded Datree"

unzip -qq $OUTPUT_BASENAME_WITH_POSTFIX -d $OUTPUT_BASENAME

mkdir -p ~/.datree

rm -f /usr/local/bin/datree || sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/datree
cp $OUTPUT_BASENAME/datree /usr/local/bin || sudo cp $OUTPUT_BASENAME/datree /usr/local/bin

rm $OUTPUT_BASENAME_WITH_POSTFIX
rm -rf $OUTPUT_BASENAME

curl -s https://get.datree.io/k8s-demo.yaml &amp;gt; ~/.datree/k8s-demo.yaml
echo -e "[V] Finished Installation"

echo

echo -e "\033[35m Usage: $ datree test ~/.datree/k8s-demo.yaml"

echo -e " Using Helm? =&amp;gt; https://hub.datree.io/helm-plugin"

tput init

echo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Essentially, it just downloads a zip file and expands it into the specified locations. It places the binary into the /usr/local/bin folder - for which it needs a sudo. It does not mess with any system configuration and so it is very simple to remove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-simple-demo"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A Simple Demo
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The datree installation provides a sample yaml file - for a POC.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;datree &lt;span class="nb"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt; ~/.datree/k8s-demo.yaml                                                                 
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;  File: ../../.datree/k8s-demo.yaml                                                                    

❌  Ensure each container has a configured memory limit  &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;1 occurrences]                                  
💡  Missing property object &lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;limits.memory&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt; - value should be within the accepted boundaries recommended 
by the organization                                                                                      

❌  Ensure each container has a configured liveness probe  &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;1 occurrences]                                
💡  Missing property object &lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;livenessProbe&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt; - add a properly configured livenessProbe to catch possible d
eadlocks                                                                                                 

❌  Ensure workload has valid label values  &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;1 occurrences]                                               
💡  Incorrect value &lt;span class="k"&gt;for &lt;/span&gt;key&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;s&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; under &lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;labels&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt; - the vales syntax is not valid so it will not be accepted 
by the Kuberenetes engine                                                                                

❌  Ensure each container image has a pinned &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;tag&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; version  &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;1 occurrences]                               
💡  Incorrect value &lt;span class="k"&gt;for &lt;/span&gt;key &lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;image&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt; - specify an image version to avoid unpleasant “version surprises” &lt;span class="k"&gt;in
 &lt;/span&gt;the future                                                                                              


+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+                  
| Enabled rules &lt;span class="k"&gt;in &lt;/span&gt;policy “default” | 21                                              |                  
| Configs tested against policy     | 1                                               |                  
| Total rules evaluated             | 21                                              |                  
| Total rules failed                | 4                                               |                  
| Total rules passed                | 17                                              |                  
| See all rules &lt;span class="k"&gt;in &lt;/span&gt;policy           | https://app.datree.io/login?cliId&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;GStykNg6GkUAS8LfaEt2B8  |                  
+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+                  

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interesting? Well that was just a glimpse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#online-view"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Online View
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the URL it generates at the end of the table -&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;https://app.datree.io/login?cliId=GStykNg6GkUAS8LfaEt2B8&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a unique ID assigned to your system. It is stored in a config file in home folder.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# cat .datree/config.yaml&lt;/span&gt;
token: t4e73q9ZxkXhKhcg4vYHDF
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Open the link in a browser. It prompts us to log in with Google / Github. As we login, this Unique ID is connected with the new account on Datree. We can now tailor the tool from the web UI. Also, will see the reports from all the tests&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#filters-and-policies"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Filters and Policies
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--t0XlIWeh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633599793306/-fMZUlro2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--t0XlIWeh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633599793306/-fMZUlro2.png" alt="image.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There we can see detailed setup for the tests. We can alter that and the same is used when the yaml files are evaluated. We can choose what we feel is important and skip what we feel can be ignored. If we want, we can be a rebel and allow a class of errors to go through. Datree gives us that flexibility as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the default policy available to us, we can define more custom policies that can be triggered as per our need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Datree provides "Filters" for all the above mentioned potential issues, and many more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#history"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  History
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the left panel, we can see a link for "History". Click on it, and we will see the history of all the validations that it has performed so far. So we can just view the status of policy checks right here - without having to open the "black screen"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ulNz3xDI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633599855062/_n6y-vTSw.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ulNz3xDI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633599855062/_n6y-vTSw.png" alt="image.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time we invoke the datree command, it connects to the cloud with this ID and pulls the required configuration, and then uploads the report for the run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#compatible-with-tools"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Compatible with Tools
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we saw above, we can trigger the datree in a single command. Much more than that, it also provides wonderful compatibility with most of the configuration management tools and managed Kubernetes deployments like AKS, EKS and GKS. And ofcourse, we cannot forget Helm when working with Kubernetes. Datree provides a simple plugin on helm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TUs_g7Pl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633600367476/s3vRTEyyF.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TUs_g7Pl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633600367476/s3vRTEyyF.png" alt="image.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Datree has an &lt;a href="https://hub.datree.io/"&gt;elaborate documentation&lt;/a&gt; and set of "How to" tutorials on their website. You can refer to them for quickly setting up any feature that you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dont-wait-for-a-disaster"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Don't Wait for a Disaster
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the applications across the globe have a lot of such misconfigurations - that will surely bring a nasty disaster some day. We knew our application had this problem. But we underestimated the extent of damage that it could cause. We were just procrastinating, sitting on a timebomb! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I tell everyone, don't do what we did. Don't wait for the disaster. Automate the configuration checks and enjoy your weekends.&lt;/p&gt;

  What is Bubble Sort?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through lists that need to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This passing procedure is repeated until no swaps are required, indicating that the list is sorted. Bubble sort gets its name because smaller elements bubble toward the top of the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bubble sort is also referred to as sinking sort or comparison sort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#explanation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Explanation
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bubble sort has a worst-case and average complexity of O(n2), where n is the number of items sorted. Unlike the other sorting algorithms, bubble sort detects whether the sorted list is efficiently built into the algorithm. Bubble sort performance over an already sorted list is O(n).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The position of elements in bubble sort plays an important role in determining performance. Large elements at the beginning do not pose a problem as they are easily swapped. The small elements toward the end move to the beginning slowly. As such, these elements are called rabbits and turtles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bubble sort algorithm can be optimized by placing larger elements in the final position. After every pass, all elements after the last swap are sorted and do not need to be checked again, thereby skipping the tracking of swapped variables. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now we know what bubble sort is, So let's start writing code&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    arr := []int{5, 3, 4, 9, 6, 8, 0, 1, 2}
    fmt.Println(arr)

    // Way 1 next index checking with current index
    // 1. x pointer is on index 0
    // 2. y pointer in on index 1
    // each time whenever y execution finishes it increment values for both
    // whenever x starts again for next index
    for x := range arr {
        var swapped bool
        y := x + 1
        for y = range arr {
            if arr[x] &amp;lt; arr[y] {
                arr[x], arr[y] = arr[y], arr[x]
                swapped = true
            }
        }
        if !swapped {
            break
        }
    }


&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>React Native: Streaming Agora Cloud-Recording HLS Videos from an S3 Bucket</title>
      <author>Ekaansh Arora</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Oct 2021 10:03:34 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/ekaansharora/react-native-streaming-agora-cloud-recording-hls-videos-from-an-s3-bucket-4n6l</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/ekaansharora/react-native-streaming-agora-cloud-recording-hls-videos-from-an-s3-bucket-4n6l</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.agora.io/en/blog/cloud-recording-for-react-native-video-chat-using-agora/"&gt;previous blog&lt;/a&gt; post, we looked at how to add Agora cloud recording to a video chat application for storing the recordings in an Amazon S3 bucket. Here, we’ll go over how to fetch and playback the recorded videos in a React Native application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve updated the &lt;a href="https://github.com/EkaanshArora/Agora-RN-Record-Playback"&gt;app&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://github.com/EkaanshArora/Agora-Cloud-Recording-Example"&gt;back end&lt;/a&gt; from the last blog post to bring everything together. If you just want the demo, you can deploy the back end and build the app from the links provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prerequisites"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Prerequisites
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An Agora developer account (see How to Get Started)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An Amazon AWS account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Heroku account or another service to deploy the back end&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding of React Native&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#agora-setup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Agora Setup
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Create a project&lt;/strong&gt;: Once you have an Agora account, click the Project Management tab in the console. Click the Create button. Enter a name for your project. Select Secured Mode while creating the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Enable cloud recording&lt;/strong&gt;: Click the View usage button and select the option to enable cloud recording.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Get app credentials&lt;/strong&gt;: Copy the App ID and the App Certificate from the same page to a text file. We’ll use these later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Get customer credentials&lt;/strong&gt;: Visit the RESTful API page and click the Add Secret button. Copy the Customer ID and the Customer Secret to a text file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aws-setup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AWS Setup
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve created an AWS account, we need to create an Amazon S3 bucket to store our video recordings and an IAM user to access our bucket. If you have already completed this setup, you can skip this section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to your &lt;a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users"&gt;AWS IAM Console&lt;/a&gt; and create a user. Add the AmazonS3FullAccess policy with Programmatic Access. Copy your AWS Access Key and Secret Key to the text file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an Amazon &lt;a href="https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home"&gt;S3 bucket&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VyGfNr5i--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://miro.medium.com/1%2A2LAlWLeGZNd7QGibCKFEbA.png" alt="aws screenshot"&gt;
Choose a name for your bucket and copy it to a text file. We’ll use this text file later. Allow public access to stream media from your bucket by deselecting the block all public access check box. Click the Create Bucket button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: With the URL for your recording, anyone on the internet can view it. We’ll discuss how to make the recording secure at the end of the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll also need the region number for the selected AWS region. Go to this &lt;a href="https://docs.agora.io/en/cloud-recording/cloud_recording_api_rest?platform=RESTful#a-namestorageconfigacloud-storage-configuration"&gt;table&lt;/a&gt;, click the Amazon S3 tab, and note your region number. For example, if you’re using the US_EAST_1 region, your bucket number is 0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the bucket policy.
To make files accessible by all users, we’ll add a bucket policy. Go to the Permissions tab in your newly created bucket and add this policy:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "Policy1620917655085",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt1620917653925",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::agora-rec123/*"
        }
    ]
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#deploying-our-back-end"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Deploying Our Back End
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before deploying our back end, we need the following variables. (It’s time to use our text file.) We’ll be using the Heroku one-click deploy to make it super simple to get our back end up and running. You can use any other service as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: We’ve updated the back end, so if you’re using the back end from the previous post, you should update it now.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;APP_ID=
APP_CERTIFICATE=
RECORDING_VENDOR=
RECORDING_REGION=
BUCKET_NAME=
BUCKET_ACCESS_KEY=
BUCKET_ACCESS_SECRET=
CUSTOMER_ID=
CUSTOMER_CERTIFICATE=
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: RECORDING_VENDOR=1 for AWS. Click this link for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an account on Heroku if you haven’t done so already.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click this link to use the Heroku one-click deploy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter your variables and click the Deploy App button at the bottom of the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wait a few minutes. Once the deployment is complete, save your back-end URL in a text file, which we’ll use in the app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#building-our-app"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Building Our App
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll start from the app we developed in the last post, which lets you take part in group video calls and record them. I’ve refactored the app to move all the video call and recording components to &lt;code&gt;./components/Call.tsx&lt;/code&gt;. We’ll start with a new file: &lt;code&gt;./components/PlayRecording.tsx&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="ltag_gist-liquid-tag"&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We’ll use the Video component from react-native-video for HLS playback. We take in the back-end URL, App ID, and channel name as props to our PlayRecording component. We define an interface for our state. tracks will contain an array of URLs for each m3u8 file. currentTrack is the index of the URL we’re playing. statusMsg holds a string to display the current status of the video player.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="ltag_gist-liquid-tag"&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We define our component and our initial state. In the &lt;code&gt;componentDidMount&lt;/code&gt; we perform a GET request to the &lt;code&gt;/api/get/recordingUrls/&amp;lt;ChannelName&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; route of our back-end server. We get the response JSON and update the &lt;code&gt;tracks&lt;/code&gt; state array.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="ltag_gist-liquid-tag"&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In our render method, we’re returning a list of tracks wrapped in &lt;code&gt;TouchableOpacity&lt;/code&gt; using a &lt;code&gt;ScrollView&lt;/code&gt;. When a track is selected, we update the &lt;code&gt;currentTrack&lt;/code&gt; state with the track index.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="ltag_gist-liquid-tag"&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We use the &lt;code&gt;Video&lt;/code&gt; component with the source set as the URL we want to play (&lt;code&gt;currentTrack&lt;/code&gt; index of our &lt;code&gt;tracks&lt;/code&gt; array). We have event handlers to update our &lt;code&gt;statusMsg&lt;/code&gt;. We also display the &lt;code&gt;statusMsg&lt;/code&gt; in a &lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt; component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#putting-it-back-together"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Putting it back together
&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag_gist-liquid-tag"&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
We use the &lt;code&gt;PlayRecording&lt;/code&gt; component in our &lt;code&gt;App.tsx&lt;/code&gt; along with the Call component to put everything back together.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security Consideration&lt;/strong&gt;: As we discussed, with our current configuration all the recordings stored on the S3 bucket are public so that the React Native client can access them. Before we use the app in production, it’s important to set access control for our videos. Once we get our users authenticated, we can issue them access to the files, while keeping the files private for everyone else. You can find more information &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-control-overview.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find more information about cloud recording &lt;a href="https://docs.agora.io/en/cloud-recording/landing-page?platform=RESTful"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re starting out with the Agora SDKs, take a look at the &lt;a href="https://docs.agora.io/en/Video/landing-page?platform=React%20Native"&gt;Agora Video Call Quickstart Guide&lt;/a&gt; and this &lt;a href="https://www.agora.io/en/blog/how-to-build-a-react-native-video-calling-app-using-agora/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I invite you to join the &lt;a href="https://www.agora.io/en/join-slack/"&gt;Agora Developer Slack community&lt;/a&gt;. Feel free to ask any React Native questions in the &lt;code&gt;#react-native-help-me&lt;/code&gt; channel and cloud recording questions in the &lt;code&gt;#cloud-recording-help-me&lt;/code&gt; channel.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to manage object in Angular FormControl</title>
      <author>Dharmen Shah</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Oct 2021 09:37:24 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/shhdharmen/how-to-manage-object-in-angular-formcontrol-2ph4</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/shhdharmen/how-to-manage-object-in-angular-formcontrol-2ph4</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, we will learn how to manage object in FormControl and handle conversion for input&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally we use &lt;code&gt;FormControl&lt;/code&gt; with either &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;boolean&lt;/code&gt; types and hence it manages only simple values. But what if we want to manage just more than primitive data types? We can do that, let’s see how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in this tutorial we will learn how to get country-code and number as separate entities from the same form-control, and we will also create custom input for the same to handle the conversion between UI and value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-telephone-class"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Telephone Class
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume that we have a &lt;code&gt;Telephone&lt;/code&gt; class, which will hold the related values:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Telephone&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;countryCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;phoneNumber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, let’s take an &lt;code&gt;input[type=tel]&lt;/code&gt; in which we want to hold the &lt;code&gt;Telephone&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;app-root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`
    &amp;lt;input
      type="tel"
      name="telephone"
      id="telephone"
      [formControl]="telephone"
    /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Value: {{ telephone.value | json }}&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
  `&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AppComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;telephone&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;FormControl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Telephone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notice how we have initialized the new &lt;code&gt;Telephone&lt;/code&gt; class in &lt;code&gt;FormControl&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at output now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--s46W00hU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/9O98N6z.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--s46W00hU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/9O98N6z.gif" alt="Form control with object" title="Form control with object"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you will notice is that &lt;code&gt;input&lt;/code&gt; is showing &lt;code&gt;[object] [Object]&lt;/code&gt; in it’s value, because it's a string representation of the object (in our case, it's a member of &lt;code&gt;Telephone&lt;/code&gt; class). To fix &lt;code&gt;input&lt;/code&gt;’s value, we can simply provide the &lt;code&gt;toString()&lt;/code&gt; method in the &lt;code&gt;Telephone&lt;/code&gt; class. You can read more about it on &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/toString"&gt;MDN docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Telephone&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;countryCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;phoneNumber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;toString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;countryCode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;phoneNumber&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;countryCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;phoneNumber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second thing is that &lt;code&gt;FormControl&lt;/code&gt;’s value has the desired &lt;code&gt;Telephone&lt;/code&gt;’s structure initially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, if you modify the &lt;code&gt;input&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;FormControl&lt;/code&gt;’s value will change to &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;. We will need to work on the value conversion from UI to &lt;code&gt;FormControl&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For that, we will create a custom input directive for &lt;code&gt;input[type=tel]&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;code&gt;CustomValueAccessor&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#custom-input-for-telephone"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Custom Input for Telephone
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial code for &lt;code&gt;InputTelDirective&lt;/code&gt; directive looks like below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// src/app/shared/directives/input-tel.directive.ts&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Directive&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@angular/core&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ControlValueAccessor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@angular/forms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Directive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;input[type=tel]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;providers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;provide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;useExisting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;InputTelDirective&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;multi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;InputTelDirective&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ControlValueAccessor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;writeValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;registerOnChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;registerOnTouched&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re new to &lt;code&gt;ControlValueAccessor&lt;/code&gt;, you can read more about it at: &lt;a href="https://indepth.dev/posts/1055/never-again-be-confused-when-implementing-controlvalueaccessor-in-angular-forms"&gt;Never again be confused when implementing ControlValueAccessor in Angular forms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://indepth.dev/posts/1467/how-to-use-controlvalueaccessor-to-enhance-date-input-with-automatic-conversion-and-validation"&gt;How to use ControlValueAccessor to enhance date input with automatic conversion and validation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this example, we are only concerned about &lt;code&gt;writeValue&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;registerOnChange&lt;/code&gt;. Simply put, &lt;code&gt;writeValue&lt;/code&gt; is used to convert &lt;code&gt;FormControl&lt;/code&gt;’s value to UI value and &lt;code&gt;registerOnChange&lt;/code&gt; is used to convert UI value to &lt;code&gt;FormControl&lt;/code&gt;’s value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conversion-from-ui-to-raw-formcontrol-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conversion from UI to &lt;code&gt;FormControl&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to assume that the user will enter the value in this form: &lt;code&gt;+CC-XXXXXX&lt;/code&gt;, where characters before hyphen (-) combine to country-code and the rest is actual contact number. Note that this is not intended to be a robust directive, just something from which we can start learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To handle that, let’s first add a listener on &lt;code&gt;input&lt;/code&gt; event:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;HostListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;$event.target.value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onInput&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, let’s modify the &lt;code&gt;registerOnChange&lt;/code&gt; method:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;registerOnChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;onInput&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;telephoneValues&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;telephone&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Telephone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;telephoneValues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;telephoneValues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;telephone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at the output now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XDiFbhf6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/0DobyB5.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XDiFbhf6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/0DobyB5.gif" alt="Form control with Custom Value Accessor" title="Form control with Custom Value Accessor"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Works nice! It is converting UI value to a valid &lt;code&gt;FormControl&lt;/code&gt;’s value, i.e. &lt;code&gt;Telephone&lt;/code&gt; class’s member.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conversion-from-raw-formcontrol-endraw-to-ui"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conversion from &lt;code&gt;FormControl&lt;/code&gt; to UI
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you try to set the initial state through &lt;code&gt;FormControl&lt;/code&gt;, it won’t reflect on &lt;code&gt;input&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;telephone&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;FormControl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Telephone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;+91&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;1234567890&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s modify the &lt;code&gt;writeValue&lt;/code&gt; method to handle the above:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;writeValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Telephone&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;telephone&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Telephone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_renderer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_elementRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nativeElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;telephone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now the value set through &lt;code&gt;FormControl&lt;/code&gt; will get reflected to &lt;code&gt;input&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#validation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Validation
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we will add the validation part so that input supports validation out-of-the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will first add &lt;code&gt;NG_VALIDATORS&lt;/code&gt; in providers:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// src/app/shared/directives/input-tel.directive.ts&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// …&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Directive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;input[type=tel]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;providers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;provide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;useExisting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;InputTelDirective&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;multi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;provide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;NG_VALIDATORS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;useExisting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;InputTelDirective&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;multi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, we will add &lt;code&gt;isValid&lt;/code&gt; method in &lt;code&gt;Telephone&lt;/code&gt; class to check validity:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Telephone&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;isValid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;countryCode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;phoneNumber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we will implement the &lt;code&gt;Validator&lt;/code&gt; interface and add &lt;code&gt;validate&lt;/code&gt; method:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;InputTelDirective&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ControlValueAccessor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Validator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;validate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AbstractControl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ValidationErrors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;telephone&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Telephone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;telephone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isValid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;telephone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s modify the template to utilize validation:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;app-root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`
    &amp;lt;input
      type="tel"
      name="telephone"
      id="telephone"
      [formControl]="telephone"
      [class.is-invalid]="
        (telephone?.touched || telephone?.dirty) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; telephone?.invalid
      "
    /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div
      class="invalid-feedback"
      *ngIf="(telephone.touched || telephone.dirty) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; telephone.invalid"
    &amp;gt;
      Invalid Telephone
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Value: {{ telephone.value | json }}&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
  `&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AppComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;telephone&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;FormControl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Telephone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's look at the output now:&lt;/p&gt;

  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We learned how we can manage the object in &lt;code&gt;FormControl&lt;/code&gt; and use &lt;code&gt;ControlValueAccessor&lt;/code&gt; to handle the conversion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole code for directive looks like below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Directive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ElementRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HostListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Renderer2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@angular/core&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AbstractControl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ControlValueAccessor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;NG_VALIDATORS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ValidationErrors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Validator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@angular/forms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Directive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;input[type=tel]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;providers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;provide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;useExisting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;InputTelDirective&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;multi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;provide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;NG_VALIDATORS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;useExisting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;InputTelDirective&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;multi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;InputTelDirective&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ControlValueAccessor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Validator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;_elementRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ElementRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;HTMLInputElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;_renderer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Renderer2&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;HostListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;$event.target.value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onInput&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{};&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;registerOnChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;telephone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;registerOnTouched&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Telephone&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;toString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;countryCode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;phoneNumber&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;countryCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;phoneNumber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;isValid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;countryCode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;phoneNumber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I have also created a &lt;a href="https://github.com/shhdharmen/multi-value-form-control"&gt;GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt; for all the code above.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I sat down with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jlengstorf"&gt;Jason Lengstorf&lt;/a&gt; to talk about &lt;a href="https://nextjs.org/docs"&gt;Next.js&lt;/a&gt; and teach him how to generate dynamic routes powered by the &lt;a href="https://graphql.contentful.com/"&gt;Contentful GraphQL API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this video, we cover:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/OWgeN6O707s?t=6"&gt;Intro and a bit about my background&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/OWgeN6O707s?t=172"&gt;What I like about Next.js and Contentful&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/OWgeN6O707s?t=414"&gt;Thoughts on GraphQL vs REST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/OWgeN6O707s?t=735"&gt;GraphQL is more environmentally friendly than REST and making tech more accessible to hobby developers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/OWgeN6O707s?t=866"&gt;Planning today's project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/OWgeN6O707s?t=1231"&gt;Setting up the content model in Contentful&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/OWgeN6O707s?t=1610"&gt;Adding entries to Contentful&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/OWgeN6O707s?t=1894"&gt;Installing the GraphQL Playground app in Contentful&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/OWgeN6O707s?t=2074"&gt;Building the GraphQL query in the GraphQL playground&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/OWgeN6O707s?t=2154"&gt;Creating a new Next.js application and using the GitHub CLI and Netlify CLI to set up environment variables to deploy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/OWgeN6O707s?t=2557"&gt;Using getStaticProps to fetch data for the home page via the Contentful GraphQL API&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/OWgeN6O707s?t=3049"&gt;Building a list of client-side anchor links using next/link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/OWgeN6O707s?t=3172"&gt;Using getStaticPaths to create dynamic routes at build-time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/OWgeN6O707s?t=3744"&gt;Using getStaticProps to fetch data for individual dynamic routes with GraphQL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/OWgeN6O707s?t=4161"&gt;Styling the front end&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/OWgeN6O707s?t=4946"&gt;Deploying the site to Netlify&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a great time on Learn with Jason — and learned a few things along the way, too! I'm excited to speed up my development and deployment process using the &lt;a href="https://cli.netlify.com/"&gt;Netlify CLI&lt;/a&gt; next time I launch a new project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for having me, Jason!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Setup Next.js to use Tailwind with Nx</title>
      <author>Juri Strumpflohner</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Oct 2021 09:16:22 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/nx/setup-next-js-to-use-tailwind-with-nx-4d57</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/nx/setup-next-js-to-use-tailwind-with-nx-4d57</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://juristr.com/blog/2021/06/create-nextjs-webapp-nx"&gt;previous article&lt;/a&gt; we learned how to setup Next.js in an Nx workspace. In this article we carry that forward, by adding &lt;a href="https://tailwindcss.com/"&gt;TailwindCSS&lt;/a&gt; support to our setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that you &lt;strong&gt;don't need to use a preprocessor with Tailwind&lt;/strong&gt; — you typically write very little CSS on a Tailwind project anyways so using a preprocessor just isn't as beneficial as it would be in a project where you write a lot of custom CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The official TailwindCSS docs page already &lt;a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs"&gt;has a guide&lt;/a&gt; on how to setup Tailwind with Next.js. Definitely check that out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#install-and-configure-tailwind-in-an-nx-workspace"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Install and configure Tailwind in an Nx workspace
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step is to install the necessary npm packages.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn add tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next step is to create the &lt;code&gt;tailwind.config.js&lt;/code&gt; as well as &lt;code&gt;postcss.config.js&lt;/code&gt; files. Tailwind already comes with a utility for that. &lt;strong&gt;Note,&lt;/strong&gt; previously we generated our app (named &lt;code&gt;site&lt;/code&gt;) into the &lt;code&gt;apps&lt;/code&gt; folder of Nx. Therefore, when generating the Tailwind configuration, we need to cd into that folder.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;apps/site
npx tailwindcss init &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-p&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That should generate both of the configuration files directly into the root of our Next.js application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you adjust our &lt;code&gt;postcss.config.js&lt;/code&gt; to properly point to our tailwind config file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// apps/site/postcss.config.js&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;plugins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;tailwindcss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;__dirname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;tailwind.config.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;autoprefixer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#include-the-tailwindcss-styles"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Include the TailwindCSS styles
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two options for including the Tailwind CSS files:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Directly import them in the global &lt;code&gt;_app.tsx&lt;/code&gt; component&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include it in the &lt;code&gt;styles.css&lt;/code&gt; css file that gets imported by the &lt;code&gt;_app.tsx&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 1:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open the main Next.js page component &lt;code&gt;_app.tsx&lt;/code&gt; which functions and import the TailwindCSS file instead of &lt;code&gt;styles.css&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;...
import &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'tailwindcss/tailwind.css'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;function &lt;/span&gt;CustomApp&lt;span class="o"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; Component, pageProps &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;: AppProps&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  ...
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;export &lt;/span&gt;default CustomApp&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 2:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open &lt;code&gt;styles.css&lt;/code&gt;, clean all the pre-generated CSS and include the TailwindCSS components there:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;@tailwind&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;base&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;@tailwind&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;@tailwind&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;utilities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;styles.css&lt;/code&gt; gets imported by the &lt;code&gt;_app.tsx&lt;/code&gt; and thus functions as the global CSS file for our Next.js app. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally also in the &lt;code&gt;_app.tsx&lt;/code&gt;, remove the header section as we won't need it right now:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AppProps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;next/app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Head&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;next/head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;./styles.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;CustomApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pageProps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AppProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to site!&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"app"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;pageProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;CustomApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#testing-the-integration"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Testing the integration
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's quickly test whether the TailwindCSS integration works by adding the following to our &lt;code&gt;index.tsx&lt;/code&gt; page component.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// apps/site/pages/index.tsx&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"bg-gray-50"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"max-w-7xl mx-auto py-12 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:py-16 lg:px-8 lg:flex lg:items-center lg:justify-between"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"text-3xl font-extrabold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-4xl"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"block"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Ready to dive in?&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"block text-indigo-600"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"mt-8 flex lg:mt-0 lg:flex-shrink-0"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"inline-flex rounded-md shadow"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="na"&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"#"&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"inline-flex items-center justify-center px-5 py-3 border border-transparent text-base font-medium rounded-md text-white bg-indigo-600 hover:bg-indigo-700"&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              Get started
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"ml-3 inline-flex rounded-md shadow"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="na"&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"#"&lt;/span&gt;

              Learn more
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The result should look like this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QO59zEiR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://juristr.com/blog/assets/imgs/nextjs-nx-series/tailwind-page-preview.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QO59zEiR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://juristr.com/blog/assets/imgs/nextjs-nx-series/tailwind-page-preview.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-do-we-handle-tailwind-config-files-in-a-monorepo"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How do we handle Tailwind config files in a monorepo
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far we've placed the Tailwind config within our app root directory (&lt;code&gt;apps/site&lt;/code&gt;). That makes sense as the app probably knows the Tailwind configs to be designed properly. However, you might also want some more global, cross-app configs. Think about a company design system, where you'll most probably have the same font, maybe even colors etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To have a global Nx workspace-wide config we can leverage &lt;a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/presets"&gt;Tailwind presets&lt;/a&gt;. At the Nx workspace root we define a &lt;code&gt;tailwind-workspace-preset.js&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's add the &lt;a href="https://blog.tailwindcss.com/tailwindcss-typography"&gt;Tailwind Typography package&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;yarn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;tailwindcss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/typograph&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;y
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, we add it to our &lt;code&gt;tailwind-workspace-preset.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// tailwind-workspace-preset.js&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kr"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;extend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;variants&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;extend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;plugins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@tailwindcss/typography&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In order to use the Tailwind preset in our &lt;code&gt;apps/site&lt;/code&gt; specific Tailwind config, we require the file and add it to the &lt;code&gt;presets&lt;/code&gt; array of the config.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// apps/site/tailwind.config.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kr"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;presets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;../../tailwind-workspace-preset.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Note, I've seen people use something like &lt;code&gt;const { appRootPath } = require('@nrwl/workspace/src/utils/app-root');&lt;/code&gt; and then concatenate it with the actual config file, which obviously also works and gets rid of the relative file import. Importing from &lt;code&gt;@nrwl/workspace&lt;/code&gt; should be avoided though, and also it is a deep import of a private API that is subject to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a relative path should be fine here, as the app location will only rarely change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verify that your changes work by adding some paragraphs to your &lt;code&gt;index.tsx&lt;/code&gt;. You can use those mentioned in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography#usage"&gt;Tailwind Typography repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tailwind-css-purging"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tailwind CSS Purging
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main advantages of Tailwind is its CSS purging mechanism that allows reducing the final CSS bundle to only the required parts. As a result, you get a small and optimized CSS file. This happens at compile time using the PostCSS configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, if we run &lt;code&gt;npx nx run site:export&lt;/code&gt;, we'll see that there's quite a large CSS file that gets exported:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VE12q1h8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://juristr.com/blog/assets/imgs/nextjs-nx-series/tailwind-css-unpurged.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VE12q1h8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://juristr.com/blog/assets/imgs/nextjs-nx-series/tailwind-css-unpurged.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because Tailwind during development pulls in all kinds of utility class names which you might never actually need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#configure-css-purging"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Configure CSS Purging
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enable purging, open the &lt;code&gt;tailwind.config.js&lt;/code&gt; for the &lt;code&gt;site&lt;/code&gt; app and add the globs to the &lt;code&gt;purge&lt;/code&gt; property. For our application &lt;code&gt;site&lt;/code&gt; it might look as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// apps/site/tailwind.config.js&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;purge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;__dirname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the particularities and also advantages of Nx is that its setup incentivizes the structuring of your logic into &lt;code&gt;apps&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;libs&lt;/code&gt; (more &lt;a href="https://nx.dev/latest/react/guides/monorepo-nx-enterprise#apps-and-libs"&gt;details on the docs&lt;/a&gt;). As a result, though, our components having Tailwind classes might not only be in the &lt;code&gt;apps/site/**&lt;/code&gt; but also within libraries in the &lt;code&gt;libs/**&lt;/code&gt; folder. Naively we could just add those globs as well, like &lt;code&gt;./libs/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}&lt;/code&gt;. In a large workspace, this might however lead to unnecessary parsing of files since not all libs might be used by our Next app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve this, we can dynamically calculate the glob pattern based on which &lt;code&gt;libs&lt;/code&gt; our Next.js app depends on. &lt;a href="https://nx.dev/latest/react/structure/dependency-graph"&gt;Nx has a dependency graph&lt;/a&gt;, which can not only be used to visualize, but we can also &lt;a href="https://juristr.com/blog/2020/09/use-nx-dep-graph-in-custom-scripts/"&gt;leverage it in our custom scripts&lt;/a&gt;. Luckily we don't have to create our own script since in &lt;strong&gt;Nx v12.4.0&lt;/strong&gt; we added some utility functions that allow us to easily generate glob patterns based on the apps' dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change your &lt;code&gt;tailwind.config.js&lt;/code&gt; to the following:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// apps/site/tailwind.config.js&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// available since Nx v 12.5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createGlobPatternsForDependencies&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@nrwl/next/tailwind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;presets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;../../tailwind-workspace-preset.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;purge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;__dirname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createGlobPatternsForDependencies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;__dirname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;darkMode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;media&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// or 'media' or 'class'&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;extend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;variants&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;extend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;plugins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Note how we import the &lt;code&gt;createGlobPatternsForDependencies&lt;/code&gt; function from &lt;code&gt;@nrwl/next/tailwind&lt;/code&gt; and pass it the current directory. What the function does is simply create a list of paths of potential libs our app depends on. For example, consider we depend on a lib &lt;code&gt;ui&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;core&lt;/code&gt; the resulting generated paths would look like&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Users/y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ourname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;juridev&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;libs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ui&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/**/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;spec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;tsx&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Users&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;yourname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;juridev&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;libs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;core&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/**/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;spec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;tsx&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(The exact path obviously depends on your username, Nx workspace name and operating system)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The glob pattern can be customized by specifying the 2nd parameter of the &lt;code&gt;createGlobPatternsForDependencies&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, to verify the purging works as intended, execute the build or export target on our app (&lt;code&gt;nx run site:build&lt;/code&gt;). The resulting CSS file should be only a couple of KBs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xuJV6VcV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://juristr.com/blog/assets/imgs/nextjs-nx-series/tailwind-css-purged.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xuJV6VcV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://juristr.com/blog/assets/imgs/nextjs-nx-series/tailwind-css-purged.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#enabling-tailwind-jit"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Enabling Tailwind JIT
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since purging only happens at build time when you create the deployable bundle, the amount of CSS to load during development might be huge, depending on which TailwindCSS classes you apply to your HTML elements. This might result in an overall slowdown of the debugging tools (e.g. Chrome Devtools).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To mitigate that, the Tailwind team introduced the JIT mode, which (at the time of writing this article) is an experimental feature that can be turned on by adding the &lt;code&gt;mode: 'jit'&lt;/code&gt; to the Tailwind config&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// apps/site/tailwind.config.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;jit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tailwind's JIT compiler uses its own file watching system, so make sure to set the required environment variables like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;TAILWIND_MODE&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;watch&lt;/code&gt; to get continuous watching as you have the dev server running and change the Tailwind classes. Set it to &lt;code&gt;build&lt;/code&gt; for a one-off compilation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;NODE_ENV&lt;/code&gt; should be set to &lt;code&gt;production&lt;/code&gt; when doing the final build, s.t. the JIT compiler doesn't watch files, but just does a one-off compilation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that Nx already sets the NODE_ENV to production when you build or export your Next.js app (e.g. using &lt;code&gt;nx serve site&lt;/code&gt; ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read all the details about JIT mode on the &lt;a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode"&gt;Tailwind docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>15 Must-Have Browser Extensions for Web Developers</title>
      <author>Code</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Oct 2021 08:57:50 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/coderzs/15-must-have-browser-extensions-for-web-developers-4f28</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/coderzs/15-must-have-browser-extensions-for-web-developers-4f28</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;Browsers are increasingly incorporating more &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;extensions, plugins and add-ons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which are often developed by their users, making the browser more powerful, and helping us increase our productivity. Here at Awwwards, our mission is to share with you the best resources and tools on the web, so we're writing a series of blog articles on &lt;span&gt;the best extensions and plugins for major browsers&lt;/span&gt;. To kick-off, we're focusing on extensions that are offered in the Chrome Web Store, available for free and easy to install.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the tools, we'll highlight those that are&lt;span&gt; most useful for web designers and developers&lt;/span&gt;. We hope you find them useful and get you better results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read More: &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;url=https://www.codelivly.com/chrome-extensions-for-web-developers/&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjNobWsr-fyAhX_yzgGHYoACLUQFnoECAMQBQ&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3LrSRSp_yMsQU7StlCW8qG"&gt;15 Must-Have Browser Extensions for Web Developers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blog site API with Authentication in Node, Express and MongoDB</title>
      <author>Collins Mbathi</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Oct 2021 08:56:11 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/collins87mbathi/blog-site-api-with-authentication-in-node-express-and-mongodb-59h4</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/collins87mbathi/blog-site-api-with-authentication-in-node-express-and-mongodb-59h4</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;we are going to build a Blog site Api which has User Authentication using express, node and MongoDb, the Api  has a simple functionality a since we are using express the framework of Node.js, all the data comes from a MongoDB database, the Api endpoints are coming from Node.js&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setup
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s kick off by starting with the Node.js code. Create a folder and name it Blog site api.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, create a package.json file by entering the &lt;code&gt;npm init-y&lt;/code&gt;command in the terminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, You need to install some packages before starting. &lt;br&gt;
This packages we are going to use them through out the project &lt;br&gt;
Open the terminal and install&lt;br&gt;
Express,Mongoose,dotenv,bcryptjs in the api folder.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm i express mongoose dotenv bcryptjs
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;when the packages are installing create a file and name it &lt;strong&gt;.env&lt;/strong&gt;  after this open the mongoDb and copy the link to link to our project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IXuefnHE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0ih0n1wihl9xjvkark5n.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IXuefnHE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0ih0n1wihl9xjvkark5n.PNG" alt="env"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the url of the mongodb we are going to connect it to the main folder using the dotenv package. the package helps us to separate secrets from the source code .this is useful when you are going to upload your project in github.where you may not want to share your database login credentials with other people.Instead you share the source code.as you can see i have hide my password in the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also i have installed &lt;code&gt;bcryptjs&lt;/code&gt; as seen above. this package allows us to build a password security platform that scales with computation power and always hashes every password with a salt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;lets now create our main file and name it &lt;code&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt; . this is where we will accemble all routes and middleware.Before moving on further lets import nodemon in the api folder ,Whenever&lt;br&gt;
you make any changes to the code in the index.js file, the Node server restarts&lt;br&gt;
instantaneously.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm i nodemon
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#initial-route-setup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Initial Route Setup
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s create the initial route, which generally checks whether everything is set up&lt;br&gt;
correctly. The Express package in Node.js allows you to create routes, which is how most&lt;br&gt;
of the Internet works. Most back-end languages like Node.js, Java offer capabilities to&lt;br&gt;
create these routes, which interact with the databases. The initial route doesn’t interact&lt;br&gt;
with the database and simply returns a text when you go to it, using a GET request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a index.js file in the api folder. Here, you import the Express&lt;br&gt;
and the Mongoose packages first. Next, use Express to create a port variable to run on&lt;br&gt;
the port you will be given or if their are no port then give it port 5000.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const express = require('express');
const mongoose = require('express');
//App Config
const app = express()
const port = process.env.PORT || 5000
//Middleware
//DB Config
//API Endpoints

//Listener
app.listen(port, () =&amp;gt; console.log(`Listening on localhost: ${port}`))

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#database-user-and-network-access"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Database User and Network Access
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In MongoDB, you need to create a database user and provide network access.and connect it to the initial routes  using dotenv since we have stored our link in the .env file&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Y-bEPkk9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/at3bxxcddmwdlck2vf2s.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Y-bEPkk9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/at3bxxcddmwdlck2vf2s.PNG" alt="dotenv"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#database-schema-and-routes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Database Schema and Routes
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The database we are using MongoDB stores data in a JSON format instead of the regular table structure found in a&lt;br&gt;
traditional database like Oracle. You create the schema file required by MongoDB. It tells&lt;br&gt;
you how fields are stored in MongoDB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First create a folder and name it models .Inside the folder create and file and name it &lt;code&gt;User.js&lt;/code&gt; this is where we are going to write our Authentication schema&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#auth-schema"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Auth Schema
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to start by creating the authentication Schema for users where when one registers into the site. The user details are stored in the data base. So that when the user comes later they will jus login since the server will recognize them through their details that were saved.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
     username:{
         type:String,
         required:true,
         unique:true,
         min:3,
         max:20
     },
     email:{
        type:String,
         required:true,
         unique:true

     },
     password:{
        type:String,
        required:true,
        min:3,
        max:10
     },

},

{timestamps: true}

);

module.exports = mongoose.model("User", UserSchema);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;also as seen in the code above in the last line we have exported our code so as to import it in the routes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as you can see the schema contains details such as username,email and password they are going to be stored in the database..so when the user tries to login, The server will check if the user exist in the database and  allows the user, if user details are in the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;lets know create the Post Schema where we are going to store what we want to be in our post &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the models folder create a file and name it &lt;code&gt;Post.js&lt;/code&gt; this is where we are going to write our Post Schema.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const PostSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
 desc : {
     type:String,
     required:true,

 },
 title : {
     type:String,
     required:true,

 }


},
{timestamps: true}
);

module.exports = mongoose.model('Post', PostSchema);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our post schema contains title and  description which are going to be stored in the database &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You now use the schema to create the endpoint that adds data to the database. The&lt;br&gt;
MVC pattern is followed here; it is the traditional flow of a web application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, use a POST request that takes any data from the user and sends it to the&lt;br&gt;
database. You can use any endpoint. For example, if you write an article on Dev.to&lt;br&gt;
and hit the POST button, your article is saved in the Dev.to database once the POST&lt;br&gt;
request is made.&lt;br&gt;
The GET endpoints fetch all the data from the database. Again, you can give any&lt;br&gt;
endpoint. For example, when you browse through the posts in Dev.to, a GET request is&lt;br&gt;
sent to the endpoint, which in turn fetches all posts from the Dev.to database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#routes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  routes
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;create a folder and name it routes. First we are going to start with the Authentication route. In the routes folder create a file and name it &lt;code&gt;Auth.js&lt;/code&gt; this are the codes of the authentication below&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const router = require('express').Router();

const User = require('../models/User');

const bcrypt = require('bcryptjs')


//register end point
router.post('/register', async (req,res)=&amp;gt; {


   // const confirm = await User.find({Username : req.body.username ,email : req.body.email})
    //confirm &amp;amp;&amp;amp; res.status(400).json('this user or email exist');
    try {
    const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(10);
    const hashedPass = await bcrypt.hash(req.body.password, salt);

const savedPost = await new User({
        username: req.body.username,
        email: req.body.email,
        password : hashedPass       

})

     const resultPost = await savedPost.save()

     res.status(200).json(resultPost);
  } catch (error) {
     res.status(500).json(error); 
  }

})


//login endpoint
router.post('/login', async (req,res)=&amp;gt;{

    try {
        const user = await User.findOne({username : req.body.username});
        !user &amp;amp;&amp;amp; res.status(400).json('wrong user');

        const validate = await bcrypt.compare(req.body.password,user.password);
        !validate &amp;amp;&amp;amp; res.status(400).json('wrong password');

        const {password, ...others} = user._doc;

        res.status(200).json(others);


    } catch (error) {
       res.status(500).json(error); 
    }




})







module.exports = router;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the code above we have imported the schema and we are going to use it to insert the details and save it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;create a POST request to the /register endpoint. The load is&lt;br&gt;
in req.body.username,password,email to MongoDB. Then you use &lt;code&gt;New&lt;/code&gt; method to send the User details. If it’s a success, you&lt;br&gt;
receive status 200; otherwise, you receive status 500. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, create the post endpoint to /login to get the data from the database.&lt;br&gt;
You are using findOne() here and receive a status 200 on success (otherwise, status 500).&lt;br&gt;
Also in the code we have used the bcryptjs to protect our passwords as indicated above .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets go to the Post routes ,In the routes folder create a file and name it &lt;code&gt;Post.js&lt;/code&gt; the codes of the Post file are indicated below&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const router = require('express').Router();
const Post = require('../models/Post');

//create post 
router.post('/', async (req,res)=&amp;gt; {
try {
    const savePost = await new Post(req.body);
    const savedPost = await savePost.save()
    res.status(200).json(savedPost);

} catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json(error);
}

})
//update post
router.put('/:id', async (req,res)=&amp;gt; {
 try {
    const post = await Post.findById(req.params.id);
    if(post.userId === req.body.userId) {
      await Post.updateOne({$set:req.body});
      res.status(200).json('it has been updated');

    } else {
        res.status(403).json('you can only update your post');
    }
 } catch (error) {
     res.status(500).json(error)
 }

})


//delete post 
router.delete('/:id', async (req, res)=&amp;gt; {
  try {
   const post =  await Post.findById(req.params.id);
   if (post.userId === req.body.userId) {
      await Post.deleteOne()
      res.status(200).json('the post is deleted')
   } else {
       res.status(403).json("you can only delete your post")
   }
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json(error)  
  }

})

//get All posts 
router.get('/', async (req,res) =&amp;gt; {
  try {
   const posts = await Post.find();
  res.status(200).json(posts);

  } catch (error) {
   res.status(500).json(error); 
  }


})

//get one post 
router.get('/:id',async(req,res)=&amp;gt; {

  try {
    const post = await Post.findById(req.params.id);
    res.status(200).json(post);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json(error);
  }


})



module.exports = router;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In our code above we have created our post, saved it ,able to edit it ,able to delete it and able to get all the post or one post&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;first we use the &lt;code&gt;post&lt;/code&gt; method to create the post and save it as indicated. we used the &lt;code&gt;put&lt;/code&gt; method to be able to edit the post where we find the post using its &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; by using &lt;code&gt;findById&lt;/code&gt;method provide by the mongoose package after finding it we use &lt;code&gt;updateOne&lt;/code&gt; method to update the post. &lt;br&gt;
in the third method we use the &lt;code&gt;delete&lt;/code&gt;. where we find the post we want to delete using the findById method and use the deleteOne() to delete the post &lt;br&gt;
..&lt;br&gt;
also the &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; method is done the similar way use the first get to find only one post and the second to get all the post &lt;br&gt;
in the last line of our code we have exported our code using router. this helps us to be able to track our handle request easily and send it to the main file index.js let me show you in the screenshot below&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NpGVzr3A--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pdj7np1huo8r7e8x9wry.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NpGVzr3A--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pdj7np1huo8r7e8x9wry.PNG" alt="index"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as you can see in the above screenshot we can now access out routes as middleware using &lt;code&gt;use()&lt;/code&gt; function  we import our codes the router function helps us to import easily.&lt;br&gt;
example &lt;code&gt;import authroute = require('./routes/Auth');&lt;/code&gt;. we have imported our route&lt;br&gt;
 as shown we create the end point &lt;code&gt;/api/blog&lt;/code&gt; and the router in the end.&lt;br&gt;
Before i forget we add the express.json() middleware since our data are in json  so is a method inbuilt in express to recognize the incoming Request Object as a JSON Object. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading the article hope you learn alot from it in the next article we are going to learn how to test it in Postman Software.&lt;/p&gt;

Protect S3 buckets
with AWS Macie</title>
      <author>Bruno Schaatsbergen</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Oct 2021 08:56:05 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/aws-builders/protect-s3-buckets-with-aws-macie-16gm</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/aws-builders/protect-s3-buckets-with-aws-macie-16gm</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lets discover how we can use machine learning and pattern matching at scale to discover and report sensitive data stored in S3. Lets also notify our DevSec team about it by using EventBridge and Lambda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately sloppy access behaviour and exposed PII data in Amazon S3 is responsible for 7% of all data breaches. This often happens due to lack of knowledge or rushing the creation of an S3 bucket. It's easy to leave gaps open in your security layer without having all required knowledge. Lets figure out a way how we can minimize the risk of leaving such flaws in our access layer by using AWS Macie. The intention of this exercise is to setup, detect and report anomalies in access behaviour and sensitive data that's exposed through S3. We also would like to notify our DevSec team about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Ap5U3uj7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6k2fc4a0uqkq4ie1p2aa.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Ap5U3uj7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6k2fc4a0uqkq4ie1p2aa.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#let-me-introduce-aws-macie-first"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Let me introduce AWS Macie first
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Macie is trained and designed to continually scan S3 buckets looking for sensitive information by using fine-grained machine learning algorithms. It also keeps track of anomalous behaviour on files, deletion of audit trails and poor security practices defined in policies. As protecting data at scale can become increasingly complex, expensive, and time-consuming this sounds like a great tool to have under your belt, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you plan to roll out AWS Macie it's important to note that it only integrates with AWS S3 so far, but more is on the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#enabling-it-is-a-piece-of-cake"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Enabling it is a piece of cake
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin with, we need to setup an AWS Macie account. This is simple and straight-forward, terraform provides us with the macie2 client in order to create Macie resources (be aware the integration is quite new, so not everything is supported).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight hcl"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resource&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"aws_macie2_account"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"this"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"ENABLED"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Apply the preceding terraform gist to enable AWS Macie on your account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#managedcustom-data-identifiers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Managed/Custom data identifiers
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before starting to create an AWS Macie detection job, it's good to know that by default a detection job inherits all the managed data identifiers. Macie uses certain criteria and techniques, including machine learning and pattern matching, to detect sensitive data or anomalies. These 'criteria and techniques' are typically referred to as managed data identifiers. There's managed data identifiers for all kinds of categories, think of financial information, personal health information, credentials, etc. There's also a possibility to create your own data identifiers, these are so called custom data identifiers. It consist of a regex to perform a pattern match and a proximity rule to refine the result. I advice that you read up on these yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aws-macie-detection-jobs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AWS Macie detection jobs
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Macie, we have to create and run detection jobs to automate detection, logging, and reporting of sensitive data in S3 buckets. Jobs are responsible for analyzing objects in S3 buckets to determine whether it contains sensitive data or anomalies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every job is associated with 1 or more S3 buckets by either passing in a list of bucket names or by targeting specific tags or other bucket properties. We also have to setup the schedule and scope of the job, e.g. run once every 24 hours and refine your search to only focus on OpenSSH private keys and social insurance numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time to create a bucket and copy some of sensitive data files over. I prepared a few files containing AWS secret keys and sensitive employee data.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight hcl"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resource&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"aws_s3_bucket"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"this"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;bucket&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"demo-macie-detection-bucket"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;acl&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"private"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After applying the above s3.tf we can upload some sensitive data to our bucket for the sake of testing. This should be simple for Macie to detect, I hope.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cat &lt;/span&gt;files/employee.txt 
Jane Doe
100 Main Street, Anytown, USA

John Doe
123 Any Street, Any Town, USA

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cat &lt;/span&gt;files/credentials.txt 
&lt;span class="c"&gt;#Fake AWS Credentials&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;aws s3 &lt;span class="nb"&gt;cp &lt;/span&gt;files s3://demo-macie-detection-bucket &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--recursive&lt;/span&gt;
upload: files/apikeys.txt to s3://demo-macie-detection-bucket/apikeys.txt
upload: files/credentials.txt to s3://demo-macie-detection-bucket/credentials.txt
upload: files/patent.txt to s3://demo-macie-detection-bucket/patent.txt
upload: files/financial.txt to s3://demo-macie-detection-bucket/financial.txt
upload: files/employee.txt to s3://demo-macie-detection-bucket/employee.txt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;aws s3 cp --recursive, a useful command to recursively copy the content of a directory over to an S3 bucket. Another neat trick to add to your toolbelt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we got our bucket and sample data in place it's time to setup the Macie detection job. Lets take a stab at explaining the below terraform resource: job_type indicates that it's a job running by a schedule_frequency, which means it runs by a specific interval (in our case daily). And we use the s3_job_definition to target specific S3 buckets, in our case the one we defined in s3.tf above here.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight hcl"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"aws_caller_identity"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"current"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resource&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"aws_macie2_classification_job"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"this"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;job_type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"SCHEDULED"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"demo-macie-detection-job"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;schedule_frequency&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;daily_schedule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"true"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;s3_job_definition&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;bucket_definitions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;account_id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;aws_caller_identity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;account_id&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;buckets&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;aws_s3_bucket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;depends_on&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;aws_macie2_account&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This job will simply run against the buckets defined in bucket_definitions every day and use all managed data identifiers to analyze the objects in S3. Every anomaly is reported as a Macie Finding by Macie and extensively described in a report per finding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tying-macie-together-with-eventbridge"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tying Macie together with Eventbridge
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now having Macie find and report 'Macie Findings' is great, but I also want to notify our internal DevSec team about the finding. Macie produces events when Macie Findings happen, these are captures by CloudTrail. This allows us to capture it with an EventBridge rule, nice! Time to set one up.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight hcl"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resource&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"aws_cloudwatch_event_rule"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"this"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"demo-macie-slack-notifer-event-rule"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Rule that captures AWS Macie findings"&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event_pattern&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;EOF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sh"&gt;
{
  "source": ["aws.macie"],
  "detail-type": ["Macie Finding"]
}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;EOF
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resource&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"aws_cloudwatch_event_target"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"this"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;rule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;aws_cloudwatch_event_rule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arn&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;aws_lambda_function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arn&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;depends_on&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;aws_lambda_function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This will intercept every Macie Findings event. We can use this aws_cloudwatch_event_rule resource later to somehow make it end up in our DevSec team there slack channel. I'm sure they would love that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lambda-and-slack"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Lambda and Slack
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets put an end to this exercise. Everything is in place, the sample data, our detection job and an event to capture the result of the detection job. As you know by now, I have a weakness for Lambda functions, I use them left and right in every project. Anyways, I created a Slack workspace, Slack app and added the app to a Slack channel called '#aws-macie-events'. I also took a little dive in the Slack API documentation to pull some Python code together that sends details of the Macie finding to the channel.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#!/usr/bin/python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;logging&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;logging&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getLogger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;setLevel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;level&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getenv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"LOG_LEVEL"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"INFO"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;globalVars&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;globalVars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"SLACK_TOKEN"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getenv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"SLACK_TOKEN"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;globalVars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"SLACK_CHANNEL"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getenv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"SLACK_CHANNEL"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;_format_divider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;"type"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"divider"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;post_message_to_slack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;blocks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

                        &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="s"&gt;"url"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://api.slack.com/block-kit"&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;_format_divider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;post_message_to_slack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;policy_blocks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'Response: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"__main__"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;lambda_handler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Take some time to go through the code, it's fairly straight-forward, it reads some properties from the event and wraps it in a neat little message to then send it through the client. Voilà, no rocket science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lambda-and-terraform"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Lambda and Terraform
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a few things we need to create in order to tie all of this together and make it work. Think of declaring the Lambda function in terraform, an IAM role, IAM policies, a log group and hook up the EventBridge event to the Lambda function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets start with defining the Lambda function, I'm using a module from @rojopolis called terraform-aws-lambda-python-archive to zip and install the dependencies. It only requires a path to the Python source code, the module generates a hash based of the source code and uses it to measure changes against.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight hcl"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;locals&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;function_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"demo-macie-slack-notifier-function"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"lambda-python-archive"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"rojopolis/lambda-python-archive/aws"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;version&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"0.1.6"&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;src_dir&lt;/span&gt;              &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"${path.module}/lambda/macie-slack-notifier"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;output_path&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"${path.module}/lambda/macie-slack-notifier.zip"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;install_dependencies&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resource&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"aws_lambda_function"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"this"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;lambda&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;archive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;archive_path&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;source_code_hash&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;lambda&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;archive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;source_code_hash&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;function_name&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;local&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;function_name&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Notifies a given slack channel with AWS Macie findings"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;role&lt;/span&gt;             &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;aws_iam_role&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arn&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handler&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"lambda_function.lambda_handler"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;architectures&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"arm64"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;runtime&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"python3.9"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;timeout&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;300&lt;/span&gt;

 &lt;span class="nx"&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;variables&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;LOG_LEVEL&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"INFO"&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;SLACK_TOKEN&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;                  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Recommended to resolve the slack token via ssm or vault.&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;SLACK_CHANNEL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"#aws-macie-events"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Move this to variables if you feel like.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;depends_on&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;aws_iam_role_policy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;this_cloudwatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;aws_cloudwatch_log_group&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Carefully look at the preceding lambda.tf gist. It should be easy to understand as long as you keep in mind that the module points to the directory containing the source code (just one file callde lambda_function.py).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we log the event and the Slack API call its response we need to create a log group for the Lambda function in order to make this visible. I've made this part of the lambda.tf file but I'm showing it separately here.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight hcl"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resource&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"aws_cloudwatch_log_group"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"this"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;              &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"/aws/lambda/${local.function_name}"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;retention_in_days&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It's good to point out that Cloudwatch log groups should always reflect the name of the Lambda function properly, therefor we are using this local.function_name reference defined at the top of lambda.tf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets wrap it up by creating an IAM role for the Lambda function and the necessary IAM policies that will be attached to the IAM role.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight hcl"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resource&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"aws_iam_role"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"this"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"demo-macie-slack-notifer-lambda-role"&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;assume_role_policy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;EOF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sh"&gt;
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "lambda.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Sid": ""
    }
  ]
}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;EOF
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resource&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"aws_iam_role_policy"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"this_lambda"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"demo-macie-slack-notifer-lambda-policy"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;role&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;aws_iam_role&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;policy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;EOF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sh"&gt;
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowInvokeItself",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "lambda:InvokeFunction"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "${aws_lambda_function.this.arn}"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;EOF
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resource&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"aws_iam_role_policy"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"this_cloudwatch"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"demo-macie-slack-notifer-cw-policy"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;role&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;aws_iam_role&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;policy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;EOF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sh"&gt;
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowCloudWatchLogs",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "logs:CreateLogGroup",
        "logs:CreateLogStream",
        "logs:PutLogEvents"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "${aws_cloudwatch_log_group.this.arn}:*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;EOF
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The preceding iam.tf gist is responsible for creating a role and policies that are needed for the Lambda function to invoke itself and write logs to Cloudwatch. We'll also need to give the EventBridge rule permission to call our Lambda function, lets add that resource to the lambda.tf file. For the sake of the blog I've made a separate gist.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight hcl"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resource&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"aws_lambda_permission"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"this"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;statement_id&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"AllowExecutionFromCloudWatch"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;action&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"lambda:InvokeFunction"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;function_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;aws_lambda_function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;function_name&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;principal&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"events.amazonaws.com"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;source_arn&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;aws_cloudwatch_event_rule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arn&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Great, all of our resources are ready to be applied. Go ahead and run terraform apply to create everything. Once the Macie detection job is created it will immediately start running, so be sure that you've already applied the S3 bucket earlier on and imported the sample data into it. If you forget about this, just comment out some of the resources and apply the S3 bucket first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Macie detected its first Macie finding it should be written to your Slack channel as below (if you've created and added a Slack bot to the channel, be aware of the OAuth token with chat:write.customize scope you need to create, this token is passed down as an environment variable in lambda.tf):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--by_UoemW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/l0ingkvz1yasj2r78006.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--by_UoemW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/l0ingkvz1yasj2r78006.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The preceding image shows a sensitive data finding from Macie, these are categorized under a category called 'classification'. In the below image Macie also found a policy issue, someone removed the encryption from a bucket. The policy findings are categorized under the category 'policy'. Feel free to alter the Python code to log other information in the Slack message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YqCaHlws--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/god0jtnt92k4vwi8herh.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YqCaHlws--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/god0jtnt92k4vwi8herh.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy days, our DevSec team is notified about a security issue by a fancy message 🚨. Besides a working Macie setup that finds us potential issues, it's always important to add such visibility in order to make everyone aware.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;NFT instagram app prototype based on React JS. Images may load slowly since they are quite big. Random images that i could find online, are used. Did not check for copyrights :).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Link to app,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://instagram-nft-app-c1yfmg5x1-benjamin-c.vercel.app/"&gt;https://instagram-nft-app-c1yfmg5x1-benjamin-c.vercel.app/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
