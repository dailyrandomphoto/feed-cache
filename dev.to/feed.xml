      <title>How and when to override Android Activity's Lifecycle methods?</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read this article on &lt;a href="https://genicsblog.com/how-and-when-to-override-android-activity-lifecycle-methods"&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt; for a better experience :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I came across a &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69064102/how-can-i-stop-the-progressdialog-after-returning-to-the-activity"&gt;StackOverflow question&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OP(original poster) of the article had a scenario like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He made a &lt;code&gt;ProgressDialog&lt;/code&gt; in an activity. After pressing a &lt;code&gt;CardView&lt;/code&gt; in that activity corresponding to a meditation session, a &lt;code&gt;ProgressDialog&lt;/code&gt; should appear for 3 seconds, and then the other activity would open - the &lt;code&gt;m1&lt;/code&gt; activity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem he faced was - After returning to &lt;code&gt;MeditationActivity&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;ProgressDialog&lt;/code&gt; continued to show up and never stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He wanted that the progress dialog is closed once the user comes back from the &lt;code&gt;m1&lt;/code&gt; activity to the &lt;code&gt;MeditationActivity&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just after reading the question, it should strike to the mind that one can override the default methods present in an Activity's Lifecycle and dismiss the dialog from there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's how the lifecycle of an Android Activity looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yxje01ct--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630915330208/6F9zSmseW2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yxje01ct--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630915330208/6F9zSmseW2.png" alt="activity_lifecycle.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is an image from the official &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/activity-lifecycle"&gt;android documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the flowchart, we can see that it is the &lt;code&gt;onResume()&lt;/code&gt; method that is called whenever a person comes back to the activity from another screen. So it seems to be the place where we should place the logic for dismissing the dialog!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--b0zdsn9N--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630915509631/Eq9kO4b_9.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--b0zdsn9N--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630915509631/Eq9kO4b_9.png" alt="activity_lifecycle.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's how we can do that:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;onResume&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;onResume&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;progressDialog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;progressDialog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;dismiss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The null check is placed because the &lt;code&gt;progressDialog&lt;/code&gt; was initialized only when the person presses the &lt;code&gt;CardView&lt;/code&gt;. And if it is initialized earlier, then there would be redundant dismissals of the &lt;code&gt;progressDialog&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a perfect example where we could override the default lifecycle methods provided by an Android &lt;code&gt;Activity&lt;/code&gt; to perform actions pertaining to lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/69064294/9819031"&gt;Here's my answer&lt;/a&gt; to the original question on StackOverflow! I'll be writing more explanations to StackOverflow Questions, so consider following me on hashnode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you find this article helpful :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introducing Medusa: Your building blocks for amazing digital commerce experiences</title>
      <author>Sebastian Rindom</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Sep 2021 08:02:18 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/medusajs/introducing-medusa-your-building-blocks-for-amazing-digital-commerce-experiences-4nhp</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/medusajs/introducing-medusa-your-building-blocks-for-amazing-digital-commerce-experiences-4nhp</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of years we have developed Medusa in close collaboration with customers that needed a headless solution that could support their growth for years to come. We are so excited to finally open up about what it is we have built, why we have built it, and how you can succeed with Medusa. Medusa is an open-source headless commerce engine that can power amazing digital commerce experiences and it is a great choice for any new headless ecommerce project out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Headless ecommere has gained plenty of interest recently and more and more businesses are looking towards making the shift to a headless solution to leverage a more modular setup and all the benefits it brings, such as: better page performance, greater flexibility, better support for unique customer experiences, support for best-in-breed tech stacks, etc. When we first started working on Medusa we had no idea what headless ecommerce meant, and initially, we set out to build a fully-fledged platform, but more on this later!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first blog post we are publishing and it will stand as an important milestone for our work going forward. We have found that through modularity and simplicity our merchants end up being able to do much more with much less, which is why we will keep pursuing this approach when building out our product further. We want to provide a foundational set of building blocks that can be used to create unique, interesting, and powerful digital commerce experiences and we are so excited to see what amazing work we can help create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-we-built%C2%A0medusa"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why we built Medusa
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn’t wake up one morning thinking to ourselves that we wanted to build a headless commerce engine, but rather we got to build Medusa through experience with the limitations of existing platforms. Before transitioning to working full-time on Medusa, we operated as an agency, building all kinds of tools for our customers. We built everything from portfolio websites to custom integrations to ecommerce websites, but quickly started specializing in the latter; as we found new customers we also experienced that many of them were hitting limitations with the platforms available at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This became evident when a client of ours expressed interest in switching platforms. We started looking for good alternatives but it quickly became clear that none of them would support the expansion across markets and brand ownership that they required so we decided with them that we should try to build a bespoke solution that would cater to their exact needs and so we began building a fully-fledged ecommerce platform with a CMS system, fulfilment system, etc. It was not soon after that we realized that we couldn’t do everything well at once so we started removing parts of what we’d built and replacing them with integrations to better tools. In the end, we were left with a core that was capable of processing and managing orders, ensuring payments were going through, and handling basic product and customer data. What was even more important was that this core was extremely good at integrating other tools and as such able to function as the glue between all the tools and services in your ecommerce stack. Essentially we had built a headless ecommerce engine, simply by following what was easiest for us as developers and most cost-efficient and scalable for our customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our customers were really happy with the solution as they were able to expand to multiple markets while picking and choosing from any services they found interesting without having to worry about the cost of integration. Furthermore, our customers got a high degree of ownership when using our custom-built solution, as they could ask us to build features that they needed and have them released typically within a couple of days. When contemplating how we could ensure the same level of ownership going forward it became clear that we had to open-source the solution so that no central organization would ever be in control of what was possible for the merchant. Open-sourcing Medusa would also bring a bunch of other benefits such as leveraging the community for feedback and contributions which further strengthens the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After experiencing the issues with the existing platforms we were confident that our product would be a good alternative for many new ecommerce projects and shortly after we decided to open-source the product we started pulling out the generic parts of the implementations we had done, gave it the name Medusa and made it available through GitHub. &lt;a href="https://github.com/medusajs/medusa"&gt;Go to Github to view the open source project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#headless-the-next-generation-of%C2%A0commerce"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Headless: The next generation of commerce
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early days of the internet operating ecommerce required big budgets and with customers still being new to the digital purchasing experience, only a small group of large enterprises set up online commerce channels by either building them from scratch or using solutions like Hybris. As more customers moved online, new platforms as Magento, Shopify, and WooCommerce emerged — these were easy to use and enabled merchants to make digital commerce available as a secondary sales channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, ecommerce has become a primary channel for many businesses leading to fierce competition in the space, increasing the need for custom solutions to give unique buying experiences. In the quest for customization, many businesses have been left frustrated with the lack of flexibility that existing platforms provide. While optimizing for ease of use, most traditional platforms is putting their focus on templated “out-of-the-box” solutions neglecting the constraints this inevitably put on the development flexibility. In many cases, businesses have been forced to converge towards compromised solutions, or even make entire platform shifts, as their needs grow beyond what a templated solution can offer. Simultaneously, a much wider variety of businesses (e.g. service providers, B2B companies etc.) requiring fully custom solutions from the beginning have started moving online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increasing demand for customization and flexibility has spurred an interest in headless commerce among performance-focused merchants that want differentiated and fully optimized customer experiences. Yet, many of them are still to make the move. One of the main reasons, why headless has yet to become the dominant type of ecommerce is that it can be expensive to operate a headless ecommerce stack as you need developers that can maintain the infrastructure that powers the integrations between systems in your stack and a high up-front investment for making the initial setup. This is something we are solving with Medusa by providing infrastructure that is preconfigured and optimized to run your projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#putting-the-developer-first-in-your-commerce%C2%A0setup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Putting the developer first in your commerce setup
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modularity and ownership that Medusa can offer is capable of powering incredibly diverse applications ranging from ecommerce websites to more niche cases like in-restaurant experiences and will with high probability be suitable for whatever digital commerce experience you can think of. Many businesses postpone the transition to headless as it can seem daunting and complex when you need developers to maintain your infrastructure and operations; we will make it possible to take out these concerns completely by providing the infrastructure that is configured and optimized to run Medusa projects, thereby making it much cheaper and more accessible for businesses to make the transition to headless early on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In more general terms we will be focusing on enabling the developer to do much more with less; this is in line with making sure that merchants can take ownership of their commerce setup as developers can help steer the direction and roadmap for your project without relying on us to create the features you need. By creating powerful tools for the developer we enable them to be more efficient and focused in their work. Examples of tools that we are building are; an infrastructure platform so developers don’t have to configure servers and databases, a powerful CLI that automates the redundant tasks developers face, a React component library to make it easy to build storefronts for Medusa, rich documentation that makes it easy to find what you are looking for and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the core project being open-source we will also be open for contributions from the community making sure that we always have a product that is loved by developers so that they can do more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#whats-next"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;What’s next?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are working hard on completing our infrastructure product so that projects can easily be deployed to the cloud. In the meantime, if you are a developer we encourage you to try out Medusa, you can get up and running within 5 minutes and get a quick overview of what features our platform will bring. &lt;a href="https://docs.medusa-commerce.com/tutorial/set-up-your-development-environment"&gt;Check out the tutorial to get started now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a merchant looking for a new solution we would love to get in touch and discuss what challenges we can help solve and guide you through our process.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>🤷‍♂️ 🤷‍♀️ Vue 3 error with using TypeScript: property X does not exist on type 'EventTarget'</title>

      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey, DEV people! 👋 It's time to continue the &lt;strong&gt;Simple Errors&lt;/strong&gt; series with an article about the &lt;strong&gt;TypeScript&lt;/strong&gt; error I encountered when I first decided to convert my &lt;a href="https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html"&gt;Vue.js&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;v3.x&lt;/code&gt; project from regular &lt;strong&gt;JavaScript&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, don't judge too harshly, write what you think of such articles, suggest your own topics for parsing in the comments... Here we go! 🚀&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#table-of-contents"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  📝 Table of contents
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#explanation-of-the-error"&gt;Explanation of the error&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#input-data-when-an-error-occurs"&gt;Input data when an error occurs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#resolving-the-error"&gt;Resolving the error&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#conclusions"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#explanation-of-the-error"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Explanation of the error
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I run &lt;code&gt;vue-tsc --noEmit&lt;/code&gt; to check TypeScript, I get errors:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight console"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="go"&gt;src/components/forms/Input.vue:4:40 - error TS2531: 
Object is possibly 'null'.

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;4     @input="$&lt;/span&gt;emit&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'update:modelValue'&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$event&lt;/span&gt;.target.value&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="go"&gt;                                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

src/components/forms/Input.vue:4:54 - error TS2339: 
Property 'value' does not exist on type 'EventTarget'.

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;4     @input="$&lt;/span&gt;emit&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'update:modelValue'&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$event&lt;/span&gt;.target.value&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="go"&gt;                                                       ~~~~~

Found 2 errors.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While I knew what was wrong with error &lt;code&gt;Object is possibly 'null'&lt;/code&gt;, I had to dig deep into the documentation to find the reason for error &lt;code&gt;Property 'value' does not exist on type 'EventTarget'&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#toc"&gt;↑ Table of contents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#input-data-when-an-error-occurs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Input data when an error occurs
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Vue component (&lt;code&gt;src/components/forms/Input.vue&lt;/code&gt;) looks like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight vue"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"px-3 py-2 border-2 rounded-lg"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="err"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;input=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"$emit('update:modelValue', $event.target.value)"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;:type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"inputType"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;:tabindex=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"tabIndex"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;:placeholder=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"placeholder"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;:value=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"modelValue"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;:required=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"isRequired"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;lang=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"ts"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;defineComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;vue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;defineComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;inputType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;required&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;tabIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;required&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;placeholder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;modelValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;isRequired&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Boolean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you've already noticed, in the &lt;code&gt;@input&lt;/code&gt; attribute of the template, I refer to &lt;code&gt;$event.target.value&lt;/code&gt; as I would do in regular JavaScript. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🤔 &lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Even if &lt;code&gt;$event.target&lt;/code&gt; return &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;, which has no &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; property, this is not &lt;em&gt;a big problem&lt;/em&gt; for regular JavaScript! It will give a run-time error on the client and this web application will crash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that's not how TypeScript works. It checks all possible problematic places in the code at the time of building the project and points them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That's why we love and use it!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#toc"&gt;↑ Table of contents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--G_Ue6BQn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/z11642wyh1kar7n8vtfy.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--G_Ue6BQn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/z11642wyh1kar7n8vtfy.jpg" alt="solve the problem"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#resolving-the-error"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Resolving the error
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, write a new method called &lt;code&gt;handleInputChange(event)&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;a href="https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/composition-api-setup.html"&gt;setup&lt;/a&gt; function:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight vue"&gt;&lt;code&gt;// ...

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;lang=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"ts"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;defineComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;vue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;defineComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Define event handler for input changes in TypeScript.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleInputChange&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HTMLInputElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleInputChange&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In TypeScript, we need to explicitly point to the object we want to work with. In this case, it is the &lt;code&gt;input&lt;/code&gt; field, so its object will be called &lt;code&gt;HTMLInputElement&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;☝️ &lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement"&gt;HTMLInputElement&lt;/a&gt; interface provides special properties and methods for manipulating the options, layout, and presentation of &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, let's add this method to the &lt;code&gt;@input&lt;/code&gt; in our template, like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight vue"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"px-3 py-2 border-2 rounded-lg"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="err"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;input=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"$emit('update:modelValue', handleInputChange($event))"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;:type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"inputType"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;:tabindex=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"tabIndex"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;:placeholder=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"placeholder"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;:value=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"modelValue"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;:required=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"isRequired"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

// ...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;vue-tsc&lt;/code&gt; once again... and boom! 💥 All errors disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#toc"&gt;↑ Table of contents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know how difficult it is to retrain to a new paradigm of interaction with the same objects and properties! But this simple error showed me just how powerful and useful &lt;a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/"&gt;TypeScript&lt;/a&gt; is in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a successful work and let simple errors &lt;strong&gt;never stop you&lt;/strong&gt; on the way to realizing your projects! 😉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#toc"&gt;↑ Table of contents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#photos-and-videos-by"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Photos and videos by
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;

      <title>Dev tool: A project built to boost your Skills and Productivity 💫</title>
      <author>Anthony Lagrede</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Sep 2021 07:45:11 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/alagrede/dev-tool-a-project-built-to-boost-your-skills-and-productivity-29j8</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/alagrede/dev-tool-a-project-built-to-boost-your-skills-and-productivity-29j8</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I'm pleased to announce the Znote 1.0 💫, a super versatile Markdown code editor! 🎉🎉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shared with the Dev.to community in 2020, 🥰 the positive  &lt;a href="https://dev.to/alagrede/dev-tool-a-markdown-editor-for-developers-1j13"&gt;feedback&lt;/a&gt; I received since then motivates me to push forward (many thanks again 🙏). I'm coming after months of HARD WORK, with a robust version dedicated to all your daily code usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#reminder-what-is-znote"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Reminder: What is Znote
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Znote is a Markdown editor, designed to be your best companion 🫂 for prototyping and making scripts. The missing piece for JS developers in data exploration, offering a solid alternative to &lt;strong&gt;Jupyter&lt;/strong&gt; in the Python ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-approach"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The approach
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Promulgate an innovative and empirical approach that consists to &lt;strong&gt;write code and documentation in the same place&lt;/strong&gt;. In this app, you can quickly play code block, exploiting results, and put around all the necessary information in Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easier to read and share than a raw code script, you will take pleasure to organize and share your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1oE5pTQV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fa6hlrr49870ebclplb0.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1oE5pTQV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fa6hlrr49870ebclplb0.gif" alt="Znote demo"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I honestly love to use it.&lt;/em&gt; 🤗&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#whats-new"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What's new?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this new version, I come with advanced features to cover intensive and professional usages. I use Znote advantageously as a replacement for various software such as SQL client, Postman or Notepad++, but also as a main tool to create and test Node scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To correctly achieve this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;✓ I entirely &lt;strong&gt;reviewed the backend code and the UI&lt;/strong&gt; to be more cleaner, usable and robust&lt;br&gt;
✓ Add a dynamic customizable &lt;strong&gt;code completion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
✓ Also, add &lt;strong&gt;Markdown shortcuts&lt;/strong&gt; and completion&lt;br&gt;
✓ A new &lt;strong&gt;Right context menu&lt;/strong&gt; with commands to transform selected text &lt;em&gt;(will be dynamic in the future)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
✓ A builder to create &lt;strong&gt;shortcut functions&lt;/strong&gt; callable in code&lt;br&gt;
✓ Add the possibility to add and use external &lt;strong&gt;NPM packages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
✓ Run code with an &lt;strong&gt;external Node installation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
✓ &lt;strong&gt;Export code&lt;/strong&gt; as scripts and Diagram as SVG&lt;br&gt;
✓ Export the entire note as &lt;strong&gt;PDF, HTML&lt;/strong&gt;...&lt;br&gt;
✓ Add various &lt;em&gt;Magic comments&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
✓ A new horizontal layout for the preview (useful for some code use cases like SQL)&lt;br&gt;
✓ More &lt;strong&gt;themes&lt;/strong&gt; to customize the app&lt;br&gt;
✓ A more &lt;strong&gt;performant search&lt;/strong&gt; box&lt;br&gt;
✓ An internal database to &lt;strong&gt;optimize memory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And so many things...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ℹ &lt;em&gt;I am also including in this list some features developed in the very latest preview versions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#and-its-really-powerful"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  And it's really powerful...
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create easily an SQL client, Postman... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5OrWigAs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/z1d3a90t569r9z7jui8w.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5OrWigAs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/z1d3a90t569r9z7jui8w.gif" alt="SQL functions"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add your NPM packages and create shortcut functions to create your perfect dedicated tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Cr6DEFmY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/je1f5dkwalvjw8t86c4m.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Cr6DEFmY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/je1f5dkwalvjw8t86c4m.png" alt="NPM"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More themes are available to enhance the experience&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hAMysySM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h34w5ox8o2g20w0nv4dw.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hAMysySM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h34w5ox8o2g20w0nv4dw.png" alt="theme"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#and-now"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  And Now?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now plan to integrate &lt;strong&gt;recipes&lt;/strong&gt; to load via an open marketplace, to safely add useful functions and commands to Znote. I'm also investigating to add automatic Jobs, tabs, a valid EV certificate... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because a software is never finished 😅, I finally decided to introduce some paid features, through a perpetual license, like themes or NPM packages &lt;em&gt;(mainly to cover advanced use cases)&lt;/em&gt; to help me to push Znote even further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will also get you a more consistent Cloud space to save and share your works between all your devices. Along the &lt;strong&gt;perpetual license&lt;/strong&gt; you will also get a year of updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More details about features on the &lt;a href="https://znote.io/checkout.html"&gt;Znote website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;❤️ I really enjoy sharing this app with you from the start, hope to see you soon in my &lt;a href="https://znote.io#newsletter"&gt;newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to share tips and tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AWS open source news and updates #80</title>
      <author>Ricardo Sueiras</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Sep 2021 07:36:57 +0000</pubDate>

  &lt;a href="#september-6th-2021-instalment-80"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  September 6th, 2021 - Instalment #80
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newsletter #80.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what delights does #80 of this newsletter offer this week? We have plenty of new open source projects, such as aws-o11y-recipes (observability recipes), dassana-io (contextual alerts), sgCheckup (security), aws-lambda-scheduler (developer tool to simplify scheduling of AWS Lambda functions), aacli (AWS cli authentication/SSO) as well as Terraform modules and AWS open source solutions covering Hugging Face, reporting on your AWS accounts and more. If you are more interesting in blog posts covering open source topics, we have posts from the AWS and community covering OpenSearch, GraphQL, Flutter, Apache Airflow, Debezium, Apache Kafka, Kubernetes, Packer, OpenTelemetry and many more. We also have a round up of posts covering last weeks GA announcement of Grafana. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Job of the week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/ur"&gt;Principal Developer Advocate - Java Specialist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new opening in my team has come up, for anyone in the Cambridge/Boston area in the US. As a Principal Developer Advocate in the AWS Developer Relations organisation, you will work to earn trust with Enterprise developers and the broader Java community through your technical leadership and expertise. This is a high-impact role that's well-suited to someone with domain-specific technical experience that enjoys sharing what they have learned in order to help users solve their technical issues and overcome any challenges they face. You will have the ability to influence and educate customers at every stage of their experience with technologies such as OpenJDK, Serverless, Containers, DevOps tools and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/ur"&gt;job description&lt;/a&gt; for more details, and please feel free to DM or email me with any questions you might have. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/up"&gt;aws-o11y-recipes&lt;/a&gt; this was the project I spent most time on last week, a new initiative/home to share recipes for observability (o11y) solutions at AWS. Currently this is covering six areas: &lt;strong&gt;destinations&lt;/strong&gt; (Prometheus, Grafana, OpenSearch, CloudWatch and Jaeger), &lt;strong&gt;agents&lt;/strong&gt; (AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry, Fluent Bit, CloudWatch agent and AWS X-Ray agent), &lt;strong&gt;languages&lt;/strong&gt; (Java and Javascript currently, Python, .NET, Go and Rust to come), &lt;strong&gt;infrastructure and databases&lt;/strong&gt; (Amazon RDS, DynamoDB and Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka), &lt;strong&gt;compute&lt;/strong&gt; (AWS Batch, Amazon ECS and EKS, Amazon ElasticBeanstalk and AWS Lambda) and &lt;strong&gt;compute engine&lt;/strong&gt; (AWS Fargate, Amazon EC2 and Amazon Lightsail). This repository will grow over time, so make sure to check it out, bookmark it and even better, why not contribute your own recipes. If you are using Python, .NET, Go or Rust, would be great to start adding those to the repo. To find out more and check out these recipes, head over to &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/uq"&gt;AWS Observability Recipes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dassana-io&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/vl"&gt;dassana-io&lt;/a&gt; this is a new open source project from Dassana that looks interesting. From the &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/vm"&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dassana is on a mission to solve the alert fatigue problem. Now, more than ever before, it is easy to "scan" your environment for security issues and deploy threat detection tools. But as soon as you deploy these tools, you will find that they start generating too many alerts. Although most of the alerts are accurate, they still lack the necessary context to be of great help. For example, if you get an alert that an s3 bucket has been found public in your environment, you might drop everything and start investigating it. But what if you find that there is a website associated with the bucket? What if the bucket has a word public or static in it? Wouldn't it be great if the alert already had this context to begin with? That's what Dassana does. Dassana adds context to security alerts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going to try and get this project up and running this week to find out more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sgCheckup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/uj"&gt;sgCheckup&lt;/a&gt; another project from the folks at Gold Fig Labs, sgCheckup is a tool to scan your AWS Security Groups for a combination of open ports and attached Network Interfaces. The goal is to find anything listening on a port that you wouldn't consider safe. In addition to generating reports for security groups, sgCheckup can generate and run nmap to get specifics. Really loving the 80's demo scene logo/graphics on the README - I would love to know how you did that. More please!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;aws-lambda-scheduler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/vh"&gt;aws-lambda-scheduler&lt;/a&gt; it would be nice if you could quickly configure any existing functions you have in AWS Lambda to work on a schedule. I know this has been something I have had to do. Whilst it is not a problem to do this, this handy open source project from &lt;br&gt;
Oğuzhan Yılmaz makes this painless. Deploy this function, and then to run your functions on a schedule, all you need to do is trigger this function with some configuration data. Example/docs will get you up and running in no time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;aacli&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/uk"&gt;aacli&lt;/a&gt; Arkady Titenko has created this nice open source CLI tool allows you to programmatically authenticate into AWS accounts through IAM roles in a multi-account AWS Organizations setup, and requires MFA enabled for your account. This project was born from an effort to figure out a simple yet reasonably secure way of programmatic authentication into AWS environments with support for MFA authentication. Read more about this project in the notes, plenty of examples of how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;aws-perspective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/ul"&gt;aws-perspective&lt;/a&gt; I have shared details about this project before, but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/toksvaeth/status/1431232907834765314"&gt;this tweet&lt;/a&gt; make me think that I should share it again incase anyone missed it the first time. AWS Perspective is a tool that quickly visualizes AWS Cloud workloads as architecture diagrams. You can use the solution to build, customize, and share detailed workload visualizations based on live data from AWS. The latest update to this project focuses heavily on cost related features that allow you to better understand your cloud billing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AWSTagsAsADatabase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/um"&gt;AWSTagsAsADatabase&lt;/a&gt; Whilst I absolutely do not recommend anyone does this, this project from Oren Leung did make me smile this week. Following on from an ongoing joke of Amazon Route53 being a "database", now comes using AWS tags as a "database". Growing up in tech in the 80s and the demo scene, this kind of reminds me of the kinds of things that folks tried to do to show what was possible. Nice effort Oren.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;web-client-for-aws-transfer-family&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grafana&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Announced during re:Invent 2020 in preview, last week saw the general availability announcement for Amazon Managed Grafana, a fully managed service developed in collaboration with Grafana Labs that makes it easy to use the open-source and the enterprise versions of Grafana to visualize and analyze your data from multiple sources. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had several posts covering this, with my colleague Danilo Poccia's sharing the news in &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/v6"&gt;Amazon Managed Grafana Is Now Generally Available with Many New Features&lt;/a&gt;. The GA announcement saw plenty of additional new features, and in the post, &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/v7"&gt;Amazon Managed Grafana is now Generally Available&lt;/a&gt;, Imaya Kumar Jagannathan and Michael Hausenblas dive a little deeper into the launch, including the new features that have been added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunil Ramachandra and Roy Rodan walk you through the steps required to integrate your identity provider with Amazon Managed Grafana, in the post &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/v8"&gt;Amazon Managed Grafana supports direct SAML integration with identity providers&lt;/a&gt;. They show you how you can assign users and appropriate roles through your identity provider so that your users can seamlessly authenticate into the Amazon Managed Grafana environment to visualise and monitor your workloads and log.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we had Julia Hu, Matthieu Fuzellier, Srikanth Kodali, and Yuxin Yang collaborate on this post, &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/v9"&gt;How to use InfluxDB and Grafana to visualize ML output with AWS IoT Greengrass&lt;/a&gt; where they show how to build an end-to-end workflow using open source tools with AWS IoT Greengrass version 2 to visualise ML inference results in near real-time on an edge device.

I was certainly curious, and in this post, &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/vf"&gt;Using the Flutter BLoC Pattern with AWS Amplify Datastore&lt;/a&gt; my good friend Derek Bingham walks you through an example of the BLoC pattern, how you can use it to improve your use of AWS Amplify Datastore API calls, to be a lot cleaner and so easier to maintain. [hands on]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GraphQL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite posts in recent weeks, Ali Spittel has put together &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/uz"&gt;A Complete Beginner's Guide to GraphQL&lt;/a&gt; which will get you up and running quickly on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you know more about GraphQL, Eric Robertson has put together this blog post, &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/uy"&gt;Implementing caching for pipeline resolvers in AWS AppSync GraphQL APIs&lt;/a&gt; that shows how to use caching for pipeline resolvers to unlock lower latency with less requests to backend data sources, and can help reduce costs when using pipeline resolvers in AppSync to orchestrate and connect data from multiple data sources with a single GraphQL API call. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ankit Anand has put together this post, &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/vg"&gt;Everything you need to know about OpenTelemetry Collector&lt;/a&gt; that provides a clean and simple guide to understanding more about what OpenTelemetry is, the architecture, why you should care and then how to get started. Worth 5 minutes of your time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this weeks winner of longest blog title competition, Alolita Sharma and Nizar Tyrewall share the release highlights from version 0.12 of AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry in the post, &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/v4"&gt;AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry 0.12 adds metrics support for AWS Lambda, Amazon ECS on EC2 metrics, and Amazon EKS metrics in Amazon Managed Prometheus (Preview)&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) Infrastructure metrics and trace collection, AWS Lambda layers supporting metrics collection for Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP) and Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) running on Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (Amazon EC2) container metrics are the three covered, so click on the link to find out more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenSearch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many times have you wondered how a piece of technology or software you use works, from end to end? In this post, &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/us"&gt;A query, or There and Back Again&lt;/a&gt; Andrew Hopp and Nicholas Knize tell the story of how a query works in OpenSearch by following a query through OpenSearch&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AWS SDKs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a couple of alpha release announcements this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start off with this post from Aaron Todd, Ian Botsford, and Ken Gilmer, in &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/v0"&gt;Announcing new AWS SDK for Kotlin alpha release&lt;/a&gt; they cover how the AWS SDK for Kotlin makes it easy to call AWS services using idiomatic Kotlin APIs. You can use the native Kotlin language constructs you are used to, have mobile support without compromises, and target multiple platforms and execution environments in a single language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following that we had Nicki Stone and John Woo with &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/v1"&gt;Announcing new AWS SDK for Swift alpha release&lt;/a&gt;. This helps customers developing in Swift that have asked for a native Swift SDK so they can use the language constructs they are used to, and provides an SDK that behaves similarly to SDKs they have used in other language environments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With post of these announcements, the SDK's are still in the early stages of development. This is a great time to influence the roadmap by sharing your thoughts on the SDK design, as well as features and services that are the most important to you. Make sure you use the links in the post to provide your ideas or feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MQTT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recently announced the general availability of MQTT retained messages for AWS IoT Core. This feature allows you to store a single message per a given MQTT topic for delivery to any current and future topic subscribers. In this post, &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/uv"&gt;Getting started with MQTT retained messages for AWS IoT Core&lt;/a&gt; Roy Kincaid provides an overview of this feature, share some use cases to keep in mind when designing your next IoT project, and provide a guide on how to get started. [hands on]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tTpqj8Ki--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f6e1126cedebf23e1463aee73f9df08783640400/2021/09/01/getting-started-with-retained-messages-01.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tTpqj8Ki--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f6e1126cedebf23e1463aee73f9df08783640400/2021/09/01/getting-started-with-retained-messages-01.png" alt="arch"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ROS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst this post, &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/vd"&gt;Introduction to ROS: The Robot Operating System&lt;/a&gt; is not AWS specific, AWS RoboMaker and Amazon have been working with this open source project/foundation for some time, and this tutorial/course is a great primer/introduction if you are interested in open source robotics. You will need to register (I did mine via LinkedIn) and the course covers the basics you need to get started. The course also links to various pieces of hardware that you will need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#quick-updates"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Quick updates
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MariaDB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for MariaDB now supports MariaDB minor versions 10.5.12, 10.4.21, 10.3.31, and 10.2.40. We recommend that you upgrade to the latest minor versions to fix known security vulnerabilities in prior versions of MariaDB, and to benefit from the numerous bug fixes, performance improvements, and new functionality added by the MariaDB community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition now supports PostgreSQL major version 13. PostgreSQL 13 includes improved functionality and performance from enhancements such as de-duplication of B-tree index entries, improved performance for queries that use partitioned tables, incremental sorting to accelerate data sorts, parallel processing of indexes with the VACUUM command, more ways to monitor activity within a PostgreSQL database, new security capabilities, and more. This release also adds support for bool_plperl, which simplifies writing Perl procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With PostgreSQL 13 on Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition you can create time series data tables with improved data ingestion rates of several hundred thousands of metrics per second for use cases such as storing DevOps metrics or tracking business metrics (e.g., daily sales).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AWS Copilot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Version 1.10 of AWS Copilot was released with support for publish/subscribe architectures that customers can use to decouple microservices and consume events asynchronously. Customers can now use AWS Copilot to build event-driven architectures or to decouple services in order to increase performance, reliability, and scalability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All existing AWS Copilot services and jobs can use the new publish field to broadcast events to Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topics. These events can then be received via Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queues with the new "Worker Service" pattern in AWS Copilot for Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) services running on AWS Fargate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS Copilot v1.10 also adds a new field taskdef_overrides in the manifest file to allow customers to add all fields supported by Amazon ECS task definitions that are not surfaced in the manifest. This enables customers to use configurations available for Amazon ECS (such as the ulimit parameter which allows customers to change default resource limit values) for their AWS Copilot jobs and services which are not supported in AWS Copilot directly. Additionally, the alias field for request and load balanced services has been augmented to accept a list of friendly domain names instead of a single entry.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Display the Progress of Promises in JavaScript</title>
      <author>Jr. Dev 👨🏾‍💻</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Sep 2021 07:33:10 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/jrdev_/how-to-display-the-progress-of-promises-in-javascript-lh0</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/jrdev_/how-to-display-the-progress-of-promises-in-javascript-lh0</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#contents"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Contents
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#overview"&gt;Overview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#implementation"&gt;Implementation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#overview"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Overview
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Displaying the progress of multiple tasks as they are completed can be helpful to the user as it indicates how long they may need to wait for the remaining tasks to finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can accomplish this by incrementing a counter after each promise has resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The video version of this tutorial can be found here...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I2UPGd0qsfY"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our desired output will look something like this, as the tasks are in progress.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Loading 7 out of 100 tasks
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;






&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#implementation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Implementation
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let's start with the markup!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All you need is a script tag to point to a JavaScript file (which will be implemented below), and one div element, whose text will be manipulated to update the progress counter of tasks completed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"progress"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;    
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"app.js"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;






&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next up, the JavaScript!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will begin by creating a function which resolves a promise after a random time has passed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do this as it closely resembles how it will work in a real-world application, e.g. HTTP requests resolving at different times.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;task&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;






&lt;p&gt;Secondly, we will create an array of 100 promises and update the progress text to inform the user when &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; of the tasks have finished.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;loadingBar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;loadingBar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promises&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;task&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;loadingBar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;textContent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Loading...`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;promises&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;loadingBar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;textContent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Loading Finished`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now imagine if this takes 30 seconds to complete. All the user will see on screen is the text 'Loading...' whilst it is in progress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is not a very useful message!&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Let's improve this now by updating the progress text after each task has resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The code snippet below is the full implementation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;loadingBar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;loadingBar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;task&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;loadingBarStatus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;loadingBar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;textContent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Loading &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promises&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;task&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;loadingBarStatus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)));&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;promises&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;loadingBar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;textContent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Loading Finished`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, you can see that as each promise is resolved, the counter is incremented and displayed to the user.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, all you need to do is update the progress as each promise is resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you found this short tutorial helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AWS SQS Workbench - A Simple &amp; Non-Technical Way To Access AWS SQS</title>
      <author>Harinder Seera 🇭🇲</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Sep 2021 07:33:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/aws-builders/aws-sqs-workbench-a-simple-non-technical-way-to-access-aws-sqs-10ec</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/aws-builders/aws-sqs-workbench-a-simple-non-technical-way-to-access-aws-sqs-10ec</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;AWS offers several methods for accessing its services. These services can be accessed via CLI, SDK, and console. If you are a technical (i.e developer), CLI and SDK are most likely your most frequently used approaches. When it comes to a newcomer, or someone who is not overly technical, using a console is preferable. However, this has its own disadvantages. To do any work, you must log in on a regular basis. Which can be annoying if all you are trying to do is access a single service such as SQS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help with this matter, I developed a Windows-based AWS SQS workbench that allows anyone to use SQS without having to know the CLI/SDK or going to the console on a regular basis. This is a great tool for QA testers/BA/Novice who wish to test putting or viewing messages in a queue. This tool is also useful for someone who isn't extremely technical yet wants to access SQS services. Especially if you're working on a Windows computer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; It can be used by both technical and non-technical people. It was, however, created with non-technical users in mind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rest of the post will walk you through how to use AWS SQS Workbench.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#download"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Download
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AWS SQS workbench executable can be found at &lt;a href="https://github.com/hseera/aws-python-utilities/blob/main/sqs%20workbench.zip"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;. When you start the &lt;strong&gt;sqs workbench&lt;/strong&gt; exe after unzipping, you will be presented with the Config screen.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Gfp5CTma--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kv3pxtjg78ptaxxlq40c.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Gfp5CTma--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kv3pxtjg78ptaxxlq40c.png" alt="alt text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#workbench-configuration"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Workbench Configuration
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the workbench, you have two options for connecting to AWS services using credentials. The first step is to enter credentials on the configuration tab. Another option is to keep your credentials in the following location on your Windows PC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/Users/[username]/.aws&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Example:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uUrarmAy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/69jrs5337x8ym9mzrp2q.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uUrarmAy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/69jrs5337x8ym9mzrp2q.png" alt="alt text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the article, we'll enter our credentials into the text box and connect. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KbOZg8CF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/z8btkn71f0l9ksgcs91k.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KbOZg8CF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/z8btkn71f0l9ksgcs91k.png" alt="alt text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the connection has been established, select the SQS tab. This is where all of the magic takes place. The following are the various components that comprise the SQS screen. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Dl3UAVGH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fa3suo8b9reqkuz9uwm3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Dl3UAVGH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fa3suo8b9reqkuz9uwm3.png" alt="alt text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-region-name"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Region Name
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The region name displays a list of all accessible AWS regions throughout the world. Click the &lt;strong&gt;"List Regions"&lt;/strong&gt; button to see the list.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yAA06dwc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uxdluo9nacpkiwewtktv.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yAA06dwc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uxdluo9nacpkiwewtktv.png" alt="alt text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-queue-list"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Queue List
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The queue list displays all available queues in that region to which you have access. If the region does not have a queue, a message will be displayed on the console. To view the queues, select the region from the region list and then click &lt;strong&gt;"List Queues"&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fbIvBg4G--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wc7p2a8xzz4ktc6uzsyu.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fbIvBg4G--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wc7p2a8xzz4ktc6uzsyu.png" alt="alt text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-messages-in-the-queue"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Messages In The Queue
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on the queue name in the list to see how many messages are in the queue, not visible, or delayed. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RAgZAG1_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0l591swe28xoov2fq47m.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RAgZAG1_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0l591swe28xoov2fq47m.png" alt="alt text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-send-message"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Send Message
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can send or view SQS messages in the current version of the workbench. Once you have selected the queue, you have two options for sending a message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can type the payload into the provided textbox section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open a file and load the payload. Use the &lt;strong&gt;Browse&lt;/strong&gt; button to locate the file containing the payload and the &lt;strong&gt;Load&lt;/strong&gt; button to display it on the screen.
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Y4m6FZbz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/l0kk6dg6460oxydw17nt.png" alt="alt text"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-send-once-or-multiple-sends"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Send Once OR Multiple Sends
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, you have two options for how many messages to send to the queue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the &lt;strong&gt;"Send Once"&lt;/strong&gt; option if you only want to send one message to the queue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to send numerous messages to the Queue, select &lt;strong&gt;"Send Multi Msgs"&lt;/strong&gt;. Enter the number of messages to send in the &lt;strong&gt;"# of Msg To Send"&lt;/strong&gt; field and the delay between each message in the &lt;strong&gt;"Delay Btw Msgs (sec)"&lt;/strong&gt; field for this option. 
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--O2PuK-Pf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/eje89861fiio0dg0oi8j.png" alt="alt text"&gt;
When sending or receiving messages, the console screen displays the time it took. This is useful if you want to examine the performance of putting and viewing messages. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-receiveview-message"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. Receive/View Message
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To view a message in the queue, choose the queue name and click the &lt;strong&gt;"Receive Msg"&lt;/strong&gt; button. It will display the message's payload. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ePtMUBjX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0kk1xztyssz063sn3qam.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ePtMUBjX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0kk1xztyssz063sn3qam.png" alt="alt text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#7-console"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  7. Console
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The console screen contains all errors, responses, and logs. The Workbench's &lt;strong&gt;"Save Output"&lt;/strong&gt; option allows you to save console data for further analysis. To clear the console message, use &lt;strong&gt;"Clear Output"&lt;/strong&gt;. In the current version, the output is saved in the same folder as the executable. "output.txt" is the name of the output file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9u5o7MV---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f07kyynzzyx629mxbrhx.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9u5o7MV---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f07kyynzzyx629mxbrhx.png" alt="alt text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's all there is to it when it comes to using the workbench. Hopefully, SQS workbench will come in handy to you in the aforementioned case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep an eye out for updates as I add new features and improvements. If you find a bug in the workbench, please post a &lt;a href="https://github.com/hseera/aws-python-utilities/issues"&gt;bug report&lt;/a&gt; so I can fix and further improve it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want to help with the code, please contact me. Also, if you find it useful, &lt;strong&gt;please leave a comment or a star on the github repo&lt;/strong&gt;. Alternatively, &lt;strong&gt;share it on your social channels&lt;/strong&gt; so that anyone who may require it is aware of the existence of sqs workbench.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What is LocalStorage</title>
      <author>Abdullah Furkan Özbek</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Sep 2021 07:18:35 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/afozbek/what-is-localstorage-348j</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/afozbek/what-is-localstorage-348j</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-definition"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Definition
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The localStorage read-only property of the window interface allows you to access a Storage object for the Document's origin; the stored data is saved across browser sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;localStorage is similar to sessionStorage, except that while localStorage data has &lt;strong&gt;no expiration time&lt;/strong&gt;, sessionStorage data gets cleared when the &lt;strong&gt;page session ends&lt;/strong&gt; — that is, when the page is closed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;localStorage data for a document loaded in a "private browsing" or "incognito" &lt;strong&gt;session is cleared&lt;/strong&gt; when the &lt;strong&gt;last "private" tab is closed&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-data-format"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Data Format
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The keys and the values stored with localStorage are always in the &lt;strong&gt;UTF-16 DOMString&lt;/strong&gt; format, which uses two bytes per character. As with objects, integer keys are automatically converted to strings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-example"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Example
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Setting and item: key: value&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;localStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;myCat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Tom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Reading an item&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;localStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;myCat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Remove an item&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;localStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;removeItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;myCat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Clear all items&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;localStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;clear&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/moghaazi/embed/BajWgav?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-advaced-examples"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Advaced Examples
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For setting objects or dates we need to convert to strings because localStorage only store string format&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;userList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;David&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Kevin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;date&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Setting&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;localStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;userList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;userList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;localStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Reading&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;userList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;localStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;userList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;date&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;localStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>10 Top UI/UX Design Trends For 2021</title>
      <author>Imia Hazel</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Sep 2021 07:13:20 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/imiahazel/10-top-ui-ux-design-trends-for-2021-dl9</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/imiahazel/10-top-ui-ux-design-trends-for-2021-dl9</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Each year, new lists of UI design trends are published, as is the case with trends. However, there is a reason behind this. When a large number of players adopt a particular trend, it ultimately becomes unsuccessful due to oversaturation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the way forward for designers is to check them out periodically to provide something fresh to their clients, while company owners may use them as a source of inspiration for their brand's development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users browse thousands of websites every day, and businesses must demonstrate more innovation to capture their attention. Entrepreneurs place a premium on the aesthetics and usefulness of their online solutions to entice customers to remain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, they keep a close eye on the &lt;a href="https://devbeep.com/css-custom-properties-variables-examples/"&gt;advanced CSS techniques&lt;/a&gt; and user interface trends to stay current.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let's take a closer look at the top UI design ideas for 2021 and discover how prominent businesses effectively integrate them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-glassmorphism"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Glassmorphism
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MWYJrM5U--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4mqx8x5dj8anr5f0ch81.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MWYJrM5U--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4mqx8x5dj8anr5f0ch81.png" alt="Glassmorphism UI, A New Variant of Neumorphism"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo by &lt;a href="https://dribbble.com/heimaui"&gt;HeiMaUX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.core77.com/posts/100422/Apples-UI-Design-Aesthetic-Moving-Towards-Neumorphism"&gt;Neomorphism&lt;/a&gt; was frequently employed in web design techniques last year. It is a synthesis of two widely used methods to user interface design. They are referred to as &lt;a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/skeuomorphism-is-dead-long-live-skeuomorphism"&gt;skeuomorphism and flat design&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. These UI trends are opposed and frequently regarded as opposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, people frequently interact with items via glass. Consider a consumer perusing a jewelers' window for a new watch. Glassmorphism simulates the appearance of being 'through the glass' by utilizing background blur. &lt;a href="https://devbeep.com/glassmorphism-effects/"&gt;Glassmorphism&lt;/a&gt; creates the illusion of a sequence of floating glass panels in a vertical area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2021, designers discovered a new interest known as &lt;a href="https://abduzeedo.com/node/86367"&gt;glassmorphism&lt;/a&gt;. This style originated with the blur effect, often known as a blurred background. When individuals view such an element, it appears as though they are gazing through a glass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerous well-known systems use this UI design. Designers, on the other hand, must keep accessibility in mind. Transparency complicates the interaction of visually challenged users with your product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're employing glassmorphism, ensure that items have sufficient contrast and space to correctly represent the hierarchy of information to make it apparent how to do actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-minimalism"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Minimalism
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EkS_fdSO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xj9hvof49f77mmdjszq9.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EkS_fdSO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xj9hvof49f77mmdjszq9.jpeg" alt="Minimalism UI/UX Design"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo by &lt;a href="https://dribbble.com/Tsiguleva"&gt;Tanya Tsiguleva&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minimalism appears to be the style these days, whether interior design or UI/UX design. Daily, we come across numerous images. Occasionally, the plan appears dense and congested. This distracted and overloaded the user, resulting in the emergence of the &lt;a href="https://pactmedia.org/"&gt;minimalistic UI/UX Design&lt;/a&gt; movement. The components in this design are kept to a minimum to avoid overwhelming the user, like &lt;a href="https://htmlcssfreebies.com/box-shadow-generator/"&gt;applying soft box shadows&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, this type of design helps keep the user-focused and away from distractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One graphic design aesthetic that will always look beautiful owing to its inherent simplicity and focus on usefulness is minimalism. Because minimalism is always clean and functional, it will be a major design trend in UI/UX in 2021 to employ this form of design to produce simple and aesthetically attractive UI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://uxdesign.cc/a-guide-to-minimalist-design-36da72d52431"&gt;Minimalist UI design&lt;/a&gt; contributes to creating a clean layout by directing the viewer's attention on goods or critical material, providing the user with the information he seeks without using extra elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-id-authentication"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. ID Authentication
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZD4qyHxe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vlkel5q9vts0hbzdniba.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZD4qyHxe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vlkel5q9vts0hbzdniba.gif" alt="Facial Unlocks"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo by &lt;a href="https://dribbble.com/eddieluong"&gt;Eddie Luong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passwords are frequently forgotten daily. The actual culprits are password systems that demand special characters, numeric characters, including capital and lowercase letters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding UI/UX design trends, while fingerprint sensors or facial unlocks are not new technologies, they are sure to receive a makeover in 2021 and beyond. The software platform is the most hacker-friendly. Fingerprint logins are an integral element of the user interface design of mobile applications. Thefts of data are on the rise, so security is a top priority nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-augmented-reality"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Augmented Reality
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AmNrWnzE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/413k7c9d7mcqq4lr61xh.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AmNrWnzE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/413k7c9d7mcqq4lr61xh.jpg" alt="Augmented Reality Interface"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo by &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/@thepaintedsquare"&gt;Jessica Lewis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web design trends in 2021 will emphasize thinking beyond the box or keeping to the grid more precisely. Forget about the screen-based UI. Rather than that, it would help if you stressed interactions that feel authentic to the actual world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google and Apple have already released their augmented reality development platforms, &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/ar"&gt;ARCore&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/"&gt;ARKit&lt;/a&gt;, enabling the seamless integration of the digital and physical worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AR user interfaces can take a variety of forms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Object-related, which employs real-world items with tethered interaction; Fixed to screen space, which requires the user to position the camera in a certain way; and Real-world-related, which uses the surrounding physical environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from their headgear, Apple spends heavily on augmented reality, and there is much enthusiasm about the &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/apple-glasses/"&gt;Apple Glasses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, if you haven't already, you should begin increasing your understanding of augmented reality user interface kits. Additionally, you may wish to consider the context &amp;amp; function of augmented reality experiences carefully. As designers, we must contemplate the possibility that we may need to prepare and begin learning new technologies. In the following years, &lt;a href="https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/principles/emerging-technology/ux-design-principles-for-augmented-reality/"&gt;building augmented reality interfaces&lt;/a&gt; with 3D components may become a precious talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-microcopy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Microcopy
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--q2lqlaQO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0kq9v7p2i9f6c8c76z21.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--q2lqlaQO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0kq9v7p2i9f6c8c76z21.png" alt="Microcopy Statement"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo by &lt;a href="https://dribbble.com/max_albi"&gt;Massimiliano Albizzati&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term "microcopy" refers to the little sentences and paragraphs that appear on the internet, on the website, in almost any app, or on a product. It may be the tiny error message or the pop-up menu. Captions, buttons, loading, and error pages may all be included. Even that one notice is informing you that the website makes use of cookies.&lt;br&gt;
That is the official definition of a user experience microcopy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, what distinguishes (excellent) microscopy is its ability to inspire people, earn their confidence, and empower them. A successful microcopy makes a statement and has a considerable effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without &lt;a href="https://uxplanet.org/microcopy-tiny-words-with-a-huge-ux-impact-90140acc6e42"&gt;microcopy&lt;/a&gt;, users would have become disoriented while interacting with any computer interface. Often referred to as "little words with a lot of power," it significantly impacts both the user experience &amp;amp; conversion rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-microinteractions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. Micro-Interactions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QL7Ys7uN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0m2s0v9xj1cd3jju05w5.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QL7Ys7uN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0m2s0v9xj1cd3jju05w5.gif" alt="Micro-Interactions Experience"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo by &lt;a href="https://dribbble.com/ai"&gt;Aaron Iker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When design addresses universal issues, micro-interactions are the pleasurable moments your consumers experience while interacting with your product. These small tempting moments bring enormous value in terms of providing a compassionate experience to end customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, they are not only aesthetic components; they perform optimally when combined with user action triggers. &lt;a href="https://uxdesign.cc/microinteractions-101-essential-tips-for-powerful-microinteractions-f1f52089a801"&gt;Micro-interactions&lt;/a&gt; are critical not for their usefulness or return on investment but because they improve the stickiness of the goods/service and contribute to successful word-of-mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#7-voice-user-interface-vui"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  7. Voice User Interface – VUI
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sk0cEn0d--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mguv69qzzsetdzsk61c4.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sk0cEn0d--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mguv69qzzsetdzsk61c4.jpg" alt="Voice User Interface"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo by &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/@maltehelmhold"&gt;Malte Helmhold&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of its broad acceptance in UX/UI design, interaction using voice user interfaces has resurfaced as a UX trend. It has long been established that design will not have to be visually appealing to function well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A voice interface is a private one. It is more about context or data synthesis than it is about designs itself. Nonetheless, designers are attempting to stay up with the current user experience trends and therefore are increasingly providing consumers with a &lt;a href="https://uxmag.com/articles/is-voice-ui-the-future-of-user-experience-design"&gt;voice interface&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, there are hundreds of applications available today that allow you to translate any word or sentence into another language. It operates as follows. By pressing a button, the gadget begins recording and interpreting your speech. This enables you to converse effortlessly with those who do not speak your language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#8-animations"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  8. Animations
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CgGqX6wv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1wxibvq3ckva2oonrba7.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CgGqX6wv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1wxibvq3ckva2oonrba7.gif" alt="Animations Design"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If distinctive graphics can capture a user's attention, animations have the power to blow them away. Animations, more than static pictures, boost user engagement and bring designs to life. There are several &lt;a href="https://designorbital.com/development/javascript-animation-libraries/"&gt;JavaScript animation libraries&lt;/a&gt; that can be used to add some cool animations to your design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustrations and animations both contribute to storytelling by aiding in the visualization of what a business or product has to offer at a glance. While drawings take less work, &lt;a href="https://tympanus.net/codrops/2020/11/09/how-to-bring-your-website-to-life-with-ui-animation/"&gt;dynamic animations&lt;/a&gt; retain all of the benefits of pictures while being more successful at directing and maintaining user attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#9-vivid-colors"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  9. Vivid Colors
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4B62i2zc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tih185520qy1y29qria9.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4B62i2zc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tih185520qy1y29qria9.jpeg" alt="Vivid Color Schemes"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo by &lt;a href="https://dribbble.com/Tsiguleva"&gt;Tanya Tsiguleva&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in my post regarding &lt;a href="https://dev.to/imiahazel/8-fundamental-principles-of-effective-web-design-196l"&gt;8 Fundamental Principles of Effective Web Design&lt;/a&gt;, this year is a big year for vibrant and colorful color schemes in graphic design and user interface design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graphic designers will leverage color psychology to convey an energetic and magical feeling to the viewer through the use of color as a critical element of the design, and you can find &lt;a href="https://templatepocket.com/places-to-sell-designs-online/"&gt;places to sell your designs online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This UI design trend would be applied in various ways and combined with a variety of graphic design components. Still, we will see it most effectively in using a creative color gradient in websites or, in some cases, blur and grain to create a new and fresh appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#10-large-typography"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  10. Large Typography
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Y1T6EWCa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9cxyr8u6d283dlga3d8y.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Y1T6EWCa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9cxyr8u6d283dlga3d8y.jpg" alt="Large and Bold Typefaces"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typography is critical in product design. In other instances, the items are based on typography. The proper selection of typefaces and font size may frequently produce &lt;a href="https://isabelmoranta.com/"&gt;astonishing outcomes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach has also been gaining traction in UI/UX trends. Graphic designers employ big fonts to capture and maintain the user's attention. Nowadays, users scan the material. They do not read all you write. Thus, UI  new designs embrace big fonts to aid the user in rapidly locating the information they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last year, we've already seen some graphic designers begin to use large and bold typefaces in UI and graphic design. With new creative typography designers conducting experiments with fonts, we expect to see a significant trend toward using large typography on UI Design in 2021. In some cases, it will be the primary element of the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many graphic designers will use chaotic typography as the primary component of their UI design projects this year. Additionally, this UI/UX Design Trend will use a brutalist design approach to generate a sense of deconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;

  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizations who follow the current user interface trends gain the ability to make their websites &amp;amp; products more enjoyable and simplified for their consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This improves the consumer experience and conversion rates. Notably, there is a delicate balance between being fashionable and providing an exciting client experience. This is where thorough study and testing separate the winners from the losers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you find this post helpful and that it provides you with a wealth of UI/UX design ideas for your next project. Feel free to experiment and play with these design trends and create unique user experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My GameDev Journey</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Esteemed friends, welcome to my dev blog. A direct English translation for my pseudo name would be "Tinear", it hints towards an old Afrikaans proverb: &lt;em&gt;'n Blikoor wees — So genoem omdat Vrystaters dan kwansuis dom sou wees omdat hulle nie met blikore kan hoor nie.&lt;/em&gt; In other words, just hinting towards the province of origin. 😜&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been learning to program for a few years now, but I have never really developed anything. Studying several programming languages in courses over the years and following along with tutorials, I still find myself in &lt;em&gt;Tutorial Purgatory&lt;/em&gt;. But although I still feel like a beginner, I like to think that I am a game developer by heart. 😏&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general consensus seems to be that there are numerous convincing reasons to blog about your journey, for new developers and professionals alike. I look forward to assisting other developers in good faith and hopefully escape Tutorial Purgatory myself in the process. Admittedly, it would be equally great to learn from other community members as well. 😎&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has launched a new feature for their teams application. Together mode is one of the feature of new meeting experience in Teams app. The together mode uses AI segmentation technology to digitally place participants in a shared background. This makes you feel like you’re sitting in the same room with everyone else in the meeting or class as shown in image above. Below is the difference between the normal meeting experience and together mode meeting experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who Can Use Together Mode in Teams?&lt;br&gt;
The Together Mode feature is available to all users. As of now, it is available for the desktop version only but will be extended to the Android/iOS Teams application soon mentioned by Microsoft Teams. As seen in the picture above, the Together Mode feature will be launched with an auditorium view. This view provides a semblance to people gathered in an auditorium, while you watch the audience as a speaker. More views are expected to be launched as the feature evolves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you get team mode together?&lt;br&gt;
Open Microsoft Teams, Click on profile icon &amp;gt; About &amp;gt; Version – Now you can see the current version of MS-Teams make sure you are updated to latest version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Click on profile icon &amp;gt; Settings &amp;gt; Put a check mark in “Turn on New Meeting Experience” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then In Teams Go-to your calendar, Click on Meet Now &amp;gt; if the new meeting experience is enabled, user find the meeting controls at top of the window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft ensures that the Teams app will now segment the faces using Artificial Intelligense (AI) and bring everyone together. This feature requires at least need 4 participants from same tenant to enable Together Mode in Microsoft Teams. Together mode stays greyed out until the 4th participant joins the call. Microsoft states that the gallery view can fit up to 49 users max at present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition - Dynamic View, Large gallery view, Live reactions, video filters are also features of new meeting experience &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advantages of Together Mode&lt;br&gt;
The primary benefit of Together Mode in Microsoft Teams is being able to see all the members of the meeting together as if they are one room or class and sitting together. It can discard the old classic video call feature where you can see one people at a time with a boxed view which nullifies to see just a restricted number of people at a time is eased. When you make a normal Teams video conference, the person who is talking frequently appears on the meeting screen with the boxed view. The rest of the persons in the meeting are in the background and are virtually ignored until they start talking in the meeting. This new feature ‘Together Mode’ acknowledges this issue. You can easily view all the people present on the call as well as read their body language and reactions during the meeting, just like we do can in physically with ease of our homes. Also this advantage is otherwise very difficult in their home environments or different backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
