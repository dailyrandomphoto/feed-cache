      <title>Evolution of API and Microservice ecosystem: part 1</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/hypertrace/evolution-of-api-and-microservice-ecosystem-part-1-399a</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this first installment in a series on the evolution of API and microservices ecosystem, we will learn about how microservices and APIs became industry standards and what are different benefits microservices offer. We will explore different challenges with this ecosystem and how to solve them in the second part of this series. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the tech giants including companies like Amazon, Netflix, started to build their systems using a monolithic architecture because back in the time it was much faster to set up a monolith and get the business moving. But over time as the product matures or fat growth happens, with growing systems the code gets more and more complicated. They all faced this problem and looked at microservices as a solution. One of the biggest benefits of microservices is that each microservice can be developed, scaled, and deployed independently. You can replace or upgrade any part of the system without affecting the whole system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, &lt;em&gt;what is microservice architecture?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html"&gt;As called out by James Lewis and Martin Fowler&lt;/a&gt;, The term "Microservice Architecture" has sprung up over the last few years to describe a particular way of designing software applications as suites of independently deployable services. While there is no precise definition of this architectural style, there are certain common characteristics around organization around business capability, automated deployment, intelligence in the endpoints, and decentralized control of languages and data. &lt;br&gt;
I hope it’s not that hard to guess but these microservices talk to each other via APIs and two of the most commonly used protocols are HTTP request-response with resource APIs and lightweight messaging. Although as I mentioned above, companies like Netflix and Amazon have been using microservices for quite a long time, many small organizations have also started adopting API first or microservice driven architectures recently, because &lt;a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/web-apis-business-perspective/"&gt;APIs have become the heart of the global tech industry in the past decade.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#rise-of-microservices"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Rise of Microservices
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive more into the origins of APIs and Microservices as they share a common origin story. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rise of service-oriented architectures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rise of cloud computing and managed services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rise of decentralization movement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rise of Agile movement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#rise-of-serviceoriented-architectures"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Rise of service-oriented architectures
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we all know, building distributed systems is hard and managing them is even harder. The rise of the web back in the days opened the doors to innovate the way we build distributed systems and that’s where Service based architecture came into the picture. SOA was defined as a style of multi-tier computing that helps organizations share logic and data among multiple applications and usage modes. [as defined by &lt;a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/302868"&gt;Gartner&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though a failed movement back in the time, SOA surely helped a lot in initiating microservice movements, and even organizations like Netflix and Amazon were calling their architectures SOAs before the microservice movement. Due to the centralized nature of ESB topology and some other reasons, SOAs increased complexity and introduced bottlenecks, and the costs of implementing an SOA infrastructure (based on the ESB, registry, and service platform template) were excessive.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to these problems, people started looking for better alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#rise-of-cloud-computing-and-managed-services"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Rise of cloud computing and managed services
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise of RESTful Web APIs arose as a lighter-weight alternative to SOAP services. -- a style of interconnecting applications that had evolved organically on the Web --. The distributed nature of cloud infrastructure challenged the placement of the centralized ESB topology.&lt;br&gt;
Everyone started adopting microservices due to the benefits they provided and here we are today looking at complex modern architectures. Cloud computing helped in removing barriers for deployment and provided a variety of new use-cases for APIs. It worked out as a novel platform for deploying more granular API-fronted application components. Cloud services provided another reason to move towards more service-oriented and modular deployment architectures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#rise-of-decentralization-moment"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Rise of decentralization moment
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we discussed earlier, at one point in time, service-oriented computing became an increasingly popular paradigm for modeling and building distributed systems in open and heterogeneous environments. However, proposed service-oriented architectures are typically based on centralized components, such as service registries or service brokers, that introduce reliability, management, and performance issues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this whole time, the capabilities and scale of distributed systems have increased. The trend towards decentralization in both the system itself as well as the supporting organization started to catch up and the decentralization moment started. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#rise-of-agile-moment"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Rise of Agile moment
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his blog post titled “&lt;a href="http://www.codingthearchitecture.com/2013/09/03/what_is_agile_software_architecture.html"&gt;Coding the Architecture&lt;/a&gt;”, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/simonbrown"&gt;Simon Brown&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that agile architecture does not naturally emerge from agile development practices. Rather, it must be consciously sought. Note that his description of agile software architecture is a perfect match for microservice architecture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we look at the characteristics of agile software architecture, we tend to think of something that is built using a collection of small, loosely coupled components/services that collaborate together to satisfy an end-goal. This style of architecture provides agility in a number of ways. Small, loosely coupled components/services can be built, modified, and tested in isolation, or even ripped out and replaced depending on how requirements change. This style of architecture also lends itself well to a very flexible and adaptable deployment model, since new components/services can be added and scaled if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agile software movement arose as a reaction to the same centralized approach to enterprise IT that hampered the SOA movement. Agile’s popularity and success in software development led to the CI/CD approach to software deployment, followed by the cultural philosophy of the DevOps movement. Between CI/CD, DevOps, agile development, and progressive delivery, the software delivery train also started speeding up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#benefits-of-microservices"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Benefits of Microservices
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have gone through the reasons behind the rise of Microservices, Let’s try to understand what business value microservices provide. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason that drives the move to microservices in any organization is speed and agility at scale which helps in software delivery. Reducing cross-team coordination, building diverse language applications, flexible deployments, enhanced manageability are some of the additional perks that organizations with microservice architectures enjoy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the benefits which come with Microservice architectures are mostly due to the API-first nature of microservices and here are a few of them: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Composability:&lt;/strong&gt; When services are published through an API, it is easier to use them in multiple business contexts to assist in various business processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Testability:&lt;/strong&gt; When services are accessible over a network boundary, it is easier to isolate tests and exercise individual components of the system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Scalability:&lt;/strong&gt; Each microservice can be scaled autonomously without disrupting the other microservices that comprise the application. When demand increases, you only need to upgrade or divert more resources to the microservice affected by the increasing demands. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Evolvability:&lt;/strong&gt; When services are exposed through an API, implementation details can be hidden from the consumer, making it easier to change components without impacting dependent parts of the system &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Comprehensibility:&lt;/strong&gt; When a complex system is broken down into modular APIs, it is easier to understand the overall business functionality of the system, which helps in both designing and maintaining the system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Automatability:&lt;/strong&gt; Along with the data plane API benefits above, control plane APIs allow automation in the deployment and management of microservices, thus increasing the velocity of software delivery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as we know &lt;em&gt;with great power comes great responsibility&lt;/em&gt; and the same thing applies to microservices and API ecosystems as well. These complex systems bring a lot of challenges with them and we will discuss those challenges in the next part of this blog post. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Writing my first C# MVC Unit Test</title>
      <author>Seth A Burleson</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 May 2021 14:29:12 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/sbrevolution5/writing-my-first-c-mvc-unit-test-13ah</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/sbrevolution5/writing-my-first-c-mvc-unit-test-13ah</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After much research and thought, I'm diving in today with a very basic C# unit test, just to get my feet wet with Test Driven Development.  The purpose of this test, is to see if the home index will return 2 blogs.  It should be very simple, and I honestly rarely expect this test to break, but you've got to start somewhere!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-setup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The setup.
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've Installed the xUnit extension into VS2019, and I'm adding a new xUnit Test Project to my solution.  Since this is for my blog project, I'll name it BlogTests, and put it in my project folder.  This creates a sample test with nothing in it at the moment, but we will fix that shortly.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#autogenerated-tests"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Auto-generated "Tests"
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the great things about VS2019 is that it can generate a "test" for you.  This test doesn't do anything, but it gives us a starting point.  Over in the main project's home controller, if we right click inside the index action (you can right click inside the overall class to make more than one test at once if needed) and go to "Create Unit tests" we get a lovely pop-up that gives us some options.  If its not already selected, make sure the Test Framework is xUnit.net 2.0, then select your test project, and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;New Test File&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; before you hit OK.  I'm having it assert failure for all tests right now, since there isn't anything going on just yet.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#mocking-the-database"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Mocking the database
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With EFCore, we actually don't have to make a Mock database, we will instead use the local database for testing.   It was rather difficult to get the Mock database working with EFCore, and in my research it turned out to be unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#writing-the-test-itself"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Writing the test itself
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we have our Mock Database, we are ready to write the test.  Lets use a more descriptive name than "Index Test".  There are 3 parts considered standard to a test name:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The behavior being tested&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The constraints&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The expected behavior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm going to use "Index_ReturnsAViewResult_WithAPagedListOfFiveBlogs" as the name.  Its a mouthful, but if my test fails I will immediately know what failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are now 3 parts to our test: Arrange, Act, and Assert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#arrange"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Arrange
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This step involves putting the data in the correct spot, and performing any setup.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;var optionsBuilder = new DbContextOptionsBuilder&amp;lt;ApplicationDbContext&amp;gt;();
            optionsBuilder.UseNpgsql(Connection.GetConnectionString(_configuration));
            var _dbContext = new ApplicationDbContext(optionsBuilder.Options);

            var controller = new HomeController(null,_dbContext);```


The optionsBuilder is used to configure options for the ApplicationDbContext, which then is passed to the controller.  I did not pass the controller a logger at this point, since I am not using the logger to test.  Your options builder should take the same arguments that are used in startup.cs to set up your database.  

## Act.  
This part is very simple, just get a result from the controller
`            var result = await controller.Index(1); //passing page 1`
I'm passing a variable because my site is using X.PagedList to paginate (see [this post](https://dev.to/sbrevolution5/3-steps-to-paging-in-asp-net-blog-part-3-371m))

## Assert
 And here's the meat and potatoes, We're going to check that the type is ViewResult, and the model is based on an IPagedList.  Then finally, we ensure that the model only includes 5 items for this page.


&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;var viewResult = Assert.IsType(result);&lt;br&gt;
            var model = Assert.IsAssignableFrom&amp;gt;(viewResult.Model);&lt;br&gt;
            Assert.Equal(5, actual: model.Count());&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;


To run a test, we use a series of "assert" statements.  If any of these fail, we will recieve a failure on a test.  This is where we're going to stop for now, but as a first experiment in testing, I'd call this a success.  

My main struggle at the moment is coming up with the right kind of tests.  Unlike working with a very math based console app, I don't feel like I have much to test within the controllers.  

What kinds of tests do you do with MVC apps? 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Keep your AWS Kubernetes costs in check with intelligent allocation</title>
      <author>CAST AI</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 May 2021 14:25:24 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/castai/keep-your-aws-kubernetes-costs-in-check-with-intelligent-allocation-2l8l</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/castai/keep-your-aws-kubernetes-costs-in-check-with-intelligent-allocation-2l8l</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Traditional cost allocation and Kubernetes are like oil and water. Surely, containerized environments make a lot of things easier. But not this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, there are a few things you can do to &lt;strong&gt;allocate AWS Kubernetes costs smarter&lt;/strong&gt; and keep them in check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read on to find out what they are and finally hold the reins over your cloud expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you’ll find inside:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re not the only one getting confused by Kubernetes costs, here’s why&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculating shared costs is a nightmare&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Containers are very dynamic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dealing with multiple cost centers is hard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Autoscaling leads to more confusion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allocating AWS Kubernetes costs, the smart way&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use container classes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Break costs down for labeling and tagging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish labeling and namespace standards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Split and allocate shared costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Count in cluster costs beyond the core&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to apply all of this and win the cost allocation game&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#youre-not-the-only-one-getting-confused-by-kubernetes-costs-heres-why"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  You’re not the only one getting confused by Kubernetes costs, here’s why
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mRFc50SK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5844rai8vp9m5zitdu79.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mRFc50SK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5844rai8vp9m5zitdu79.jpeg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting the hang of &lt;a href="https://cast.ai/blog/kubernetes-cost-estimation-4-problems-and-how-to-solve-them/"&gt;Kubernetes cost estimation&lt;/a&gt;, allocation, and reporting is something every team mindful of its expenses aspires to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why is it so hard? Here are 4 Kubernetes cost challenges we all know all too well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-calculating-shared-costs-is-a-nightmare"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Calculating shared costs is a nightmare
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes clusters are in essence shared services multiple teams run to hold multiple containers and apps. Once a team deploys a container, it uses some of the cluster’s resources – so, you need to pay for each and every server instance that is part of your cluster. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t sound so hard until you try making that work with, say, three teams working on ten unique applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which application or project uses the biggest chunk of your cluster resources? You can’t really tell, because all of these projects use multiple containers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing how many resources an individual container uses from a specific server is next to impossible. And that’s what makes allocating Kubernetes costs so challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-containers-are-very-dynamic"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Containers are very dynamic
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A container’s lifespan lasts only &lt;a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/container-report/"&gt;one day&lt;/a&gt;. Compare that to how long your virtual machine lasts. It’s a speck in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dynamic character of your containerized environment makes calculating costs even more complex. You need to come up with a cost management system that can handle it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-dealing-with-multiple-cost-centers-is-hard"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Dealing with multiple cost centers is hard
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s likely that not all development costs come from the DevOps budget and you have a number of cost centers running across your company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While your product team develops core applications, &lt;strong&gt;another team might launch a shadow IT project that consumes resources.&lt;/strong&gt; You need to consider this especially if your business has multiple digital services and each comes with its own teams and budgets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When multiple teams use one cluster, identifying which one is responsible for which part of the bill is a hard nut to crack. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-autoscaling-leads-to-more-confusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Autoscaling leads to more confusion
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teams often use the three built-in &lt;a href="https://cast.ai/blog/guide-to-kubernetes-autoscaling-for-cloud-cost-optimization/"&gt;Kubernetes autoscaling&lt;/a&gt; mechanisms that reduce the waste (and cost) of running clusters. But autoscaling has an impact on your cost calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;strong&gt;Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)&lt;/strong&gt; automatically adjusts requests and limits configuration to eliminate overhead. It changes the number of requests on a container, increasing and reducing its resource allocation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on scaling out to get the best combo of CPU or RAM allocated to an instance. It changes the number of containers all the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-does-it-matter-heres-an-example-scenario"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why does it matter? Here’s an example scenario:
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imagine that you have three webserver containers running during the night. Everything works well. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But there are some peak hours during the day – so HPA scales from 3 to 50 containers. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When lunchtime comes and demand is lower, it scales down. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And then it brings the scale back up for the afternoon rush, only to settle at a low level as the day ends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of containers and their sizes is very dynamic in this setup. This complicates the process of calculating and forecasting AWS Kubernetes costs even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Allocating AWS Kubernetes costs, the smart way
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JFHtz_-8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g9w2nc8pxydbjnv2af6q.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JFHtz_-8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g9w2nc8pxydbjnv2af6q.jpeg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at your &lt;a href="https://cast.ai/blog/cloud-bill-5-common-issues-and-how-to-deal-with-them/"&gt;cloud bill&lt;/a&gt;. You get charged for every instance that makes up a cluster where containers are deployed. You need to pay for that resource, even if you’re not using it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To allocate the individual costs of a container running on a given cluster, you need to discover how much of the server the container ended up consuming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then add the satellite AWS Kubernetes costs of a running cluster to that as well (from management nodes and software licensing to backups and disaster recovery). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to do it? Here are some best practices for allocating Kubernetes costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-use-container-classes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Use container classes
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can set different resource guarantees on scheduled containers in Kubernetes. They’re called Quality of Service (QoS) classes. Here’s a quick introduction: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guaranteed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These pods are top priority and guaranteed to not get killed until the moment they exceed their limits. If limits and requests (not equal to 0) are set for all the resources across your containers and are equal, the pod is classified as guaranteed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use this for critical service containers to make sure that a pod gets the vCPU and memory it needs at all times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Burstable&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your workload experiences spikes, it should have access to more resources when it needs them. This setup allows the pod to use more resources than requested at first – as long as the capacity is available on the underlying instance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of allocation works like burstable instances AWS offers (T-series) – they give you a base level of performance and allow the pod to burst when it requires more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is much more cost-effective than investing in an instance large enough to cover the spikes but way too large for regular operation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BestEffort&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These pods are the lowest priority and get killed first if your system runs out of memory. This allocation allows the pod to run while there’s excess capacity available and stops it when it’s not. It works like spot instances in AWS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a good idea to allocate a mix of pods that have different resource allocation guarantees into a server instance to increase its utilization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, you can allocate a baseline of resources to guaranteed resource pods, add some burstable pods that use up to the remainder of resources, and best-effort pods that take advantage of any spare capacity. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--40oSvMYY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/khsh54z9anhb40bf7bfk.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--40oSvMYY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/khsh54z9anhb40bf7bfk.jpeg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-break-costs-down-for-labeling-and-tagging"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Break costs down for labeling and tagging
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breaking costs into separate categories helps to make sense of them through labels and tagging. Here are a few categories that Kubernetes teams find useful:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Billing hierarchy&lt;/strong&gt; – develop and align it with your cloud costs (for example, projects, folders, or organizations),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Resources&lt;/strong&gt; – this part covers compute cores, GPU, TPU, RAM, load balancers, custom machines, network egress, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Namespaces&lt;/strong&gt; – it’s a good practice to label specific and isolated containers,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Labels&lt;/strong&gt; – come up with labels reflecting different cost centers, teams, application names, environments, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-establish-labeling-and-namespace-standards"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Establish labeling and namespace standards
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Develop and implement a labeling and namespace strategy – and stick to it when allocating cluster costs. That way, teams that use AWS can see which groups are driving costs in a given cluster. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the proportional resources consumed by every group and use your findings to allocate cluster costs to these groups. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s an example:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say that you have four namespaces in a cluster. Each of them consumes 25% of the cluster resources. One way to allocate costs would be taking 25% of the total cluster costs and allocating them to each namespace. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, this is an example scenario – don’t expect things to be so straightforward in the real world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before setting out to do that, establish how you’ll be determining cluster resource utilization – by CPU, memory, or a combination of these two? Are you going to look at requests or actual consumption? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;If you go for actual usage,&lt;/strong&gt; each team will only pay for what it uses. But who will be covering the bill for idle time? How are you going to deal with overprovisioning? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;If you allocate costs by resource requests,&lt;/strong&gt; you’ll encourage teams to provision only what they need and allocate all the costs. But this might also lead teams to underestimate their requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-split-and-allocate-shared-costs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Split and allocate shared costs
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies have unique ways to split infrastructure costs. These methods often get inherited when they start using Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a set of best practices if you’re looking for another approach:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-define-what-shared-costs-are"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  a. Define what shared costs are
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This depends on the maturity and size of your company. You share the cloud bill at the organizational level but need to allocate it either to a centralized budget or different cost centers. Still, your shared costs will be charged within one account, so understanding which AWS Kubernetes costs should be shared is challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are a few examples of commonly shared costs:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shared resources (network, storage like data lakes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Platform services (Kubernetes, logging)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enterprise-level support and discounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Licensing and third-party costs &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take support charges as an example. They’re applied at the parent account level. While some businesses cover them with a central budget of the IT or cloud team, others go a step further and allocate this cost to customers like application owners or business units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise of shared platforms where multiple teams use the same core resources complicates this – like Kubernetes systems that run on shared clusters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#b-split-your-shared-costs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  b. Split your shared costs
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tagging helps to do that accurately, and you can choose from several techniques:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proportional split – based on the relative percentage of direct costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even split – where you split the total amount evenly across all targets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed proportion split – based on a user-defined coefficient 
This is a bit abstract, so let’s show an example.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine that you have several business units that consume a different portion of cloud resources:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XGOtmx0S--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xhxoyiwtwtfzflrmpxq8.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XGOtmx0S--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xhxoyiwtwtfzflrmpxq8.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#you-get-a-15k-enterprise-support-charge-on-top-of-that-so-your-final-bill-is-115k-per-month"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  You get a $15k enterprise support charge on top of that, so your final bill is $115k per month.
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how this plays out in different splitting techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#proportional-split"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Proportional split
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this model, you split the $15k enterprise support charge among your three business units based on the percentage of their spend in direct charges. So, the sales operations team that uses 50% of your bill will also be accountable for $7.5k on top of their bill. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--V0jo2Elx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9uqxrgb7a8dloek7tnbv.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--V0jo2Elx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9uqxrgb7a8dloek7tnbv.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#even-split"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Even split
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This model is simpler, so you can often find it among smaller companies with fewer business units. In this scenario, the $15k enterprise support charge is shared evenly by all business units – so $5k each.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3vcgFx9x--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oc6fitb3eyujszv0pd5f.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3vcgFx9x--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oc6fitb3eyujszv0pd5f.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#fixed-proportion-split"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Fixed proportion split
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using this method, you set a fixed percentage for attributing shared costs based on past spend. The idea is to get a fair breakdown. So if you decide that the sales operations team’s shared cost allocation is 40%, then it will get $6k of the enterprise support fee allocated to it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ps1406bY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9wwrt2pjfjim4g9nwiv6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ps1406bY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9wwrt2pjfjim4g9nwiv6.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-count-in-cluster-costs-beyond-the-core"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Count in cluster costs beyond the core
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5v-8zJil--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/iv6h4mt1nsacmhojrfxy.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5v-8zJil--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/iv6h4mt1nsacmhojrfxy.jpeg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When allocating costs to cluster consumers, consider the satellite costs of operating this cluster like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Management and operational costs&lt;/strong&gt; – these are charged by AWS for managing the cluster for you. For example, EKS charges $0.1 per hour per Kubernetes cluster – this amounts to c. $74 per month. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learn more here: &lt;a href="https://cast.ai/blog/aws-eks-vs-ecs-vs-fargate-where-to-manage-your-kubernetes/"&gt;AWS EKS vs. ECS vs. Fargate: Where to manage your Kubernetes?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Storage&lt;/strong&gt; – add the costs of storage consumed by the host OS on the nodes, and any backup or data retrieval storage that is used in operating a production cluster can be allocated back to the workloads running on the cluster. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Licensing&lt;/strong&gt; – these costs might be included in your AWS bill, but if you use Bring Your Own License (BOYL), you need to allocate this cost from the external spend. Moreover, software packages running on the host OS might incur a license fee too. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Observability&lt;/strong&gt; – these metrics and logs are transferred from the cluster to a service your teams use to monitor and visualize them. This cost might be incurred by AWS or a third-party SaaS solution. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt; – AWS offers a wealth of security features, but they come at an extra fee that needs to be allocated.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-apply-all-of-this-and-win-the-cost-allocation-game"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to apply all of this and win the cost allocation game
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementing all of these best practices at once is bound to overwhelm you. So start small and develop a process for allocating costs. Build an understanding of how these costs should be allocated in your company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or get a solution that keeps your AWS Kubernetes costs at bay. Analyzing and allocating costs is so much easier if you have access to a detailed overview like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tTnF-fJU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lxa8iuw6lrst2ih4vj83.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tTnF-fJU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lxa8iuw6lrst2ih4vj83.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s how to get started:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://cast.ai/eks-optimizer/"&gt;Analyze your cluster for free&lt;/a&gt; to see every single detail that increases your AWS bill.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why you should have a code of conduct on GitHub </title>

      <link>https://dev.to/ashfreels/why-you-should-have-a-code-of-conduct-on-github-41ob</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/ashfreels/why-you-should-have-a-code-of-conduct-on-github-41ob</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I made the decision to add a code of conduct to my current and future repos on GitHub. Based on my personal experiences I made my choice when I asked these questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the purpose of a code of conduct?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can I prevent negative behavior in the future?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What enforcement will take place for rule violations?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of writing this article is to advocate creating a safe space and a welcoming environment in the open source community. As developers we should respect one another and this includes contributing to open source projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-few-bad-apples-make-it-bad-for-everyone"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A few bad apples make it bad for everyone
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any good open source project will have a detailed README.md and a CONTRIBUTING.md in the repo. It is important to create a positive environment for contributors. However, negative and toxic behavior can push contributors away from a project.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#git-commits-and-documentation-are-not-for-harassment"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Git commits and documentation are not for harassment
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commits and proper documentation are used to document changes in a project. The purpose is not to bully or harass individuals who made a mistake. This can deter contributors to contribute for another project. Examples of a toxic open source environment was calling out people's first name in the commits, putting down contributors, taking credit and not acknowledging  the work of others. I have been on the receiving end and the outcome was not pretty.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-code-of-conduct-is-needed"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A code of conduct is needed
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want multiple contributors to your open source project having clear guidelines for contributors is essential. Adding a code of conduct on my part was to make my projects welcome to anyone who wants to contribute. You can choose to adopt a code of conduct that reflects your community standards.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#final-thoughts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Final thoughts
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code of Conducts are meant to create an inclusive environment. Having one creates boundaries for open source projects and makes sure everyone follows the guidelines when contributing. Encouraging participation in the community and creating a harassment free environment makes contributors feel welcome. I would welcome any contributions to a project.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#resources"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Resources
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project"&gt;Adding a code of conduct in GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://opensource.guide/code-of-conduct/#:~:text=as%20a%20maintainer-,Why%20do%20I%20need%20a%20code%20of%20conduct%3F,just%20your%20participants%2C%20but%20yourself."&gt;Your Code of Conduct&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>As A Front-End Developer in 2021</title>
      <author>Danish Saleem</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 May 2021 13:56:01 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/mrdanishsaleem/as-a-front-end-developer-in-2021-54k4</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/mrdanishsaleem/as-a-front-end-developer-in-2021-54k4</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I've compiled a list of some things I think it will be useful to learn for front-end developers in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-the-basics"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. The Basics
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good place to start is going back to the basic. When was the last time you wrote simple plain HTML, CSS &amp;amp; JavaScript?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it's been a while it might be time to revisit and make sure you're up to date with the latest standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-libraries-frameworks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Libraries / Frameworks
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript frameworks / libraries, like &lt;a href="https://reactjs.org/"&gt;React&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://vuejs.org/"&gt;Vue&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://angular.io/"&gt;Angular&lt;/a&gt;, are very popular at the moment so it's a good idea to try out at least one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-static-site-generators"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Static Site Generators
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Static site generators are also quite popular and work well for smaller projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of static site generators out there but I would recommend you try out &lt;a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/"&gt;Gatsby&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/"&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.11ty.dev/"&gt;11ty&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-progressive-web-apps"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Progressive Web Apps
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PWA's have been around for a while but with more and more focus being put on website performance it's a good opportunity to learn something new &amp;amp; improve your projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-graphql"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. GraphQL
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're working with data then you should definitely give &lt;a href="https://graphql.org/"&gt;GraphQL&lt;/a&gt; a try. It also pairs very well with JavaScript frameworks and static site generators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-automated-testing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. Automated Testing
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All production code should have some automated tests, so if testing isn't your strong suite then it might be time to skill up. &lt;a href="https://jestjs.io/"&gt;Jest tests&lt;/a&gt; work well with JavaScript frameworks and if you're looking for some end-to-end tests try out &lt;a href="https://www.cypress.io/"&gt;Cypress&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://garris.github.io/BackstopJS/"&gt;Backstop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any additional suggestions leave them in the comments and share what you will be learning this year.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Adding ESLint to an Angular Micro Frontend architecture</title>
      <author>Petar Garžina</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 May 2021 13:47:21 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/pgarzina/adding-eslint-to-an-angular-micro-frontend-architecture-161g</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/pgarzina/adding-eslint-to-an-angular-micro-frontend-architecture-161g</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently we moved our platform from a mono repo to a micro frontend architecture. One of the things we wanted to add was a base linter that is shared across our apps to ensure a more standardized code as both the platform and the number of micro applications expand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I'll share the basic rundown of the things we had to do in order to get the linter up and running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-transition-from-tslint-to%C2%A0eslint"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Transition from TSLint to ESLint
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted in the ng lint &lt;a href="https://angular.io/cli/lint"&gt;Angular Docs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://palantir.github.io/tslint/"&gt;TSLint&lt;/a&gt; is being deprecated in favor of &lt;a href="https://eslint.org/"&gt;ESLint&lt;/a&gt;. The migration is rather straightforward and boils down to these two lines:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;installing the schematics&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ng add @angular-eslint/schematics&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and running the converter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ng g @angular-eslint/schematics:convert-tslint-to-eslint&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a more detailed migration guide, see this article: &lt;a href="https://dev.to/gsarciotto/migrating-and-configuring-eslint-with-angular-11-3fg1"&gt;https://dev.to/gsarciotto/migrating-and-configuring-eslint-with-angular-11-3fg1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-add-superlinter-to-github%C2%A0actions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Add Super-Linter to GitHub Actions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting up &lt;a href="https://github.com/github/super-linter"&gt;Super-Linter&lt;/a&gt; was super easy, since we already had a workflows &lt;code&gt;test-pull-req.yml&lt;/code&gt; file that tests our build on each pull request. Adding the linter was merely adding another step to the process.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;Test And Lint Pull Request&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;pull_request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;branches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pi"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;jobs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;runs-on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;ubuntu-latest&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nn"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;Lint Code Base&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;github/super-linter@v3&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;NODE_ENV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;production&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;VALIDATE_ALL_CODEBASE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;DEFAULT_BRANCH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;GITHUB_TOKEN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;LINTER_RULES_PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;TYPESCRIPT_ES_CONFIG_FILE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;.eslintrc.js&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;VALIDATE_TYPESCRIPT_ES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nn"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Super-Linter &lt;a href="https://github.com/github/super-linter"&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; are pretty self explanatory, the only additional thing we added here is the &lt;code&gt;NODE_ENV&lt;/code&gt; variable, that will be used a bit later. The &lt;code&gt;VALIDATE_ALL_CODEBASE&lt;/code&gt; variable came in nicely as the linter lints only files changed, so it makes adding new linter rules a bit more easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point you are good to go, you have migrated to the new ESLint and your files are being linted on each Pull Request. Tap yourself on the back!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-share-and-extend-the-base-lint%C2%A0rules"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Share and extend the base lint rules
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we have around 10 applications, adding or changing a rule requires us to change it in each of the 10 applications; ain't nobody got time for that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we switched to the micro frontend platform we started utilizing our own Angular library for some of the configs, components, pipes and services that we use around the platform. We also keep a part of our &lt;a href="https://tailwindcss.com/"&gt;Tailwind&lt;/a&gt;(❤) config in our libraries &lt;code&gt;assets&lt;/code&gt; folder, so that was the obvious place to put our base lint config as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing to note here is, to make your library include the &lt;code&gt;assets&lt;/code&gt; folder in the final &lt;code&gt;dist&lt;/code&gt; you have to explicitly tell it to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This happens in the libraries &lt;code&gt;ng-package.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"dest"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"../../dist/app-library"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"assets"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"./assets"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"lib"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"entryFile"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"src/public-api.ts"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now each application's &lt;code&gt;eslintrc.js&lt;/code&gt; can reference and extend the &lt;code&gt;base-eslint.js&lt;/code&gt; using the &lt;code&gt;extends&lt;/code&gt; property&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="na"&gt;root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="na"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./node_modules/@cognism/app-library/assets/configs/linter/base-eslint.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-add-application-specific%C2%A0rules"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Add application specific rules
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how our most basic &lt;code&gt;eslintrc.js&lt;/code&gt; config looks like in one of our micro applications.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="na"&gt;root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="na"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./node_modules/@cognism/app-library/assets/configs/linter/base-eslint.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="na"&gt;overrides&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="na"&gt;files&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;*.ts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="na"&gt;rules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@angular-eslint/component-selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class="na"&gt;prefix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;app-nav&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class="na"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;kebab-case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@angular-eslint/directive-selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class="na"&gt;prefix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;appNav&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class="na"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;camelCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you can see, first we extend our &lt;code&gt;base-eslint.js&lt;/code&gt; rules and then we override it with our application specific rules. In this case we just want to have application specific prefixes for both components and directives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-add-environment-dependent-rules"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Add environment dependent rules
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea here was to enable different rule behaviors depending on the environment. For example the &lt;code&gt;console.log&lt;/code&gt;. We don't want the log statement committed to the main branch, but we also don't want to give out errors to developers while writing logs in their local environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to do it was by simply using a ternary operator inside the lint file. Note that your config file must be in &lt;code&gt;.js&lt;/code&gt; format and not in the default &lt;code&gt;.json&lt;/code&gt; format to be able to do this.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;rules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@typescript-eslint/naming-convention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;enumMember&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;UPPER_CASE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@angular-eslint/no-empty-lifecycle-method&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;off&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;no-console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;NODE_ENV&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;production&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;warn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you can see, this is where the &lt;code&gt;NODE_ENV&lt;/code&gt; kicks in which we defined in our GitHub Actions &lt;code&gt;test-pull-req.yml&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did implement different environments this way, but are also aware that it might get messy with a lot of ternaries in different rules. If that comes to be the case, we ll just start using two files, eg. &lt;code&gt;eslintrc.js&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;prod-eslintrc.js&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;test-pull-req.yml&lt;/code&gt; file will always point to &lt;code&gt;prod-eslintrc.js&lt;/code&gt; while in development we'll use &lt;code&gt;eslintrc.js&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-there-you-have-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. There you have it!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We used single-spa &lt;a href="https://single-spa.js.org/"&gt;https://single-spa.js.org/&lt;/a&gt; to move our monolith to the front-end microservices world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Angular version used was v11.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Jekyll - Turn your static files into static websites</title>
      <author>Maxime Guilbert</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 May 2021 13:40:13 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/adaendra/jekyll-turn-your-static-files-into-static-websites-2fbf</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/adaendra/jekyll-turn-your-static-files-into-static-websites-2fbf</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Discovered recently, &lt;strong&gt;Jekyll&lt;/strong&gt; is a really cool tool that will easily help you create a blog or static website!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we can see in the &lt;a href="https://jekyllrb.com/showcase/"&gt;Jekyll showcase&lt;/a&gt;, we can find really cool websites like : &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://devices.netflix.com/en/"&gt;Netflix Devices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://worldstatisticsday.org/"&gt;UN World Statistics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.twitchcon.com/"&gt;TwitchCon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://lab.github.com/"&gt;GitHub on demand training&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9_jNBKlN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n6q7f7l5kox184pv1j8x.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9_jNBKlN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n6q7f7l5kox184pv1j8x.PNG" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-are-the-advantages-of-jekyll"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What are the advantages of Jekyll?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Markdown-based&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lot of free themes are available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can easily use it with Github Pages to publish your site or blog for free!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-jekyll-rather-all-the-other-tools-to-generate-a-site-from-markdown"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why Jekyll rather all the other tools to generate a site from markdown?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, the other tools which generates static websites from markdown are made for documentation purpose. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jekyll will allow you to create a blog.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you want to have a static website for your documentation, maybe Jekyll is not the best choice.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;About how to install it and how to use it, please go check the website of jekyll which contains all what you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/"&gt;Installation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/"&gt;Tutorial to use Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#links"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Links
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Website: &lt;a href="https://jekyllrb.com/"&gt;https://jekyllrb.com/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jekyll themes:

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://jekyllthemes.io/free"&gt;https://jekyllthemes.io/free&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/"&gt;http://jekyllthemes.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;p&gt;I hope it will help you!&lt;/p&gt;

  👋 About the author
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Bobby Iliev, and I have been working as a Linux DevOps Engineer since 2014. I am an avid Linux lover and supporter of the open-source movement philosophy. I am always doing that which I cannot do in order that I may learn how to do it, and I believe in sharing knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it's essential always to keep professional and surround yourself with good people, work hard, and be nice to everyone. You have to perform at a consistently higher level than others. That's the mark of a true professional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information, please visit my blog at &lt;a href="https://bobbyiliev.com"&gt;https://bobbyiliev.com&lt;/a&gt;, follow me on Twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bobbyiliev_"&gt;@bobbyiliev_&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQWmdHTeAO0UvaNqve9udRw"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Terminal Setup with Zsh + Tmux + Dracula Theme</title>
      <author>André Brandão</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 May 2021 13:13:49 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/andrenbrandao/terminal-setup-with-zsh-tmux-dracula-theme-48lm</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/andrenbrandao/terminal-setup-with-zsh-tmux-dracula-theme-48lm</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jqU-5jfN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wj14uwquctgcsvppq83j.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jqU-5jfN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wj14uwquctgcsvppq83j.gif" alt="Tmux Animation"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have just recently improved my terminal setup after learning how to use Tmux. It gave me a way to move faster between projects and even kept my session saved after machine shutdowns. My goal here is to help you configure a environment that will be both beautiful and functional. Let's get to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-we-will-set-up"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What we will set up
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guake&lt;/strong&gt;: top-down terminal that can be instantaneously opened with a keystroke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zsh&lt;/strong&gt;: an extended Bourne Shell (sh) with many improvements, powerful command line editing options, and support for plugins and themes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oh-My-Zsh&lt;/strong&gt;: an open source, community-driven framework for managing your Zsh configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Powerlevel10k&lt;/strong&gt;: a theme for Zsh with interface helpers, such as git current branch and execution time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tmux&lt;/strong&gt;: an open-source terminal multiplexer for Unix-like operating systems. It allows multiple terminal sessions to be accessed simultaneously in a single window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dracula Theme&lt;/strong&gt;: a famous dark theme created by &lt;a href="https://github.com/zenorocha/"&gt;Zeno Rocha&lt;/a&gt;, a Brazilian developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: the following steps are done in Ubuntu. The same result can be achieved in MacOS with iTerm2 as the terminal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#install-guake"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Install Guake
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I worked with MacOS, I used &lt;a href="https://iterm2.com/"&gt;iTerm2&lt;/a&gt;, but now on Linux I am using &lt;a href="http://guake-project.org/"&gt;Guake&lt;/a&gt; as my default terminal. What I look for is to be able to open the command line in any monitor with a simple  &lt;code&gt;CTRL + SPACE&lt;/code&gt; shortcut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you're on Ubuntu, just install it with &lt;code&gt;apt&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;apt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;guake&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose your shortcut&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to Preferences → Keyboard Shortcuts and choose your key to Toggle Guake Visibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change your theme to Dracula&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://draculatheme.com/"&gt;Dracula&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most famous themes out there. I use it both my terminal and VSCode. Guake already comes with it pre-installed, so go to Preferences → Appearance and choose Dracula as a Built-in scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other configs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might also want to change the transparency and height of the window. Check out their documentation for &lt;a href="https://guake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/index.html"&gt;more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KaNCdGSO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qg1qm5r9f3epnda9xei9.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KaNCdGSO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qg1qm5r9f3epnda9xei9.png" alt="Screenshot 1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#zsh-amp-oh-my-zsh"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Zsh &amp;amp; Oh My Zsh
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let's install Z shell in Ubuntu.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;apt &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;zsh
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For other platforms, please check &lt;a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH"&gt;this guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set it as your default shell.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;chsh &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="si"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;which zsh&lt;span class="si"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You will have to logout for the changes to take effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, in Guake go to Preferences → Shell and set your default interpreter to &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin/zsh&lt;/code&gt;. Restart it and you should see the message below. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose option 0. We will be setting this up with Oh My Zsh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OrhenfLI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/btgbxewae6wx53r1gx46.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OrhenfLI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/btgbxewae6wx53r1gx46.png" alt="Screenshot 2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Installing Oh My Zsh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh"&gt;Oh My Zsh&lt;/a&gt; is a framework to manage your Zsh configuration, themes, plugins and much more.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;sh &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;curl &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-fsSL&lt;/span&gt; https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh&lt;span class="si"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the successful installation you should see the screen below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hkKkrSBa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1xzbbv9r6pz5ipwoj8p6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hkKkrSBa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1xzbbv9r6pz5ipwoj8p6.png" alt="Screenshot 3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are now ready to install autocomplete and multiple plugins that will make your life easier. Check out the available plugins at the &lt;a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Plugins"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest you start with the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;zsh-autosuggestions&lt;/code&gt;: makes suggestions based on commands you have already made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;zsh-syntax-highlighting&lt;/code&gt;: enables highlighting of commands while they are typed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clone both plugins to your OhMyZsh custom folder.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions.git
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, edit your &lt;code&gt;~/.zshrc&lt;/code&gt; file to include them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;plugins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=(&lt;/span&gt;
    git
    zsh-autosuggestions
    zsh-syntax-highlighting
&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Restart your Zsh with &lt;code&gt;source ~/.zshrc&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--d0puDEZi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/69tmy7tzr9c2dnaco5fl.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--d0puDEZi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/69tmy7tzr9c2dnaco5fl.png" alt="Screenshot 4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if you start typing, you will see the suggestions and can press &lt;code&gt;tab&lt;/code&gt; to quickly autocomplete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#powerlevel10k"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Powerlevel10k
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k"&gt;Powerlevel10k&lt;/a&gt; is a theme for Zsh. It emphasizes speed, flexibility and out-of-the-box experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Install the required fonts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k-media/raw/master/MesloLGS%20NF%20Regular.ttf"&gt;MesloLGS NF Regular.ttf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k-media/raw/master/MesloLGS%20NF%20Bold.ttf"&gt;MesloLGS NF Bold.ttf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k-media/raw/master/MesloLGS%20NF%20Italic.ttf"&gt;MesloLGS NF Italic.ttf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k-media/raw/master/MesloLGS%20NF%20Bold%20Italic.ttf"&gt;MesloLGS NF Bold Italic.ttf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Configure Guake by opening Preferences → Apperance. Then, uncheck "Use the system fixed width font" and select MesloLGS NF Regular. For more details check their guide &lt;a href="https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#meslo-nerd-font-patched-for-powerlevel10k"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clone the repository&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--depth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git &lt;span class="k"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;ZSH_CUSTOM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;:-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$HOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;/.oh-my-zsh/custom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;/themes/powerlevel10k
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, add powerlevel10k to &lt;code&gt;~/.zshrc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;ZSH_THEME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Restart Zsh with &lt;code&gt;source ~/.zshrc&lt;/code&gt; and follow the configuration wizard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--whNyuSTr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/17cqs4ksd4cft7cs41mr.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--whNyuSTr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/17cqs4ksd4cft7cs41mr.png" alt="Screenshot 5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose your preferred style in the following screens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Av0QipV5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3q8mb8ilqdv1ptijmyov.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Av0QipV5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3q8mb8ilqdv1ptijmyov.png" alt="Screenshot 6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apply the changes to your &lt;code&gt;zshrc&lt;/code&gt; and you're done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--W9mTV5aN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/saxn34r2g808hi0y5doc.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--W9mTV5aN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/saxn34r2g808hi0y5doc.png" alt="Screenshot 7"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will end up with a result like the one below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vOV9L_WT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/t3cq39rnmfc4zjn0gb38.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vOV9L_WT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/t3cq39rnmfc4zjn0gb38.png" alt="Screenshot 8"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tmux-amp-dracula-theme"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tmux &amp;amp; Dracula Theme
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this last section, we will be installing &lt;a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki"&gt;Tmux&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://draculatheme.com/tmux"&gt;Dracula Theme&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;apt &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;tmux
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For other platforms, check &lt;a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Installing"&gt;this guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then run it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;tmux new
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--s-eLTTmz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q124a6mkmsz1skfzazsn.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--s-eLTTmz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q124a6mkmsz1skfzazsn.png" alt="Screenshot 9"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will notice that we have lost the colors we had before. Let's bring them back with the next configs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install &lt;a href="https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm"&gt;tpm&lt;/a&gt; to handle tmux plugins.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Edit &lt;code&gt;~/.tmux.conf&lt;/code&gt; and put this at the bottom.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# List of plugins&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-g&lt;/span&gt; @plugin &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'tmux-plugins/tpm'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-g&lt;/span&gt; @plugin &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'tmux-plugins/tmux-sensible'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Other examples:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;# set -g @plugin 'github_username/plugin_name'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;# set -g @plugin 'git@github.com:user/plugin'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;# set -g @plugin 'git@bitbucket.com:user/plugin'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Initialize TMUX plugin manager (keep this line at the very bottom of tmux.conf)&lt;/span&gt;
run &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'~/.tmux/plugins/tpm/tpm'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reload tmux environment&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# type this in terminal if tmux is already running&lt;/span&gt;
tmux &lt;span class="nb"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; ~/.tmux.conf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, let's install Dracula Theme as a tpm plugin. Add the following to your &lt;code&gt;~/.tmux.conf&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-g&lt;/span&gt; @plugin &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'dracula/tmux'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Set 256 colors&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-s&lt;/span&gt; default-terminal &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'tmux-256color'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Press &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;prefix&amp;gt; + I&lt;/code&gt; (capital i) to install it. The default prefix is &lt;code&gt;ctrl + b&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2_lQN2Wc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/l16m5bdvm1i9qjfrmt1x.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2_lQN2Wc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/l16m5bdvm1i9qjfrmt1x.png" alt="Screenshot 10"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now quit tmux by typing &lt;code&gt;exit&lt;/code&gt; and then create a new session with &lt;code&gt;tmux new&lt;/code&gt;. You should now have Powerlevel10k running with Tmux and Dracula Theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an extra, install the following plugins to save and restore your tmux sessions any time.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-g&lt;/span&gt; @plugin &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-g&lt;/span&gt; @plugin &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'tmux-plugins/tmux-continuum'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And now you should be ready to go! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--T8ztx-Rd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5glgb8epsrjqigc2x9l0.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--T8ztx-Rd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5glgb8epsrjqigc2x9l0.png" alt="Terminal Result"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick commands:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Split panes by pressing &lt;code&gt;prefix + %&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;prefix + "&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kill panes by pressing &lt;code&gt;prefix + x&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switch panes with &lt;code&gt;prefix + arrow&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create new windows by pressing &lt;code&gt;prefix + c&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switch windows by pressing &lt;code&gt;prefix + number&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rename windows with &lt;code&gt;prefix + ,&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zoom in and out a pane with &lt;code&gt;prefix + z&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detach with &lt;code&gt;prefix + d&lt;/code&gt; and reattach with &lt;code&gt;tmux&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Intro
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://30days.appwrite.io/"&gt;#30DaysOfAppwrite&lt;/a&gt; is a month long event focused at giving developers a walk through of all of Appwrite's features, starting from the basics to more advanced features like Cloud Functions! Alongside we will also be building a fully featured Medium Clone to demonstrate how these concepts can be applied when building a real world app. We also have some exciting prizes for developers who follow along with us!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#retrieving-blog-posts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Retrieving Blog Posts
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome back to another session on the Appwrite Database 👋 . We hope you have gone through the &lt;a href="https://dev.to/appwrite/30daysofappwrite-create-user-profiles-1c3m"&gt;Day 17&lt;/a&gt; article. It is important as we build upon the knowledge gained in Day &lt;a href="https://dev.to/appwrite/30daysofappwrite-database-design-140a"&gt;16&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://dev.to/appwrite/30daysofappwrite-create-user-profiles-1c3m"&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;. Now it's time to integrate our main feature into our app, Blog Posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will use the &lt;strong&gt;Post&lt;/strong&gt; Collection to have users create posts that are embedded into their profiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this we need to add several methods to our &lt;code&gt;appwrite.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fetch all Posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fetch all Posts from a User&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fetch a single Post&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create/Edit/Delete a Post&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first method to add is going to be the one that fetches all posts. Technically, we want to retrieve the latest 25 posts with the &lt;a href="https://appwrite.io/docs/client/database?sdk=web#databaseListDocuments"&gt;&lt;code&gt;listDocuments&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; method, sorted from new to old, which have the &lt;code&gt;published&lt;/code&gt; attribute to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; from the server. For this we are going to add following to the &lt;code&gt;appwrite.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;fetchPosts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;limit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;offset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sdk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;database&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;listDocuments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;postsCollection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;published=1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;limit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;offset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;created_at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;DESC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To fetch all Posts from a user, our method is going to look similar - except that we will filter by a User ID in the &lt;code&gt;user_id&lt;/code&gt; attribute:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;fetchUserPosts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;userId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sdk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;database&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;listDocuments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;postsCollection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`user_id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;userId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;published=1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;created_at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;DESC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To fetch a single post, we will use the &lt;a href="https://appwrite.io/docs/client/database?sdk=web#databaseGetDocument"&gt;&lt;code&gt;getDocument&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; method where we can pass an ID, instead of the previously used &lt;a href="https://appwrite.io/docs/client/database?sdk=web#databaseListDocuments"&gt;&lt;code&gt;listDocuments&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;fetchPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sdk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;database&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getDocument&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;postsCollection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And for deleting a post we can use the &lt;a href="https://appwrite.io/docs/client/database?sdk=web#databaseDeleteDocument"&gt;&lt;code&gt;deleteDocument&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; method like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;deletePost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sdk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;database&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;deleteDocument&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;postsCollection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now that we have all the API requests ready to retrieve blog posts, we now need to add Routes and Components for it. For this, we edit the &lt;code&gt;src/routes/Index.svelte&lt;/code&gt; file which will display all blog posts.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;md&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;snarkdown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Loading&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../lib/Loading.svelte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Action&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../lib/Action.svelte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Author&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../lib/Author.svelte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Preview&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../lib/Preview.svelte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../appwrite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetchPosts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;documents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;posts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="na"&gt;promoted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;posts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="na"&gt;featured&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;posts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;slice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="na"&gt;latest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;posts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;slice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

{#await data}
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;Loading&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
{:then { promoted, featured, latest }}
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;section&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"top"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"promoted"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            {#if promoted.cover}
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;{promoted.cover}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;alt=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;{promoted.title}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            {/if}
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{promoted.title}&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;Author&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;user=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;{promoted.user_id}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                {@html md(promoted.text)}
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.75rem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;align-items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="py"&gt;gap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.5rem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;white&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.2s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.cards&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:hover&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#f02e65&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;white&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;scale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1.05&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.card&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.5rem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;object-fit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cover&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this example, the &lt;code&gt;fetchPosts()&lt;/code&gt; method is retrieving that latest 25 posts from our Database and splits them up into the following object structure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Promoted&lt;/strong&gt; - The latest Post&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Featured&lt;/strong&gt; - The next 4 posts subsequent to &lt;strong&gt;Promoted&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Latest&lt;/strong&gt; - All the remaining Posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Day 17 we created a Profile page, but there were no posts yet. To add this feature we will revisit &lt;code&gt;src/routes/Profile.svelte&lt;/code&gt; and update the following code&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Preview&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../lib/Preview.svelte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;MyPost&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../lib/MyPost.svelte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetchUser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetchUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetchPosts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetchUserPosts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;documents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetchUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetchPosts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()]);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    {#await all}
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;Loading&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    {:then [author, posts]}
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;section&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"author"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{author.name}&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        {#if $state.user.$id == params.id}
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;My Posts&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"button"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/create"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;use:link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Create&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;section&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"my-post"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                {#each posts as post}
                    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;MyPost&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;on:deleted=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;{()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; {all = Promise.all([fetchUser(), fetchPosts()]); console.log("deleted")} } {post} /&amp;gt;
                {/each}
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        {:else}
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Latest Posts&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;section&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"latest"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                {#each posts as post}
                    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;Preview&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                {/each}
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        {/if}
    {:catch error}
        {error}
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            Public profile not found
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/profile/create"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;use:link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Create Public Profile&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    {/await}
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are using two components here that haven't been created yet.&lt;code&gt;MyPost&lt;/code&gt; is an editable component that will be shown only to the owner of a post and allow them to edit and delete their posts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;Preview&lt;/code&gt; component on the other hand is a read-only component that will solely be used to display a preview of a blog post.  We will reuse this component in the &lt;code&gt;Index&lt;/code&gt; route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;src/lib/Preview.svelte&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;{`#/post/${post.$id}`}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    {#if post.cover}
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"cover"&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;{post.cover}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;alt=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;{post.title}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    {/if}
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{post.title}&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.cover&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;8rem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now the component to display a single blog post is left. For this we are going to create &lt;strong&gt;src/routes/Post.svelte&lt;/strong&gt; with following content:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;md&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;snarkdown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Loading&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../lib/Loading.svelte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Author&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../lib/Author.svelte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../appwrite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{};&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;postFetch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetchPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;slug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

{#await postFetch}
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;Loading&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
{:then post}
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        {post.title}
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;Author&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;user=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;{post.user_id}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    {#if post.cover}
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"cover"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;{post.cover}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;alt=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;{post.title}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    {/if}
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;section&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"content"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        {@html md(post.text)}
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Comments&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
{/await}

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.cover&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.5rem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.content&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1.1rem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;line-height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2rem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now all blog posts can be read, unfortunately we have no way to verify this as our users lack the ability to create posts. We will take care of this in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-blog-posts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating Blog Posts
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we are going to add the first component which is going to write data to our Appwrite database. For this we are going to add the &lt;code&gt;src/routes/Create.svelte&lt;/code&gt; file and fill it with following content:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin-top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1rem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.alert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#ff000066&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This allows user to create and edit their posts. Now the final step is to add all the components to our router over at &lt;code&gt;src/App.svelte&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//...&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./routes/Post.svelte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Create&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./routes/Create.svelte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//..    &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;routes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//...&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/post/:slug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/post/:slug/edit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Create&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello Developers,&lt;br&gt;
I've prepared a sample Dockerized flask app deployed on Kubernetes on Azure using AKS!&lt;br&gt;
Save your time and run application in different ways :&lt;br&gt;
-As standalone app.&lt;br&gt;
-As a Docker container running on your machine&lt;br&gt;
-Run flask-app-kubernetes repo from Docker Hub:ahmedkhemiri95/flask-app-kubernetes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/ahmedkhemiri95/flask-app-kubernetes"&gt;https://github.com/ahmedkhemiri95/flask-app-kubernetes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
