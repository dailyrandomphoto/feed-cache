      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello my gorgeous friends on the internet, hope you are doing very good, and fancy today, in today's blog, I want to give you the number one tip, that's not a dirty joke, Okay, I'm gonna give you the number one tip that I follow to become a better developer and increase our skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So lets just get in the blog,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number one tip is to create project and stumped you in tutorials. That's the number one tip that you should follow. Whenever you're learning anything development related, whether that be Python, or JavaScript, or development or game development or whatever. That's the number one tip is not to follow tutorials as much as you might think. And to actually start building out the things that you want. And again, this is like so obvious that you might everybody might be like, yeah, mobile, obviously, you want this for building out your tanks. But it's actually a very fine line here. And a lot of people fall into this trap. And you never really realize that, wait, I actually done more tutorials. And I've done projects. And this happened to me a bunch of times, and it's still hard habit to break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't actually put that thing that you learned to the test. Well, it's not going to work out, right. And school, that's probably one of the biggest problems is that you learn everything in memory, you do the test, you get the good score, and then you never use it again. And you're gonna forget. So the number one tip is, again, I'm not saying that don't do tutorials, because tutorials are a great resource to get the basics down. But I'm saying don't fall into that rabbit hole of just doing tutorials because you feel like you're not good enough to start your own project. So my philosophy has always been to start from the basics, just learn from the beginning and just get a good grasp of how that technology works. And how you can put together something super simple. And after that, like literally have to concentrate and take deep breaths, yoga breaths, and be like, Okay, I'm done with the tutorial. That's it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#i-have-a-instagram-theme-page-related-to-programming-you-can-follow-it-if-you-want-to-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  I have a &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/gecko_code/"&gt;Instagram Theme Page&lt;/a&gt; related to programming, you can follow it if you want to :)
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah that's all I got for today, yup its my first blog and pretty small but hope you liked it and learned something :D&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of us have come across terms like multithreading, parallel processing, multiprocessing, concurrency, etc., though each of these terms has its own meaning. In a broader sense, we need these because we want to avoid some kind of latency (or have an illusion of doing so) in the execution of regular programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this, we try to write code that doesn’t necessarily runs in order (non-sequential) and all this boils down to two different concepts — concurrency and parallelism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#concurrency"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Concurrency
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came across concurrency when I was trying to download ~5000 images from the web. I had collected image URLs from Flickr, and these images had to be passed on to a team doing annotation (labelling).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how a sequential program to download images would look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import requests

def download_image(URL, filename):
    image = requests.get(URL)

    with open(f'{filename}.png','wb') as f:
        f.write(image.content)


flickr_URLs = [
    'https://live.staticflickr.com/6022/5941812700_0f634b136e_b.jpg',
    'https://live.staticflickr.com/3379/3492581209_485d2bfafc_b.jpg',

]

for url in flickr_URLs:
    filename = url.split(‘/')[-1]
    download_image(url, filename)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does the job but we spent most of the time waiting for the source URLs to respond. When we scale this program to 5,000 images this “wait time” becomes humongous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above program sends a request to a URL, waits until the image loads (gets response from server), writes it to disk, and only then sends a new request until the list exhausts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, rather than waiting for the first URL to load, shouldn’t we send a new request in the meantime? Once we receive some response from a previously sent request, we can write the corresponding image to the disk. By doing this we are not letting the latency block our main program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can achieve this by starting a new “thread”, along with the main thread using built-in Python module called &lt;code&gt;threading&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how you create a thread:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;thread = threading.Thread(download_image, args=[url, filename])
thread.start()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mFxdMmfQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.pythongasm.com/static/src/007/creating-threads.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mFxdMmfQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.pythongasm.com/static/src/007/creating-threads.png" alt="creating-threads"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s one thread. You need to create many threads, so let’s loop over. Here’s what’s the threaded version of this program would look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import threading
import requests

def download_image(URL, filename):
    ...

flickr_URLs = [...]

threads = []
for url in flickr_URLs:
    filename = url.split('/')[-1]
    thread = threading.Thread(target=download_image, args=[url, filename])
    thread.start()
    threads.append(thread)

for thread in threads:
    thread.join()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We call &lt;code&gt;.join()&lt;/code&gt; on a thread to join it to the main thread — telling Python to wait for a thread to terminate before moving further down in the file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this program, we created 20 threads. But how many threads are too many? If we have 5,000 URLs, should we start 5000 threads?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, you should know that you can start multiple threads but they won’t be running simultaneously. It’s just that while one thread is waiting for some I/O operation, another one starts working in the meantime. &lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--O68AOFpb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://www.pythongasm.com/static/src/007/columnstwoinone.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--O68AOFpb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://www.pythongasm.com/static/src/007/columnstwoinone.gif" alt="juggler"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;It might look like the juggler is juggling two balls but in reality, at any given point he only has one ball in his hand. Source: Library of Juggling&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since your OS continuously switches thread to thread, deciding which one should run at a given time, managing hundreds of threads will eat up a big chunk of resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a simple workaround is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;MAX_THREADS = 10
threads = []
for url in flickr_URLs:
    if len(threads)&amp;gt;MAX_THREADS:
        for thread in threads:
            thread.join()

        threads = []

    filename = url.split('/')[-1]   
    thread = threading.Thread(target=download_image, args=[url, filename])
    thread.start()
    threads.append(thread)

for thread in threads:
    thread.join()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re only starting &lt;code&gt;MAX_THREADS&lt;/code&gt; at once, waiting for them to terminate (we're doing that by calling&lt;code&gt;.join()&lt;/code&gt;), and then starting the next &lt;code&gt;MAX_THREADS&lt;/code&gt; threads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there’s a modern way of doing this which we will see later in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some implementations of Python like PyPy, IronPython can run multiple threads simultaneously but this isn’t the case with the default implementation, that’s CPython.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice how we didn’t need CPU power to speed up this task of downloading images. These are I/O bound tasks — it’s like cooking food, for example.  If you’re preparing a dish, and at some point you need to preheat your microwave oven, you won’t be looking for more manpower to speed up your cooking. You’re better off utilising the preheating time into…maybe chopping down some veggies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kqyY0G0o--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://www.pythongasm.com/static/src/007/concurrency-python-example.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kqyY0G0o--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://www.pythongasm.com/static/src/007/concurrency-python-example.gif" alt="concurrency-python"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Python cutting down veggies while the oven finishes up preheating&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s concurrency. But what if a task is bottlenecked by the CPU, rather than networking and IO? That brings us to parallelism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#parallelism"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Parallelism
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now suppose you’re done with cooking, and it’s time to do the dishes. Can you apply the concept of concurrency here? Pick the knife and start cleaning it, switch over to the bowl you used for pouring milk, start washing it, and then move on to the plates, then back to the knife you were washing some time ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At best, it won’t make any difference to the execution time of this task. And in most of the cases, doing this will make the process slower as you are taking some time in switching back and forth to different utensils (yes, multithreading can also slow down tasks).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to expedite this task, you need manpower. Some friend who washes the bowl while you cleanse knives and forks — more friends, the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how a CPU heavy task looks like, where you can use multiple CPU cores to speed up the task. Let’s try to apply this using Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re trying to find out product of prime numbers upto a number n using a function &lt;code&gt;productOfPrimes&lt;/code&gt;, such that &lt;code&gt;productOfPrimes(10) -&amp;gt; 210&lt;/code&gt; (product of 2, 3, 5, 7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import time

def productOfPrimes(n):

    ALL_PRIMES_UPTO_N = []

    for i in range(2, n):

        PRIME = True
        for j in range(2, int(i/2)+1):
            if i%j==0:
                PRIME = False
                break

        if PRIME:
            ALL_PRIMES_UPTO_N.append(i)


    print(f"{len(ALL_PRIMES_UPTO_N)} PRIME NUMBERS FOUND")

    product = 1
    for prime in ALL_PRIMES_UPTO_N:
        product = product*prime

    return product

init_time = time.time()
LIMITS = [50328,22756,39371,44832]

for lim in LIMITS: 
    productOfPrimes(lim)

fin_time = time.time()
print(f"TIME TAKEN: {fin_time-init_time}")
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nested loops, lots of division — pretty heavy on the CPU. The execution took ~10 seconds on 1.1 GHz quad core Intel i5 processor. However, out of 4 cores, we just used one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To manage multiple cores and processes, we use this module called &lt;code&gt;multiprocessing&lt;/code&gt; in python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s see if multiprocessing improves this result. Syntactically, it’s quite similar to how we started threads:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import multiprocessing

def productOfPrimes():
    …

if __name__ == "__main__":  
    processes = []
    LIMITS = [50328,22756,39371,44832] 

    for lim in LIMITS:
        process = multiprocessing.Process(target=productOfPrimes, args=[lim])
        process.start()
        processes.append(process)

    for process in processes:
        process.join()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does the same thing in a little over 4 seconds. &lt;code&gt;productOfPrimes&lt;/code&gt; was simulatenously executed on multiple cores available in the CPU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let's talk a bit about numbers. How many processes can a quad-core CPU can execute simultaneously? Shouldn't it be only 4? Yes, but that doesn't mean the OS can't hold more than 4 processes in memory. There's a difference in executing processes and just holding them in memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run this bash command to see the number of processes running on your system:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ps -e | wc -l
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you start 20 processes from Python, it won't throw an error saying you don't have enough cores. The OS will just manage these 20 processes over whatever cores are available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pool-of-threads-and-processes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Pool of Threads and Processes
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen how we can implement the concepts of concurrency and parallelism using threading and multiprocessing modules. However, we’ve a sexier, more Pythonic way of doing this using the concurrent.futures module (ships with Python).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import concurrent.futures

def download_image(URL, filename):
    ...

flickr_URLs = [...]
with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
    results = executor.map(download_image, flickr_URLs)

for result in results:
        print(result)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can do something similar using &lt;code&gt;ProcessPoolExecutor&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import concurrent.futures

def productOfPrimes(n):
    ...

LIMITS = [...]

if __name__ == "__main__": 
    with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor:
        results = executor.map(productOfPrimes, LIMITS)

for result in results:
    print(result)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XCyanxkx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.pythongasm.com/static/src/007/concurrent.futures-python.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XCyanxkx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.pythongasm.com/static/src/007/concurrent.futures-python.png" alt="concurrent.futures"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#threads-processes-os"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Threads, Processes, OS
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically, threads run inside a process. When we create 4 threads, they share the same process, thus the same memory, and a lot of other OS level stuff (process control block, address space, etc.). The same is not true for processes. Each process has memory space of its own and run independently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, processes can run simultaneously — unlike in multithreading where the OS just keeps switching over and over to manage latency inside the same process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen how we can implement concurrency and parallelism in Python which are fundamentally very different, and have use cases of their own. There are more things to talk about like problems with threading, GIL, asynchronicity, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

  definition of interpolation search
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Interpolation Search is an improvement over Binary Search for instances, where the values in a sorted array are uniformly distributed. Binary Search always goes to the middle element to check. On the other hand, interpolation search may go to different locations according to the value of the key being searched. For example, if the value of the key is closer to the last element, interpolation search is likely to start search toward the end side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the formula of interpolation search is:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;pos = low + ((x – A[low]) * (high – low) // (A[high] – A[low]))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you wanna get a bit more in depth on the differences between the ways of declaring variables with  &lt;strong&gt;var&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;let&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;const&lt;/strong&gt;, then this is the article for you. We will be learn about scoping, features, and other important things we should really know about when declaring variables for our data. Let's take a step back and freshen up our javascript variable knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In javascript we are allowed to store &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt; values / types in what we know as &lt;em&gt;variable_names&lt;/em&gt; or in technical terms &lt;em&gt;identifiers&lt;/em&gt;. It's easier for the developer to work with data when we give it a name and can pass it any where in our code simply by using its variable name. When we want to declare a variable we have the options to choose from three keywords &lt;em&gt;var&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;let&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;const&lt;/em&gt;. Each have there pros and cons on when to be used but it really comes down to it on how your data will work. We will dig a bit more in depth on each of these keywords to understand what the differences are and when to use the proper declarations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#declaring-variables-with-var"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Declaring variables with var
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we were introduced into ES6 (modern javascript) there was only one way to declare variables and that was with the &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; keyword, also there was no other way to declare constants either. But luckily for us the &lt;em&gt;syntax&lt;/em&gt; for declaring variables are all alike. Even though they have the same &lt;em&gt;syntax&lt;/em&gt; they have important differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Variables when declared with &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; do not have a block scope, instead they are &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; scoped. If we were to take &lt;em&gt;MDN&lt;/em&gt;'s definition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MDN : "The scope of a variable declared with var is its current execution context and closures thereof, which is either the enclosing function and functions declared within it, or, for variables declared outside any function, global."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meaning no matter how deep nested the variables are, if they are declared inside a function they stay within the scope of that function.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;var x = 'xyz';
var name = 'oscar';
var age = 25;
var data = [];

// can be declared in a single line statement too
var name = 'oscar', age = 25, data = [];
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you do decided to declare a variable outside a function, globals declared with &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; are implemented as properties to the &lt;code&gt;globalObject&lt;/code&gt;. You can go inside your dev tools and access the console, while on the console declare a variable globally and access it with the &lt;code&gt;globalThis&lt;/code&gt; object like so.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;var x = 2; // global variable

function greet(str) {
   const name = str; // body scoped variable

   return "Hello" + name
}

console.log(globalThis.x); // output 2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It's strange to say that you can have duplicates variable names when declared with &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; and won't trigger any errors even in &lt;em&gt;strict mode&lt;/em&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#declaring-variables-with-let"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Declaring variables with let
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In modern &lt;em&gt;javascript&lt;/em&gt; we declare variables with the &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; keyword, which has a block-scope, it does not create properties of the &lt;code&gt;globalObject&lt;/code&gt; when declared globally. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;let name = 'oscar';
let i = 0;
let o; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you don't assign any value to your declared &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; variable, it will still be declared but will be &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt;. Meaning the variable exists but has no &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt;. You can also declare multiple variables with a single &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; statement.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;let a = 0,b = 12,c = 4;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The main difference between &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; is the power of &lt;code&gt;scope&lt;/code&gt;. Here is an example of seeing them both in action.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;var x = 'global';
let y = 'global';

console.log(this.x); // "global"
console.log(this.y); // undefined
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; variables on the other hand are allowed to have their values changed unlike our other keyword &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; which will give us an &lt;em&gt;error&lt;/em&gt; if we tried to change it's when already declared. So if you know that your data is going to be dynamic, you can save your from future bugs that sometimes are very hard to spot because of the way we declared our variables. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#declaring-variables-with-const"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Declaring variables with const
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's important to not that the major difference when declaring with &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; is that the values can not be changed once they have been declared, can not be re-assigned, otherwise it will throw a &lt;code&gt;TypeError&lt;/code&gt;. But just like the &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; keyword, when declared globally it will not become a property of the &lt;code&gt;window&lt;/code&gt; object unlike &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; variables. But it is &lt;em&gt;required&lt;/em&gt; to initialize the when its declared, cause again you can not re-assign or change data of a &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; in the future, which makes sense on why you need to initialize it right away.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const name = 'oscar';
const age = 25;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one approach, we use const only for values that must not change. In the other, we use const for any value that does not happen to change. I prefer the former approach in my own code.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
David Flanagan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope by the end of this article you managed to learn how to create and understood what is going on in every line of code. It is very important to understand how your code fully works, not only does it help you become a better developer but can also help you use the tools you are working with more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These articles are mostly intended for personal use on becoming a better programmer, writer, and grow my programming skills. Feel free to drop any feedback or corrections that you believe that should be made to help me and others. Thank you for your time for sticking this far! &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ESLint: What, Why, When, How</title>
      <author>Shivam Gupta</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 19 Jun 2021 18:26:41 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-eslint"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is ESLint?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ESLint is an open-source Javascript linting utility originally created by Nicholas C. Zakas in June 2013. It is frequently used to find problematic patterns or code that doesn’t adhere to certain style guidelines. ESLint is written using Node.js to provide a fast runtime environment and easy installation via npm.&lt;br&gt;
With ESLint you can impose the coding standard using a certain set of standalone rules. Yes, you can turn those rules on and off. These rules are completely pluggable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-use-eslint"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why use ESLint?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript, being a dynamic and loosely-typed language, is especially prone to developer error. ESLint lets you put guidelines over coding standard and helps you to minimize those errors. The main reason for imposing those guide is because every developer has her style of writing (like naming conventions/tabs/single or double quotes for a string). And, with different styling techniques, your codebase may look weird, more error-prone and vulnerable. Especially when you’re dealing with Javascript this could cause pitfalls you’d never want to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#when-to-use-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  When to use it?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I prefer to use it no matter the project size or the team. But you should consider having it for any medium to large-scaled non-trivial Javascript/Typescript project or/and you’ve got quite a team of developers to deal with. In either case, you have to impose common, standard coding practice/guidelines.&lt;br&gt;
Linting tools like ESLint allow developers to discover problems with their JavaScript code without executing it. One of the main the reason for ESLint was created was to allow developers to create their own linting rules. You can use ESLint in any application that runs on Javascript/Typescript:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;React/React Native&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Angular&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Node.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-use-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to use it?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enough talk, eh? Here’s how you can install it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#install-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Install it
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prerequisites: Node.js &lt;code&gt;(^10.12.0, or &amp;gt;=12.0.0)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You can install ESLint using &lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;yarn&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ npm install eslint --save-dev
# or
$ yarn add eslint --dev
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Note: It is also possible to install ESLint globally rather than locally (using &lt;code&gt;npm install eslint --global&lt;/code&gt;). However, this is NOT recommended, and any plugins or shareable configs that you use must be installed locally in either case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#initialize-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Initialize it
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After installing it, initialize it with the following command:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ npx eslint --init
# or
$ yarn run eslint --init
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Note: &lt;code&gt;— init&lt;/code&gt; assumes you have a package.json file already. If you don’t, make sure to run npm init or yarn init beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#configure-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Configure it
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moment you’re done with the installation and initialization you’ll have a .eslintrc.{js,yml,json} file in your directory. In it, you’ll see some rules configured like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
    "rules": {
        "semi": ["error", "always"],
        "quotes": ["error", "double"]
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#use-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Use it
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re here that means you’ve successfully configured the ESLint. Here’s how you can use it:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ npx elinst &amp;lt;your file&amp;gt;.js
# or 
$ npx eslint &amp;lt;folder containing js files&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can also add lint in yourpackage.json file (if not already added)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;"scripts": {
  ...
  "lint": "eslint .",
  ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#congrats"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Congrats!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve successfully made your codebase look a lot cleaner and better than ever in just a few steps.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Feel like a secret agent: Hidden messages in images with steganography 🖼️🕵️‍♀️</title>
      <author>Pascal Thormeier</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/thormeier/feel-like-a-secret-agent-hidden-messages-in-images-with-steganography-37kh</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;James Bond, Ethan Hunt, Napoleon Solo - secret agents working in disguise, sending secret messages to their employer and other agents. Let's be honest, secret agents are cool. At least in the movies and books. They get awesome gadgets, hunt down villains, get to visit fancy clubs with fancy clothes. And at the end of they day, they save the world. When I was a kid, I would've loved to be a secret agent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I'm going to show you a technique that might well be used by secret agents to hide images within other images: Steganography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#but-first-whats-steganography-anyways"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  But first: What's steganography anyways?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steganography could be something invented by the famous engineer Q of MI6 in "James Bond" movies, but it's actually much older! Hiding messages or images from eyes that shouldn't see them was a thing since the ancient times already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Wikipedia, in 440 BC, Herodotus, an ancient Greek writer, once shaved the head of one of his most loyal servants to write a message on their bald head and sent the servant to the recipient once their hair grew back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're not going to shave anyone today, let alone hide messages on each others heads. Instead, we're hiding an image in another image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this, we get rid of insignificant parts of the colors of one image and replace it with the significant parts of the colors of another image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#wait-what-significant-insignificant"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Wait, what? Significant, insignificant?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand what that means, we first need to know how colors work, for example, in PNG. Web devs might be familiar with the hex notations of colors, such as &lt;code&gt;#f60053&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;#16ee8a&lt;/code&gt;. A hex color consists of four different parts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; as a prefix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two hex digits for red&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two hex digits for green&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two hex digits for blue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the values can go from &lt;code&gt;00&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;FF&lt;/code&gt; for each color, this means it's going from &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;255&lt;/code&gt; in decimal. In binary, it would go from &lt;code&gt;00000000&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;11111111&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Binary works very similar to decimal: The further left a single digit is, the higher it's value. The "significance" of a bit therefore increases, the further left it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example: &lt;code&gt;11111111&lt;/code&gt; is almost twice as large as &lt;code&gt;01111111&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;11111110&lt;/code&gt; on the other hand is only slightly smaller. A human eye most likely won't notice the difference betweeen &lt;code&gt;#FFFFFF&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;#FEFEFE&lt;/code&gt;. It will notice the difference between &lt;code&gt;#FFFFFF&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;#7F7F7F&lt;/code&gt;, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lets-hide-an-image-with-js"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Let's hide an image with JS
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's hide this stock image:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nxSj2H49--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0jot4yko32tc5o3ej8xu.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nxSj2H49--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0jot4yko32tc5o3ej8xu.png" alt="A stock image of a computer with some CLI output"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in this cat image:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mWjpVPi---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kggvmlnuwti4w9pdot2o.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mWjpVPi---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kggvmlnuwti4w9pdot2o.png" alt="A fluffy orange cat"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im going to write a little Node script to hide an image in another. This means my script needs to take three arguments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The main image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The hidden image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The destination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's code this out first:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;argv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;slice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mainImagePath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hiddenImagePath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;targetImagePath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Usage:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// node hide-image.js ./cat.png ./hidden.png ./target.png&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So far so good. Now I'll install &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/image-size"&gt;image-size&lt;/a&gt; to get the size of the main image and &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas"&gt;canvas for node&lt;/a&gt; to inspect the images  and generate a new image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let's find out the dimensions of the main image and the secret image and create canvasses for both of them. I'll also create a canvas for the output image:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;imageSize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;image-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createCanvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;loadImage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;canvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;argv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;slice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mainImagePath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hiddenImagePath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;targetImagePath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sizeMain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;imageSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;mainImagePath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sizeHidden&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;imageSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hiddenImagePath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;canvasMain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createCanvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sizeMain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sizeMain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;canvasHidden&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createCanvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sizeHidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sizeHidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;canvasTarget&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createCanvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sizeMain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sizeMain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;contextMain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;canvasMain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;2d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;contextHidden&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;canvasHidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;2d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;contextTarget&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;canvasTarget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;2d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, I need to load both images into their respective canvasses. Since these methods return promises, I put the rest of the code in an immediately invoked function expression that allows for async/await:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mainImage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;loadImage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;mainImagePath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;contextMain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;drawImage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;mainImage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sizeMain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sizeMain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hiddenImage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;loadImage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hiddenImagePath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;contextHidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;drawImage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hiddenImage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sizeHidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sizeHidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, I iterate over every single pixel of the images and get their color values:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sizeHidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sizeHidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;colorMain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;contextMain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getImageData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;colorHidden&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;contextHidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getImageData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With these values, I can now calculate the "combined" color of every pixel that I'm going to draw into the target image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#calculating-the-new-color"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Calculating the new color
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said something about significant bits earlier. To actually calculate the color, let me illustrate this a bit further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say, I want to combine the red parts of colors A and B. I'll represent their bits (8bit) as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;A7 A6 A5 A4 A3 A2 A1 A0 (color A)
B7 B6 B5 B4 B3 B2 B1 B0 (color B)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To hide the color B in the color A, I replace the first (right most), lets say, 3 bits of A with the last (left most) bits of B. The resulting bit pattern would look like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;A7 A6 A5 A4 A3 B7 B6 B5
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This means, I lose some information of both colors, but the combined color will not look much different than the color B itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's code this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;combineColors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;aBinary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;padStart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;bBinary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;padStart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;parseInt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;aBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;aBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;aBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;aBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;aBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;bBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;bBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;bBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I can now use that function in the pixel loop:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;colorMain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;contextMain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getImageData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;colorHidden&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;contextHidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getImageData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;combinedColor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;combineColors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;colorMain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;colorHidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]),&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;combineColors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;colorMain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;colorHidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]),&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;combineColors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;colorMain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;colorHidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]),&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;contextTarget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fillStyle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`rgb(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;combinedColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;combinedColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;combinedColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;)`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;contextTarget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fillRect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Almost there, now I only need to save the resulting image:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;buffer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;canvasTarget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toBuffer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;image/png&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;writeFileSync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;targetImagePath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;buffer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And here's the result:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nmYLpX7i--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c6i6fx9eposz68hiparc.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nmYLpX7i--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c6i6fx9eposz68hiparc.png" alt="An image hidden in the cat image from above"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on your screen settings, you might see the pattern of the hidden image in the top half of the image. Usually, you would use an image that obfuscates the hidden image more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#and-how-do-i-restore-the-hidden-image"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  And how do I restore the hidden image?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To extract the hidden image, all that's necessary is to read out the last 3 bits of each pixel and make them the most significant bits again:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;extractColor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cBinary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;padStart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;parseInt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cBinary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;00000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If I do this for every single pixel, I get the original image again (plus a few artifacts):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yuQpRN0w--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ijrlpe9vww27bpy11g3n.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yuQpRN0w--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ijrlpe9vww27bpy11g3n.png" alt="Original image in lower quality"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can feel like a real secret agent by hiding images and sending hidden messages to other secret agents!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Understanding Time Complexity</title>
      <author>Evan</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 19 Jun 2021 17:57:39 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/evandaley/time-complexity-for-dummies-3aid</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#intro"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Intro
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To set the stage - pretend you have an array with &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; elements, and you have some code that does something to that array. The length of time it takes the program to run might be proportional to the length of the array. If the array has 100 items, and you loop over the array 100 times, you are doing roughly 10,000 operations. Looking at Big O Notation gives you a way to classify that operation. Generally O(n) is considered okay, and O(n^2) is bad!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might seem scary at first but really isn't too bad once you get the hang of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone asks about time complexity, they usually want you to categorize the code in one of these groups:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;O(1) - Constant time complexity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;O(n) - Linear time complexity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;O(n^2) - Quadratic time complexity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;O(log n) - Logarithmic time complexity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#constant-time-o1"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Constant Time: O(1)
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a simple operation that runs immediately, regardless of the length of the array.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;console.log("The first item is:", items[0])
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Use case: Doing something simple, one time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#linear-time-on"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Linear Time: O(n)
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine you have an array of numbers and you want to double each item. To do that, you would just need to touch each number once. The length of time it takes the program to run is proportional to the length of the array. 15 items means your program does roughly 15 operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_5HeKLih--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q8fenlkgpi6eng46vdgm.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_5HeKLih--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q8fenlkgpi6eng46vdgm.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the length of the array goes up, the execution time goes up proportionally. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets visualize that with some code:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;let numbers = [0, 4, 10, 12]
for (let i = 0; i &amp;lt; numbers.length; i++) {
  numbers[i] = numbers[i] * 2
}
console.log(numbers)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since we hit each item once, the execution time correspond 1-to-1 with the length of the array. This is known as linear time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use case: Any situation where you need to go through an array up to one time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples: &lt;code&gt;.map&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.filter&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.reduce&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.some&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#quadratic-time-on2"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Quadratic Time: O(n^2)
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now imagine that for some reason, you have to loop through the list completely, one time for every item in the list. That might look something like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;let numbers = [0, 4, 10, 12]
for (let i = 0; i &amp;lt; numbers.length; i++) {
  for (let j = 0; j &amp;lt; numbers.length; j++) {
    const a = numbers[i]
    const b = numbers[j]
    const product = a * b
    console.log(`${a} times ${b} = ${product}`)
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since that list has 4 items, and we loop over the whole list 4 times, we end up with 16 total operations (4^2). The length of time it takes to run the program is roughly proportional to the length of the array &lt;em&gt;multiplied by itself&lt;/em&gt;. This is known as O(n^2). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, if you have a for-loop inside another for-loop and they both have length n, the answer is O(n^2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use case: Bubble Sort, checking for duplicates, finding all possible pairs, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#logarithmic-time-olog-n"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Logarithmic Time: O(log n)
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last big one to pay attention to is O(log n). Its a little trickier to explain the math behind this one, but this one applies to most algorithms that divide and conquer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets say someone picks a number at random from this list &lt;code&gt;[1, 3, 13, 43, 46, 52, 58, 63, 72]&lt;/code&gt;, and you're trying to guess their number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mathmatically, the fastest way to pick the right number is to cut the results in half with each guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start in the middle. We pick &lt;code&gt;46&lt;/code&gt;. That number is too small. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, we know the number is in the list &lt;code&gt;[52, 58, 63, 72]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets cut that in half again. We guess &lt;code&gt;58&lt;/code&gt;. That number is too large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we know the number is &lt;code&gt;52&lt;/code&gt; since thats the only thing left (smaller than &lt;code&gt;58&lt;/code&gt; and larger than &lt;code&gt;46&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The act of dividing the data set in half each time guarantees that we find a result in a certain number of guess. With 9 elements in our array, we know we'll find the answer within 4 guesses (log2(9)). For a dataset of length n, the answer will always be found within log2(n) guesses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing you really need to remember about this one is that it applies to divide and conquer algorithms. Anything like binary search that cuts the results in half each time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use case: Binary search, Divide and conquer, most recursive algorithms, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#final-notes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Final Notes
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thats pretty much it. Being comfortable with those 3 should cover you in like 99% of interview questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#further-study"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Further Study
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some questions also ask about space complexity. This is the same premise, but they want to know how much space is required for the solution. Are you creating a full copy of the array? That would be O(n) space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there is one other classification of time complexity that comes up very rarely: O(n * log n). &lt;br&gt;
The premise is that you loop over the whole array, and for each item, do some kind of O(log n) operation. It comes up with partitioning and quicksort but thats about it. Its basically just as bad as O(n^2) but with extra steps, and its just slightly better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to go deeper, this article does a pretty good job covering more scenarios.&lt;br&gt;

      <title>JavaScript for Web Development</title>
      <author>KUMAR HARSH</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 19 Jun 2021 17:50:18 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/cenacr007_harsh/javascript-for-web-development-2c22</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/cenacr007_harsh/javascript-for-web-development-2c22</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This blog is inspired by the Tweet by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Prathkum"&gt;Pratham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more amazing content do follow him on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let's dive into the blog: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JavaScript&lt;/strong&gt; is an enormous language but you don't need to learn everything in the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the detailed explanation on JavaScript for Web Development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript is a kind of language that as you progress deeper in the field, you will come to know a lot more cool concepts about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prerequisites if you want to learn JavaScript for web development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HTML&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, it's a programming language so you should know about basic programming concepts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data types in JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Variables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Statements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control statements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And other basic stuff....&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know programming beforehand and have some experience in any programming language like C, C++, Java, Python etc. then this should not be hard for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you can start with the &lt;strong&gt;ZERO&lt;/strong&gt; knowledge as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some advanced topics in JavaScript which you don't need to learn in the beginning. For ex:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Async/await&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;callbacks, promises, etc...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are some advance concept which you can learn after you have a decent knowledge of JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to cover some intermediate topics so that you can add behaviour to your website. They are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arrays and their methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arrow function&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These will help you to work with DOM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Id1krQ8m--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kob6c1kmtz8bcp3y8fsj.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Id1krQ8m--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kob6c1kmtz8bcp3y8fsj.png" alt="dom"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's talk about &lt;strong&gt;DOM&lt;/strong&gt; a little bit. It stands for &lt;strong&gt;Document Object Model&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider it as a tree that comprises the content of a particular web page (HTML)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--V7fDCWIn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/w4omwdz6s0e480o7dvz1.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--V7fDCWIn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/w4omwdz6s0e480o7dvz1.jpg" alt="dom2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript and DOM are connected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use DOM to access the elements but write JavaScript code in order to modify them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a simple example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2ZhcHCz2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xe15hif5zcz3oewisrss.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2ZhcHCz2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xe15hif5zcz3oewisrss.png" alt="para"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't get confused here. DOM is not a programming language it's just a model using which we can access and modify HTML elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basic things you need to cover in DOM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#finding-html-elements"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Finding HTML Elements
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;getElementsByTagName()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;getElementsById()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;getElementsByClassName()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#changing-html-element"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Changing HTML Element
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;element.innerHTML&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;element.attribute&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;element .style.property&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;element.setAttribute&lt;/code&gt;(attr, value)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#adding-and-deleting-elements"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Adding and deleting elements
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;document.createElement(element)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;document.removeChild(element)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;document.appendChild(element)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just one last thing and then you will be able to make fully-fledged websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After learning these basic properties and methods, its time to move onto Events and Event Listener&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;addEventListener()&lt;/code&gt; method attaches an event handler to the specified element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to this point you will able to make a fully functional website using JavaScript. But there are always some margin of improvement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some advanced key concepts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hoisting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Closures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Callbacks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Async &amp;amp; Await&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Currying&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And other ES6,ES7 features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project-based learning is the best. &lt;a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-projects-for-beginners/"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; are some practice projects you can build&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live Streaming is becoming an increasingly popular form of entertainment. As it grows, streamers have looked for more ways to interact with their fans. Through creating systems to automatically allow their fans to interact, streamers have created viral sensations such as Twitch Plays Pokemon, in which commenters can play Pokemon by typing specific commands in chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, we are going to build a basic Twitch Chat Game that reads Twitch comments and uses them to allow a player to interact with the web app. While we aren't going to get too fancy in terms of what we make, we will go over the building blocks for you to make the next big Twitch game!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to follow along line by line, you can find the source code here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/LiorB-D/TwitchChatGame"&gt;https://github.com/LiorB-D/TwitchChatGame&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you'd like to quickly try out the game, you can test out a demo on Codesphere right here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.codesphere.com/AE"&gt;https://codesphere.com/#https://github.com/LiorB-D/TwitchChatGame&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the app loads in, just enter your twitch channel on line 45 of index.html and run&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;node server.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9DVKHjGl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3149xomjz8eh95ecjura.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9DVKHjGl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3149xomjz8eh95ecjura.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tools-well-be%C2%A0using"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tools We'll Be Using
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tools we are going to use in this tutorial are relatively straightforward, though you may need additional libraries and frameworks depending on what kind of game or Twitch bot you are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tmijs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tmi.js
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the cornerstone of our interaction with Twitch chat is going to be a library called tmi.js.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://tmijs.com/"&gt;https://tmijs.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tmi.js is a well-documented javascript package that allows you to read and write to a Twitch chat. While there are a few ways to access it, including an NPM package and a ReactJS wrapper, we'll be using a static Javascript file to access tmi.js. You can download that Javascript file here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/tmijs/tmi.js/releases/download/v1.8.3/tmi.min.js"&gt;https://github.com/tmijs/tmi.js/releases/download/v1.8.3/tmi.min.js&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#p5js"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  P5.js
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, in order to create the graphics for our very simple game, we will use p5.js, an easy-to-use graphics library for javascript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://p5js.org/"&gt;https://p5js.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can access p5.js via the following CDN:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script
src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/1.1.9/p5.min.js" integrity="sha512-WIklPM6qPCIp6d3fSSr90j+1unQHUOoWDS4sdTiR8gxUTnyZ8S2Mr8e10sKKJ/bhJgpAa/qG068RDkg6fIlNFA=="
crossorigin="anonymous"
&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#codesphere"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Codesphere
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we'll be developing and deploying our app with Codesphere. Codesphere is a zero-config cloud provider that offers a Web IDE directly on its platform, in order to make deployment much more seamless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.codesphere.com/AB"&gt;https://codesphere.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't wish to deploy your app, all of the steps in this tutorial will work in your text editor of choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-well-be%C2%A0making"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What We'll Be Making
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep things simple, we'll be creating an extremely simple, yet fun game for our twitch viewers to play. Here's how it works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A viewer comments "join" to enter the game. They will then see their name on the screen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each round, viewers will comment "A", "B", "C", or "D", and be placed in a corresponding box on a 2x2 grid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5kxbanG8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ip0klusggq4hm3550lu3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5kxbanG8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ip0klusggq4hm3550lu3.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the round timer is over, a box is chosen at random and all players in that box are eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rounds continue until no more people are left standing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, a lot more can be added to increase your viewers' involvement and entertainment, but this roulette-esque game will be easy to make and allow us to focus on reading Twitch chat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setting-up-our-express-serveroptional"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setting up our Express Server(Optional)
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the game itself is going to be using static HTML and Javascript files, we can create an Express server very quickly in order to serve our game&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, initialize your npm project with:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;npm init&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After entering the details for your project, install ExpressJS with:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;npm i express&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once that is done, create &lt;code&gt;server.js&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;, and a public folder for us to put our &lt;code&gt;TMI.js&lt;/code&gt; file in. Your file tree should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1GSB1RdK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/a1te2h8480ryh1jrfosr.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1GSB1RdK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/a1te2h8480ryh1jrfosr.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your &lt;code&gt;server.js&lt;/code&gt; file, place the following code to serve our page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/LiorB-D/c39b3506840b0419340afac03f456a01"&gt;https://gist.github.com/LiorB-D/c39b3506840b0419340afac03f456a01&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the following code which was used to listen to the Twitch chat:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/LiorB-D/f30942dc11f94887fa40e3d1aac637ec"&gt;https://gist.github.com/LiorB-D/f30942dc11f94887fa40e3d1aac637ec&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#next-steps"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Next Steps
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you have it! We then have the full power of Javascript to make Twitch chat games! The possibilities for viewer interaction are endless!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some cool things you can make with tmi.js and Javascript include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow Twitch Chat to play Chess against you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate Spotify with Nodejs and let your viewers queue songs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let your viewers compete against each other in an .io type game for prizes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tweet at us the cool things you build @CodesphereCloud!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy coding from your good friends at Codesphere, the next generation cloud provider&lt;/p&gt;

Dockerzing a Python Django Web App on Ubuntu 21.04</title>
      <author>Gautam Ankul</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 19 Jun 2021 17:25:01 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/gautamankul/dickerzing-a-python-django-web-app-on-ubuntu-21-04-54o7</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/gautamankul/dickerzing-a-python-django-web-app-on-ubuntu-21-04-54o7</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey Developer!Today we're learn dockerize a django application on ubuntu It's worked all linux distro ...&lt;br&gt;
This article covered a simple hello world django application In which we talk about Docker&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prerequisite-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  prerequisite :
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.Ubuntu (any linux Distro)&lt;br&gt;
2.Python Pip, the package manager&lt;br&gt;
3.Python2 and Python3 &lt;br&gt;
4.Docker&lt;br&gt;
5.Django&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Docker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Use of Docker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When building web applications, you have probably reached a point where you want to run your application in a fashion that is closer to your production environment. Docker allows you to set up your application runtime in such a way that it runs in exactly the same manner as it will in production, on the same operating system, with the same environment variables, and any other configuration and setup you require.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Means,Docker facilitate to Developer to work with from another existing project own system Docker container holds the entire package of application with own resources. like below example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FUn0Nvjk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9ocsc4e2gxfifpytb02x.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FUn0Nvjk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9ocsc4e2gxfifpytb02x.jpeg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we are going for Docker installation in Ubuntu for that follow official link .&lt;a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/"&gt;Docker Installation Link &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check Docker version in your system like &lt;code&gt;$ docker --version&lt;/code&gt; if it show like this &lt;code&gt;Docker version 20.10.7, build f0df350&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/code&gt; mean docker installed your system&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create Django Project in Pip Environment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us, make a directory and install pipenv in that directory&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ mkdir docker-project &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cd docker-project

$ pipenv install django

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now we Activate our Environment .&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ pipenv shell

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now We are create a Django project and Django app..&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ django-admin startproject hello-project .

$ cd hello-project

$ python3 manage.py startapp pages

$ python3 manage.py migrate

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now We are going to runserver for all set..&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ python3 manage.py runserver

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It's look like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xla0YOhe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/87l3v6ym2ziwqkrxt7ow.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xla0YOhe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/87l3v6ym2ziwqkrxt7ow.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Now we are configure file and render &lt;code&gt;hello world&lt;/code&gt; on web page let get start..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change in setting.py:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;# hello_project/settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
'django.contrib.admin',
'django.contrib.auth',
'django.contrib.contenttypes',
'django.contrib.sessions',
'django.contrib.messages',
'django.contrib.staticfiles',
'pages.apps.PagesConfig', # new

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;2.Change in hello-project urls.py:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we can set the URL route for the pages app. Since we want our message to appear&lt;br&gt;
on the homepage we’ll use the empty string '' . Don’t forget to add the include import&lt;br&gt;
on the second line as well&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;# hello_project/urls.py

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include # new
urlpatterns = [
path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
path('', include('pages.urls')), # new
]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change in pages view.py:
Rather than set up a template at this point we can just hardcode a message in our
view layer at pages/views.py which will output the string “Hello, World!”.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;# pages/views.py

from django.http import HttpResponse
def home_page_view(request):
    return HttpResponse('Hello, World!')
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Note:We are create a file in pages (app directory) which name should be &lt;code&gt;urls.py&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.Change in page urls.py:&lt;br&gt;
Within your text editor import path on the top line, add the home_page_view , and then&lt;br&gt;
set its route to again be the empty string of '' . Note that we also provide an optional&lt;br&gt;
name, home , for this route which is a best practice.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;# pages/urls.py

from django.urls import path
from .views import home_page_view
urlpatterns = [
path('', home_page_view, name='home')
]

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here we are done for configure and runserver and see like this page.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ python3 manage.py runserver
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HE5FXa3i--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dx3a08i83x8vy0fs92m6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HE5FXa3i--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dx3a08i83x8vy0fs92m6.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;
  &lt;a href="#notice-now-are-exit-the-django-virtual-environment-for-docker-configuration-for-quit-pipenv"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Notice: Now are exit the  Django virtual environment for docker configuration for quit pipenv.
&lt;/h6&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;(docker-project)$ exit
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s create our first &lt;code&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt; to see all of this theory in action.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ touch Dockerfile

$ touch docker-compose.yml 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#note-here-dockerfile-name-should-be-raw-d-endraw-in-capital-letter-and-project-file-structure-must-be-like-following-image"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Note: Here Dockerfile name should be &lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt; in Capital letter. And Project file structure must be like following image.
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---BwPHlRJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ipr8gzkexqo7kz8tqfm1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---BwPHlRJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ipr8gzkexqo7kz8tqfm1.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Docerfile

#pull base image
FROM python:3.9
# Set environment variables
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE 1
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1
# Set work directory
WORKDIR /code
# Install dependencies
COPY Pipfile Pipfile.lock /code/
RUN pip install pipenv &amp;amp;&amp;amp; pipenv install --system
# Copy project
COPY . /code/

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#description"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Description:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dockerfiles are read from top-to-bottom when an image is created. The first instruc-&lt;br&gt;
tion must be the FROM command which lets us import a base image to use for our&lt;br&gt;
image, in this case Python 3.9.&lt;br&gt;
Then we use the ENV command to set two environment variables:&lt;br&gt;
• PYTHONUNBUFFERED ensures our console output looks familiar and is not buffered&lt;br&gt;
by Docker, which we don’t want&lt;br&gt;
• PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE means Python will not try to write .pyc files which we&lt;br&gt;
also do not desire&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we use WORKDIR to set a default work directory path within our image called code&lt;br&gt;
which is where we will store our code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our dependencies we are using Pipenv so we copy over both the Pipfile and&lt;br&gt;
Pipfile.lock files into a /code/ directory in Docker and so on.....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note:&lt;br&gt;
Our image instructions are now done so let’s build the image using the command&lt;br&gt;
docker build . The period, . , indicates the current directory is where to execute the command.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Commad line

$ docker build .

...............................................
Sending build context to Docker daemon
154.1kB
Step 1/7 : FROM python:3.7
...
Step 7/7 : COPY . /code/
---&amp;gt; a48b2acb1fcc
Successfully built a48b2acb1fcc


&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving on we now need to create a docker-compose.yml file to control how to run the&lt;br&gt;
container that will be built based upon our Dockerfile image.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;version: '3.7'

services: 
    web:
        build: .
        command: python /code/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
        volumes: 
            - .:/code
        ports: 
            - 8000:8000
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The final step is to run our Docker container using the command docker-compose up .&lt;br&gt;
This command will result in another long stream of output code on the command line.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ docker-compose up

........................................................
Creating network "hello_default" with the default driver

Step 1/7 : FROM python:3.7
...

Attaching to hello_web_1
web_1 | Performing system checks...
web_1 |
web_1 | System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
web_1 | September 20, 2019 - 17:21:57
web_1 | Django version 2.2.5, using settings 'hello_project.settings'
web_1 | Starting development server at http://0.0.0.0:8000/
web_1 | Quit the server with CONTROL-C.

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To confirm it actually worked, go back to &lt;a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/"&gt;http://127.0.0.1:8000/&lt;/a&gt; in your web browser.&lt;br&gt;
Refresh the page and the “Hello, World” page should still appear. because this application are running locally your's system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop the container with Control+c (press the “Control” and “c” button at the same&lt;br&gt;
time) and additionally type &lt;code&gt;docker-compose down&lt;/code&gt; . Docker containers take up a lot of&lt;br&gt;
memory so it’s a good idea to stop them in this way when you’re done using them.&lt;br&gt;
Containers are meant to be stateless which is why we use volumes to copy our code&lt;br&gt;
over locally where it can be saved.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ docker-compose down

.............................
Removing hello_web_1 ... done
Removing network hello_default

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Great Developer's we are create Django application custom image and now we can upload this project image on &lt;a href="https://hub.docker.com/"&gt;Docker Hub &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and fetch it and worked without any  package installation error own your system locally.&lt;br&gt;
Thank You!!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ফেসবুকে ৫ পর্বে এই সিরিজ প্রথমে লেখি এবং বেশ ভালো সাড়া পাই। অনেকের অনুরোধে সব গুলো পর্বকে একত্রে এখানে সাজানো হল। আশাকরি পাঠকদের সুবিধা হবে।&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;সফটওয়্যার ইঞ্জিনিয়ারদের ইন্টারভিউ গাইড। বিশেষ করে যারা দেশের বাহিরে ইন্টারভিউ দিতে ইচ্ছুক তাদের জন্য এই গাইড লাইন উপকারে আসবে।&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#%E0%A6%AD%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B2%E0%A7%8B-%E0%A6%B8%E0%A6%AB%E0%A6%9F%E0%A6%93%E0%A6%AF%E0%A6%BC%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%AF%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%87%E0%A6%9E%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%9C%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%AF%E0%A6%BC%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%AD%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%AC%E0%A7%87-%E0%A6%B9%E0%A6%AC%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%A8-%E0%A6%AD%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B2%E0%A7%8B-%E0%A6%AC%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%A4%E0%A6%A8%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%9A%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%BF-%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%AD%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%AC%E0%A7%87-%E0%A6%AA%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%AC%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%A8"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ভালো সফটওয়্যার ইঞ্জিনিয়ার কিভাবে হবেন/ ভালো বেতনের চাকরি কিভাবে পাবেন?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#%E0%A6%AA%E0%A6%B0%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%AC%E0%A7%A7"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  পর্ব-১
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;প্রতিদিন &lt;strong&gt;LeetCode&lt;/strong&gt; /.... এ যান। কিছু পারেন না। ওকে, সবচেয়ে সোজা সোজা প্রবলেম খুঁজে বের করেন। যা পারেন, তাই &lt;strong&gt;code&lt;/strong&gt; করে &lt;strong&gt;submit&lt;/strong&gt; করেন। যদি &lt;strong&gt;accepted&lt;/strong&gt; হয় আলহামদুলিল্লাহ। না হইলে, আরো দুই তিন বার চেষ্টা করেন। ওকে, এবার ক্ষান্ত দেন। &lt;strong&gt;accepted&lt;/strong&gt; হোক বা না হোক, &lt;strong&gt;discussion board&lt;/strong&gt; এ চলে যান। সবার আলোচনা গুলো পড়েন। এই ধৈর্য আপনাকে শিখতে সবচেয়ে বেশি সাহায্য করবে।&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;আর &lt;strong&gt;code accepted&lt;/strong&gt; হলে, অন্যদের কোড দেখতে দেয়, খুঁটিয়ে খুঁটিয়ে সেগুলো পড়েন। ৯-১০ জনের কোড পড়েন। কেন এভাবে করলো একটু ভাবেন। &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;এভাবে যতদিন অতিবাহিত হবে, তত অতিমানবীয় সমস্যা আপনি সমাধান করতে পারবেন, ইনশাআল্লাহ।&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#%E0%A6%AA%E0%A6%B0%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%AC%E0%A7%A8"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  পর্ব-২
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;হাঁ,  আপনি এখন সহজ ও মোটামুটি মানের প্রব্লেম অনায়াসে সমাধান করতে পারেন। তার মানে, আপনি এখন যে কোন ভালো সফটওয়্যার কোম্পানির ১ম ও ২য় রাউন্ড টেকনিক্যাল ইন্টারভিউ এর জন্য প্রস্তুত। &lt;br&gt;
সমস্যা একটা আছে! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ইন্টারভিউ গুলোতে আপনি কত দ্রুত সমাধান করলেন সেটার চেয়ে বেশি গুরুত্বপূর্ণ আপনি কিভাবে প্রবলেমটা নিয়ে ডিল করলেন, কিভাবে ইন্টারভিউয়ারকে আপনার বুঝ-বুঝালেন, কিভাবে কর্নার কেস গুলো চিন্তা করলেন, এগুলো? &lt;br&gt;
শুধু LeetCode এ সমাধান করে গেলে, আপনি নির্ঘাত এই খানে ধরা খাবেন। &lt;br&gt;
প্রল্বলেম কমন পরলে, গুট গুট করে টাইপ করে সল্ভ করে ফেলবেন। আর কমন না পরলে, চুপ করে বসে বসে চিন্তা করতে থাকবেন। এই দুটাই ভুল উপায়। রয়ে সয়ে আস্তে আস্তে প্রব্লেমে ঢুকতে হবে। &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;তাহলে কিভাবে এগোবেন? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;১ম ও ২য় রাউন্ড টেকনিক্যাল ইন্টারভিউতে ভালো কারার জন্য, ভিডিও লেকচার নিয়মিত শোনা জরুরি। তাহলে বোঝা যায়, কিভাবে ইন্টারভিউয়ারের সাথে আলোচনা করতে করতে প্রব্লেম সল্ভ করার চেষ্টা করবেন। &lt;br&gt;
এজন্য ফ্রি ও পেইড অনেক সাইট আছে। ফ্রি &lt;strong&gt;youtube&lt;/strong&gt; চ্যালেন গুলার ভিতরে বেশ ভালো ও গোছানো &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmJz2DV1a3yfgrR7GqRtUUA"&gt;Back to Back SWE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... আরও অনেক অনেক আছে! &lt;br&gt;
আমি লিস্টের প্রথমটাকেই ফলো করতে বলবো। শুরুতে অনেক কিছু ফলো করলে, আসলে কোনটাই ফলো করা হয়ে উঠে না শেষ পর্যন্ত 😛  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;মনোযোগ দিয়ে ভিডিওর বুঝানোর ধরণ দেখে নিন। নিজের একটা ধরণ তৈরি করে ফেলেন। ইন্টারভিউয়ের সময় সে অনুযায়ী এগোতে পারলে, আপনি সফল হবেন ইনশাআল্লাহ। &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#%E0%A6%AA%E0%A6%B0%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%AC%E0%A7%A9"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  পর্ব-৩
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;২ টা টেকনিক্যাল ইন্টারভিউয়ের পর, ৩ নম্বরে আর একটা টেকনিক্যাল  ইন্টারভিউ হয় সাধারণত। যত সিনিয়র হবেন, এই লেভেল সাধারণত তত বেশি কঠিন হবে। &lt;br&gt;
এই জীবনে সফটওয়্যার বানাতে যত কাজ তথা পাপ কাজ করছেন, কেন করছেন, কিভাবে করছেন এই গল্প দিয়ে সাধারণত শুরু হবে এই ইন্টারভিউ। তো নিজের কাজ গুলো নিয়ে আগে থেকে গল্প বানায়ে রাখলে বলতে ও বুঝাতে সুবিধা হয়। গল্প গুলাতে যাতে কোন অসংলগ্নতা না থাকে তা মাথায় রাখবেন। &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;গল্প চলতে চলতে, আপনি সিস্টেম ডিজাইন ইন্টারভিউতে ঢুকে যাবেন। এই ইন্টারভিউ সত্যি খুব কঠিন। প্রতিটি উত্তরের ফাঁকে ফাঁকে আপনার জন্য নতুন প্রশ্ন অপেক্ষা করবে। &lt;br&gt;
সিস্টেম ডিজাইন ইন্টারভিউ কিভাবে ভাল করবেন? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;আপনার experience যত কম, এই ইন্টারভিউ আপনার জন্য তত সোজা। আপনি ফ্রেশার হলে, ১০০০ ফিট উঁচা দিয়ে সিস্টেম ডিজাইন করলেও পার পেয়ে যাবেন।&lt;br&gt;
আপনার experience যত বেশি, তত গভীরে ঢুকে সিস্টেম বর্ণনা করতে হবে। আর এ জন্য আপনাকে অনেক অনেক পড়তে হবে 😛 । খাতা কলম নিয়ে বসতে হবে।(পারলে সিস্টেমটা বানানোর চেষ্টা করতে হবে)।  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;এখন পড়বেন কই থেকে? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;এর জন্য আসলে ধরা বাঁধা কোন বই নাই 🙁  (একদম নাই এটা ঠিক না, অনেক অনেক জোস বই আছে, কিন্তু এই ইন্টারভিউ পার করতে ওগুলা না পড়াই ভালো 😛) । শুরু করার জন্য সবচেয়ে ভাল হচ্ছে &lt;a href="https://educative.io"&gt;educative&lt;/a&gt; এর &lt;a href="https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview"&gt;Grokking the System Design Interview&lt;/a&gt;। কিন্তু এটা পেইড 🙁 । এর একটা &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Ui2Bm_eyiF3-IUO2kA2qXIKFqMLPDHaN?fbclid=IwAR0GtxSk6YQl2aZlMPGb-M7C2mG2XawJNYVprwrUPrjTzAailqwqcbmXGN0"&gt;ফ্রি বিকল্প&lt;/a&gt; আছে। &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;আর এর সাথে সাথে, &lt;a href="http://highscalability.com/"&gt;highscalability&lt;/a&gt; সাইট থেকে দরকার মত যে কোন সিস্টেম নিয়ে আইডিয়া পাওয়া যাবে। &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;আর সিস্টেম ডিজাইনে জন্য বেশ ভালো লেগেছে &lt;strong&gt;Clement&lt;/strong&gt; এর &lt;strong&gt;system expart&lt;/strong&gt; এর ভিডিও গুলো। কেউ চাইলে শুনতে পারেন। &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;আর ফ্রি youtube ভিডিওর ভিতরে &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-vYrOAmtrx9sBzJAf3x_xw"&gt;Success in Tech&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/GISIGeometry"&gt;Hussein Nasser&lt;/a&gt; চ্যানেল ফলো করতে পারেন।    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;সবশেষে, সিস্টেম নিয়ে মাথার ভিতরে চিন্তা করতে হবে। খাতায় অনেক আঁকিবুঁকি করতে হবে, আবার চিন্তা করতে হবে। কেন &lt;strong&gt;nosql/sql&lt;/strong&gt; ব্যবহার করবেন অথবা করবেন না আপনার সিস্টেমে? কখন &lt;strong&gt;caching&lt;/strong&gt; করবেন / কখন &lt;strong&gt;distributed caching&lt;/strong&gt; করবেন? কখন/ কিভাবে &lt;strong&gt;database&lt;/strong&gt; এ পার্টিশন করবনে, কোন কলামের উপর &lt;strong&gt;indexing&lt;/strong&gt; করবেন। &lt;strong&gt;microservice&lt;/strong&gt; না &lt;strong&gt;monolithic architecture&lt;/strong&gt; এ পুরো সিস্টেম বানাবেন। redis কাজে লাগিয়ে কি করতে পারেন। &lt;strong&gt;Long pooling&lt;/strong&gt; দিয়ে &lt;strong&gt;notification system&lt;/strong&gt; বানানো খারাপ না ভালো... । আরও xyz অনেক কিছু। &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;এই ইন্টারভিউতে ঠিক বা ভুল কিছু নেই। মাথা ঠাণ্ডা রেখে আসতে আসতে মোটামুটি একটা সিস্টেমের গল্প বলে ইন্টারভিউয়ারকে খুশি করতে পারলেই ইনশাআল্লাহ্‌ পার পেয়ে যাবেন।&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#%E0%A6%AA%E0%A6%B0%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%AC%E0%A7%AA"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  পর্ব-৪
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#%E0%A6%87%E0%A6%A8%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%9F%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%AD%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%89-%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%B2-%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%AD%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%AC%E0%A7%87-%E0%A6%AE%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%AF%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%A8%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%9C-%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%AC%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%A8"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ইন্টারভিউ কল কিভাবে ম্যানেজ করবেন?
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;বিদ্যা অর্জনের কিছু নিয়ম আগের তিনটা পর্বে কিছুটা জানানোর চেষ্টা করছি। কিন্তু এত যে পড়লেন, যদি ইন্টারভিউতেই ডাক না পান, তাহলে লাভ তো হল না। &lt;br&gt;
কিভাবে ডাক পেতে পারেন? এটা নিয়ে একটু কথা বলার চেষ্টা করব। পুরোটাই নিজের মতামত + অন্যদের অভিজ্ঞতার আলোকে। &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;রিজার্ভ উপায় (&lt;/strong&gt; X কোম্পানিতে যদি পরিচিত Y চাকুরী করে, Y কে অনুরোধ করতে পারেন, আপনার সিভিটা রেফার করতে। এখানে মনে রাখতে হবে, আপনার নিজের উপর যদি আস্থা না থাকে, মানে আপনার প্রস্তুতি অত ভাল হয় নাই এখনও, তাহলে এমন অনুরোধ করা উচিত হবে না। &lt;strong&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LinkedIn এ বিভিন্ন নামকরা কোম্পানির রিক্রুটাররা থাকেন। তাদের ফলো করতে পারেন, তাদের পোষ্টে লাইক দিয়ে সব সময় তাদের পাশে থাকেতে পারেন 😛 । এভাবে আপনাদের দুজনের ভিতরে একটা অদৃশ্য বন্ধন তৈরি হবে। দেখবেন এই বন্ধনে, উনি আপনার প্রোফাইল ভিজিট করে ফেলবে একদিন। আর যদি প্রোফাইল পছন্দ হয়ে যায়, তাহলে তো ইন্টারভিউয়ের ডাক নিশ্চিত 😃 । &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;এর বাহিরে কিছু রিক্রুটাং সংস্থা ও ফ্রিল্যান্স  রিক্রুটার আছেন। তাদের ওখানে অনেক রিক্রুটার কাজ করেন। তাদের সাথেও উপরের উপায়ে  একটা সম্পর্ক তৈরি করে, আপনার সাথে অদৃশ্য বন্ধন সৃষ্টি করে ফেলতে পারেন। তারাও তাদের প্রয়োজন মত আপনাকে নক দিতে পারে। &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;আপনি নিজে চাইলে সরাসরি রিক্রুটারদের নক দিতে পারেন। এটাও একটা ভালো উপায়। কিন্তু তাই বলে গণ নক দিয়েন না। অনেক বুঝে শুনে, তাদের  job description আপনার সাথে যদি মিলে যায় তবেই নক দিয়েন। &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;এগুলোর বাহিরে LinkedIn এ বিভিন্ন জব পোষ্টে অ্যাপ্লাই করতে পারেন। ইচ্ছা মতন সব জবে অ্যাপ্লাই করতে যাবেন না। যেটা আপনার সাথে যায়, তাতেই বুঝে শুনে অ্যাপ্লাই করবেন।
LinkedIn এ জব নোটিফিকেশন অন করে রাখতে পারেন। ওপেন টু ওয়ার্ক ব্যানার ব্যবহার করতে পারেন। এতে রিক্রুটারদের আপনার উপর নজর পড়ার সম্ভাবনা বাড়বে।
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;সময় পেলে ভালো কনটেন্ট LinkedIn এ পোষ্ট করতে পারেন, এতে আপনার নক পাবার সম্ভাবনা কিছুটা বাড়বে। আপনার পরিচিতি বাড়বে। &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;এর বাহিরে &lt;strong&gt;Stackoverflow, Seek, EastNetic, Taylor Hall Recruitment, SPOTYOURJOB&lt;/strong&gt; এমন সাইটেও অনেক অনেক জব পোষ্ট পাবেন।  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;সিভিটা &lt;strong&gt;job description&lt;/strong&gt; এর সাথে একটু এলাইন করে, এরপর অ্যাপ্লাই করবেন। তা না হলে, ডাক না পাবার সম্ভাবনা শতভাগ।   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;উপরের উপায় অবলম্বন করে &lt;strong&gt;LinkedIn Premium&lt;/strong&gt; ব্যবহার না করেও আপনি অনেক অনেক আপ্লাই না করেও, বেশ কিছু ইন্টারভিউ কল পাবেন ইনশাআল্লাহ্‌।&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#%E0%A6%AA%E0%A6%B0%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%AC%E0%A7%AB"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  পর্ব-৫
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#%E0%A6%87%E0%A6%A8%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%9F%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%AD%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%89-%E0%A6%8F%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%AD%E0%A7%9F-%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%AD%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%AC%E0%A7%87-%E0%A6%A6%E0%A7%82%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%AC%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%A8"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ইন্টারভিউ এর ভয় কিভাবে দূর করবেন?
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;আপনি ভালো ভাবে প্রস্তুতি শেষ করলেন, জবে আপ্লাই করলেন। এখন ডাকও পেলেন। সমস্যা হল, কঠিন প্রস্তুতি শর্তেও, বেশির ভাগ ক্ষেত্রে প্রথমদিকে ইন্টারভিউ শুরু হবার পরে আপনাকে বোবায় ধরবে। &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;তাহলে বোবায় ধরা থেকে বাঁচবেন কিভাবে? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;উত্তর হচ্ছে, মূল/টার্গেটেড কোম্পানিতে বসার আগে সেকেন্ডারি কিছু ইন্টারভিউতে বসা। &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://pramp.com"&gt;pramp&lt;/a&gt; /... এর মতন সাইটে আপনি সহজেই আপনার ইন্টারভিউ পার্টনার পেতে পারেন। এমন সাইট গুলোতে কিছু ইন্টারভিউ দিলে আপনার কনফিডেন্স অনেক বেড়ে যাবে। &lt;br&gt;
এর বাহিরে যদি ২/৩ জন  ইন্টারভিউ পার্টনার জোগাড় কারা যায় তাহলে খুবই ভালো হয়। নিজেরা নিজেরা চিল করতে করতে অনেক গুলো ড্যামি ইন্টারভিউ দেয়ার সুযোগ হয়ে যাবে। সেই সাথে &lt;strong&gt;peer pressure&lt;/strong&gt; বলে একটা বিষয় আছে, সেটা প্রস্তুতির গতি বাড়িয়ে দেয়। &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;অনেকে শুধু খুব বড় বড় কোম্পানি গুলোতেই সিভি ফেলে, আসলে এর বাহিরে অনেক অনেক কোম্পানি আছে মধ্যম সারির যারা বেশ ভালো সুযোগ সুবিধা দেয়ে, ভিসাও স্পন্সর করে। এর বাহিরে প্রচুর স্টার্ট আপ তো আছেই, তারাও ভালো সুবিধা দেয়।&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
সুতরাং, এই সুযোগ গুলোকে কাজে লাগানো উচিত। এগুলোর ইন্টারভিউ প্রসেস তুলনামূলক সোজা, ফলে ভয় কম কাজ করে, সাথে ৪-৫ টা জায়গা থেকে ইন্টারভিউ কল পেলে সাহস অনেক বেড়ে যায়। যদি ভালো ইন্টারভিউ হয় আর অফার ব্যাটে-বলে মিলে যায় তাহলে তো জয়েন করেই ফেলেন আর যদি ব্যাটে-বলে নাও মিলে তবুও তো একটা ইন্টারভিউ দেয়ার বাস্তব অভিজ্ঞতা হয়ে গেল। যা,  মূল/টার্গেটেড কোম্পানির ইন্টারভিউতে সফল হতে অনেক অনেক সাহায্য করবে।      &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;বোনাস&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahmud-alnoor-tareq"&gt;তারেকের&lt;/a&gt; গাইড&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;মনে মনে ভেবে নেওয়া যে, চাকরিটা আসলে হয়ে গেছে, আর ইন্টারভিউয়াররা কলিগ। তারা যে প্রশ্নগুলো করছে, সেগুলো সত্যিকারেরই সমস্যা, যা তারা ফেইস করছে, এবং তাদের সাহায্য দরকার সলিউশনের জন্য। একটা গ্রুপ ডিসকাশনের মতো করে তাদেরকে বুঝিয়ে বলার এপ্রোচ নেওয়া।&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;এই মাইন্ডসেটে শুরুতে ঢুকা একটু কঠিন, কিন্তু একবার ঢুকে যেতে পারলে ইন্টারভিউয়ের অভিজ্ঞতা হয় চমৎকার। আর ইন্টারভিউয়াররাও এরকম কমিউনিকেটিভ প্রার্থী পেলে মুগ্ধ হওয়ার সম্ভাবনাও থাকে অনেক বেশি।&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;উপরের টেকনিক গুলো ফলো করলে, ইনশাআল্লাহ্‌ ইন্টারভিউ এর ভয় অনেকাংশে দূর হয়ে যাবে।&lt;/p&gt;
