      <title>CURD operations, NodeJs, JWT</title>
      <author>Md Shah Jalal </author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Dec 2021 09:51:33 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/programmershahjalal/curd-operations-nodejs-jwt-pel</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/programmershahjalal/curd-operations-nodejs-jwt-pel</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-the-curd-operations"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is the CURD operations?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we create a project with React as a client site and with NodeJs as a server site, we have to process some operations on the server site with NodeJs. CURD is an acronym that stands for Create, Update, Read, and Delete. According to our needs, We use to get, post, put, delete methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-nodejs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is NodeJs?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NodeJs is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js runs single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronous programming, which is very memory efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-can-nodejs-do"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What can NodeJs do:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Node.js can generate the dynamic page content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Node.js can create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Node.js can collect form data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Node.js can add, delete, modify data in your database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-jwt"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is JWT?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most web apps use security measures to make sure user data stays private. Authentication is a key part of security and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a great way to implement authentication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#so-what-are-json-web-tokens"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  So what are JSON Web Tokens?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JWT is a standard that defines a compact and self-contained way to securely transmit information between a client and a server as a JSON object. The compact size makes the tokens easy to transfer through an URL, POST parameter, or inside an HTTP header. Also, since they are self-contained they include all the necessary information about a user so the database does not need to be queried more than once.&lt;br&gt;
The information in a JWT can be trusted because it is digitally signed using a secret or public/private key pair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#authentication"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Authentication
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JWT is mainly used for authentication. After a user logs in to an application, the application will create a JWT and send it back to the user. Subsequent requests by the user will include the JWT. The token tells the server what routes, services, and resources the user is allowed to access. JWT can be easily used across multiple domains so they are often used for Single Sign-On.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#install"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Install
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install react-jwt&lt;br&gt;
or&lt;br&gt;
yarn add react-jwt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#usage"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Usage
&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import React from "react";
import { useJwt } from "react-jwt";
const token = "Your JWT";

const Example = () =&amp;gt; {
  const { decodedToken, isExpired } = useJwt(token);
  /*
    If is a valid jwt, 'decodedToken' will be a object
    it could look like:
    {
      "name": "Gustavo",
      "iat": 1596408259,
      "exp": 4752168259
    }

    'isExpired' will return a boolean
    true =&amp;gt; your token is expired
    false =&amp;gt; your token is not expired
  */

  return (
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
      ...
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
  );
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can also use the methods isExpired(token) and decodeToken(token)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import React from "react";
import { isExpired, decodeToken } from "react-jwt";
const token = "Your JWT";

const Example = () =&amp;gt; {
  const myDecodedToken = decodeToken(token);
  const isMyTokenExpired = isExpired(token);

  return (
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
      ...
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
  );
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#refresh-state"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Refresh state
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use the refreshToken(newToken) method, useJwt's state will be updated&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import React from "react";
import { useJwt } from "react-jwt";
const token = "Your JWT";

const Example = () =&amp;gt; {
  const { decodedToken, isExpired, reEvaluateToken } = useJwt(token);

  const updateToken = () =&amp;gt; {
    const newToken = "A new JWT";
    reEvaluateToken(newToken); // decodedToken and isExpired will be updated
  }

  return (
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
      ...
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
  );
};

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>My first post</title>
      <author>Fabio Costa</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Dec 2021 09:26:31 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/fabiocosta89/my-first-post-4629</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/fabiocosta89/my-first-post-4629</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, my name is Fábio and I am a &lt;a href="https://fabiocosta.eu/#about"&gt;Web developer&lt;/a&gt;, specialized in .NET. Although I have a developer degree, I always considered myself a web developer, since I started my career doing web development and I love it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxembourg"&gt;Luxembourg&lt;/a&gt; for almost 8 years now, and I like it. It's a very international (small) country, where you can find several different cultures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xDqAbUpJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rzesr83qpkv8c14vpy71.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xDqAbUpJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rzesr83qpkv8c14vpy71.jpg" alt="Luxembourg flag" width="800" height="319"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the question, why did I create a blog? I could have just created my website, with just my information and done, right?..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I could do that and then go to &lt;a href="https://medium.com/"&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://dev.to/"&gt;Dev&lt;/a&gt; and read some post from some other developer. The world is full of content consumers and there aren't many creators. Most people spend their free time reading newspapers, on Facebook, Instagram, blogs, etc. I am one of those people also...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I decided I need to create content. Even if it's only for myself. About what? Wherever comes to my mind at the time. About thoughts, tech, coding, .NET, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Avpt4hk8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tr4m3lebyvhmii3ed0z4.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Avpt4hk8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tr4m3lebyvhmii3ed0z4.jpg" alt="Une person at the top of a rock" width="800" height="1067"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here is my first post, with a small introduction and a promise (that I will give my best, not to fail), with my quest of producing content, relevant and interesting preferentially, and contributing to the world's content. I will share my knowledge and learn a lot with this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accept yourself the challenge. Produce some content for others. Contribute with your knowledge. It will be hard, but you will learn in the process and feel good in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This was first published on my website &lt;a href="https://fabiocosta.eu/blog/my-first-post"&gt;fabiocosta.eu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Which language is used for iOS app development?</title>
      <author>Jhonth Smith</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Dec 2021 08:33:57 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/jhonthsmith/which-language-is-used-for-ios-app-development-5fih</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/jhonthsmith/which-language-is-used-for-ios-app-development-5fih</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Swift programming language used for &lt;a href="https://www.franticpro.com/ios-app-development/"&gt;Ios app development&lt;/a&gt;, swift programming language  is very powerful and easy to learn. Swift also powerful programming language for IOS, Ipad OS, MacOS, tvOS and watch OS. Swift code is safe by UI design productive software that is running in smoothly and fast.  Swift is the result of the latest research on the programming language.&lt;br&gt;
In this article, I'll clarify precisely what programming language choices you have for coding iOS applications. We'll check out the promising and less promising times of programming in those dialects, and assets for learning them.&lt;br&gt;
At long last, we'll cover methodologies you can use to soar your learning speed and get your application to showcase in record time.&lt;br&gt;
Contemplate your application costs. On the whole, we want to think about an essential inquiry. The "best" &lt;a href="https://www.franticpro.com/ios-app-development/"&gt;iOS programming language&lt;/a&gt; to learn relies completely upon the objectives you've gone ahead for your application.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Modern:&lt;/strong&gt; Swift is the consequence of the most recent exploration on programming dialects, joined with many years of involvement building Apple stages. Named boundaries are communicated in a perfect linguistic structure that makes APIs in Swift much simpler to peruse and keep up with. Stunningly better, you don't have to type semi-colons. Surmised types make code cleaner and less inclined to botches, while modules kill headers and give namespaces. To best help worldwide dialects and emoticon, Strings are Unicode-right and utilize an UTF-8 based encoding to enhance execution for a wide-assortment of utilization cases. Memory is overseen consequently utilizing tight, deterministic reference counting, downplaying memory utilization without the overhead of trash assortment.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;UI Designing Safely:&lt;/strong&gt; Swift takes out whole classes of perilous code. Factors are constantly introduced before use, exhibits and numbers are checked for flood, memory is consequently made due, and requirement of select admittance to memory prepares for some programming botches. Punctuation is tuned to make it simple to characterize your aim — for instance, straightforward three-character watchwords characterize a variable ( var ) or consistent ( let ). Also Swift vigorously use esteem types, particularly for generally utilized sorts like Arrays and Dictionaries. This implies that when you make a duplicate of something with that kind, you realize it will not be changed somewhere else.&lt;br&gt;
Another wellbeing highlight is that naturally Swift items can never be anything. Indeed, the Swift compiler will prevent you from attempting to make or utilize a nothing object with an aggregate time mistake. This makes composing code a lot of cleaner and more secure, and forestalls an immense classification of runtime crashes in your applications. In any case, there are situations where nothing is legitimate and proper. For these circumstances Swift has a creative element known as optional. A discretionary may contain nothing, however Swift sentence structure constrains you to securely manage it utilizing the? Grammar to show to the compiler you comprehend the conduct and will deal with it securely.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Basic Concepts every Node.js developer must know</title>
      <author>DhiWise</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Dec 2021 08:30:41 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/dhiwise/basic-concepts-every-nodejs-developer-must-know-4l5</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RthX5g_N--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0%2AVgJr7GuYaWNNZwN1" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RthX5g_N--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0%2AVgJr7GuYaWNNZwN1" alt="" width="624" height="353"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes the JavaScript community happy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sure answer is a Node.js technology that shines in the world of real-time web application development. The technology is created in 2009 by Ryan Dahl to solve many issues related to app performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth choosing node.js as the next technology to learn as it allows you to use JavaScript both at the server and client-side. In this article, we are going to explore technology and its basic concepts every node.js beginner must know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, before that check this out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#major-insights-of-nodejs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Major insights of Node.js
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big organizations such as &lt;strong&gt;PayPal, eBay, Netflix, Reddit, LinkedIn, and Tumbler use Node.js.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than **50% of the developers use Node.js **in their projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Stack Overflow developers survey, it is among the top 10 most popular technologies used by developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It helps to reduce development costs by 58% and increase application performance by 50%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;85% of the users use it primarily for web app development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serverless friendly technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find more information about &lt;a href="https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/nodejs-foundation-survey/"&gt;Node.js insights here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-nodejs-and-why-do-we-need-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Node.js and why do we need it?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Node.js is an asynchronous event-driven javascript runtime built on the V8 JavaScript engine, designed to build scalable network applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript is the only language Node.js supports natively but many languages can be directly compiled to JS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do we need Node.js?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Node.js eliminates the limitations of the multithread approach with its single-threaded characteristic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike PHP where most functions are blocked until their completion, Node.js functions are nonblocking which means commands are executed concurrently or even in parallel without blocking other commands using callbacks and other advanced mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are build-in modules and multiple libraries built by the developer community that simplifies and speeds up the app development process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#basic-concept-in-nodejs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Basic Concept in Node.js
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a beginner then you must have a good understanding of following Node.js concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Node.js as an event-driven technology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Node.js makes extensive use of events that means the control flow of the server-side platform is driven by occurrences of events. When the application starts, it initializes the variables and functions, and then the event listener calls the Event loop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Event loop is nothing but a single thread that receives incoming requests. These requests are checked and executed if they are nonblocking and the blocking request is allocated to the background thread in the worker’s pool. Meanwhile, the event loop waits until the background thread completes its operation and gives the result back to the event loop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are mainly two-component of event-driven programming:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Event handlers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Event Loop&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Node.js applications run on the single thread&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScrip is the single-threaded programming language and thus the Node.js applications are single-threaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Node.js app can deal with multiple events at a time using a single thread(Event loop). However, when you look into its &lt;a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/node-js-web-application-architecture/"&gt;architecture&lt;/a&gt; you will find that there are background threads (worker threads) running in the background that carry out CPU-intensive tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above arrangement allows Node.js to perform non-blocking operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Note: Worker treads were introduced in the Node.js version 11.7.0 and above, if you are using the prior version, enable it using — experimental-worker flag when invoking Node.js)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. NPM- A package manager for Node.js&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NPM (Node package manager) is the world’s largest open-source library. Using the NPM package manager you can install the packages you want to build the app faster. Also, you can install custom modules(independent node.js components) using NPM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this short article, we have learned about Node.js, why we need it, and its basic concepts. Now, you have a basic understanding of how Node.js works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technology is used by many companies and startups because of its ultra-modern features. If you started using Node.js, try &lt;a href="https://hubs.la/H0_-wmC0"&gt;DhiWise&lt;/a&gt;- A revolutionary platform to build scalable web and mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The platform supports popular technologies including Node.js and MongoDB. So, what are you waiting for &lt;a href="https://app.dhiwise.com/signin"&gt;sign up&lt;/a&gt; today!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Java/ Convert PPS/PPT to PPTX</title>
      <author>carlwils</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Dec 2021 07:41:51 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/carlwils/java-convert-ppsppt-to-pptx-3kd2</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/carlwils/java-convert-ppsppt-to-pptx-3kd2</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;PPS is a PowerPoint Show format that opens in full-screen slideshow mode and automatically exits when finishing displaying . While PPT is the default file extension for saving presentations in PowerPoint 2003 and earlier versions. Sometimes, you may receive a PowerPoint presentation in .pps or .ppt format. In this article, you will learn how to programmatically convert them to PPTX format using Free Spire.Presentation for Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#import-jar-dependency"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Import jar dependency
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;● You can download the &lt;a href="https://www.e-iceblue.com/Download/presentation-for-java-free.html"&gt;free library&lt;/a&gt; and unzip it, and then add the Spire.Presentation.jar file to your project as dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;● Or you can directly add the jar dependency to your maven project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight xml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;repositories&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;repository&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;id&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;com.e-iceblue&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/id&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;e-iceblue&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/name&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;url&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;http://repo.e-iceblue.com/nexus/content/groups/public/&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/url&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/repository&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/repositories&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;dependencies&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;e-iceblue&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;spire.presentation.free&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;3.9.0&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/dependencies&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;【The &lt;strong&gt;Presentation.saveToFile()&lt;/strong&gt; method offered by Free Spire.Presentation for Java allows you to convert the pps and ppt file fromat to pptx with just a few lines of code.】&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Load PowerPoint  file&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;ppt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;loadFromFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"sample.pps"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Save the PPS document to PPTX file format&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;ppt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;saveToFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"output/convertPPSToPPTX.pptx"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;FileFormat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;PPTX_2013&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

  &lt;a href="#hello"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Hello 👋
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to CSS Animation Article. In this, we're going to see how to create an Amazing Notification Alert Animation in Pure CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Notifications&lt;/strong&gt; are very important in today's life. It reminds you the things that you forgot, It shows you the progress of various things so that you don't have to open that specific application again and again. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hence to show that user recieves a new notification is not a simple task. Here's an easy animation which you can use in your application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let's get started....&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Before going to coding section, checkout quick preview first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#heres-preview"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Here's Preview:-
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--djG9xKzr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5hld9u946myky1lizkg3.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--djG9xKzr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5hld9u946myky1lizkg3.gif" alt="Imagen" width="800" height="450"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-1"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 1
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like always, create 2 files - Index.html and Style.css.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-2"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 2
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After creating the html file add the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; tag with bell icon that wrap into &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#html"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  HTML
&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;html&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;lang=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"en"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;charset=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"UTF-8"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Amazing Notification Alert&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;rel=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'stylesheet'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.8.1/css/all.min.css'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;rel=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"stylesheet"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"./style.css"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"bell"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"bell-border"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"fas fa-bell btn-bell"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-3"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 3
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then add the Style.css for amazing style. Using this file we can manage the style as per requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#css"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  CSS
&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;overflow-x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;hidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#f6f7fc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.bell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.bell-border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.btn-bell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;absolute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;translate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;-50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;-50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.bell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;60px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; 

    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;60px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;box-shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;-1px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#999&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#7844E8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;animation-name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;col&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;animation-duration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;animation-iteration-count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;infinite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.bell-border&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;59px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;animation-name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bord-pop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;@keyframes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bord-pop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="err"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;translate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;-50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;-50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="err"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="err"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="err"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;scale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1.1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;translate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="err"&gt;75&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;scale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;translate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="err"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;scale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;translate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;@keyframes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bell-ring&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="err"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;translate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;-50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;-50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="err"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;translate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;-50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;-50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rotate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;25deg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="err"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;translate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;-50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;-50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rotate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;-25deg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="err"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;translate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;-50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;-50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rotate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0deg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="err"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;translate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;-50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;-50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rotate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0deg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-4"&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#table-of-contents"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Table Of Contents
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#structure"&gt;HTML Structure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#tags"&gt;Elements / Tags&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="#manatory"&gt;Mandatory Elements / Tags&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#attributes"&gt;Attributes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#structure"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Structure &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the English language or any other language, there are grammar rules on how to word out sentences. When it comes to programming languages, they also come with a set of rules that we have to follow in order for the computer to understand what we want it to do. The Web Page or Web Object is a world of its own. We can access the Web Browser Object simply by going onto the web browser's console. There are many ways to communicate with the web browser, which is why HTML is not the only way to create web pages, but yet it is easy for the human brain to read and understand, which is why it is usually recommended for beginner developers to get a glimpse of developing web pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also helps us organize our content too. Another way to look at a web page is the newspaper. The front page can be the landing page describing the biggest news of the day; there can be articles in their little sections, too, where topics are divided into groups and are aligned altogether. HTML's structure helps achieve this on the web. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--J0oUEwB7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.flipsnack.com/template/3583/small/page_1" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--J0oUEwB7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.flipsnack.com/template/3583/small/page_1" alt="newspaper" width="300" height="424"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HyperText Markup Language&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;Hypertext&lt;/strong&gt; allows us to create links for users to access another web page quickly. &lt;strong&gt;MarkUp&lt;/strong&gt; allows us to annotate text and provide additional information. Tags or Elements (can be used interchangeably) allow us to define our structure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#elements-tags"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Elements / Tags &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example can be a Word Document, we can create headings, lists, forms, and paragraphs. In &lt;strong&gt;HTML&lt;/strong&gt; we do this with &lt;strong&gt;Elements&lt;/strong&gt;. When we want to add content or information on to the web, HTML has some built in &lt;strong&gt;elements&lt;/strong&gt; that allow us to display our content the way we want it to. When working with &lt;strong&gt;elements&lt;/strong&gt; there is a specific way we need to write out our tags in order for the web browser to understand. We can think of tags as our wrapper or container for our content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XA_mE7dh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/w6dnnke3mznr3txxte0c.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XA_mE7dh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/w6dnnke3mznr3txxte0c.jpg" alt="Tags Example" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We first would declare our &lt;strong&gt;opening tag&lt;/strong&gt; with a &lt;strong&gt;Left-Angle-Bracket&lt;/strong&gt; followed by our &lt;strong&gt;element&lt;/strong&gt;, followed by a &lt;strong&gt;Right-Angle-Bracket&lt;/strong&gt;. After our opening tag, we can add our content. Once we are done with our content, we end it with a &lt;strong&gt;closing tag&lt;/strong&gt;. Like before, we start with our &lt;strong&gt;Left-Angle-Bracket&lt;/strong&gt;, but to tell HTML we are done with this part, we add a &lt;strong&gt;Forward-Slash&lt;/strong&gt; next, followed by our &lt;strong&gt;element&lt;/strong&gt;, ending it with a &lt;strong&gt;Right-Angle-Bracket&lt;/strong&gt;. Now lets learn about what &lt;strong&gt;elements&lt;/strong&gt; are usually required for our HTML document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#mandatory-elements-tags"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Mandatory Elements / Tags &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we first create our HTML document, there are a few elements that we need to have written out first in order to get start adding our content.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HTML Element&lt;/strong&gt; : this element is our &lt;strong&gt;root&lt;/strong&gt; element. Everything we want to show on from our &lt;strong&gt;HTML&lt;/strong&gt; document has to be wrapped inside these &lt;strong&gt;tags&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Head Element&lt;/strong&gt; : this tag usually contains information about the document. It can hold other &lt;strong&gt;elements&lt;/strong&gt; inside of it, for example.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;title&amp;gt; Our title &amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title Element&lt;/strong&gt; : this tag defines the documents name and is shown on the Browsers Tab. This can only contain text and can not hold any other elements inside.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;
      Our title
    &amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next section would be our &lt;strong&gt;Sectioning root&lt;/strong&gt; or known as the &lt;strong&gt;Body&lt;/strong&gt; element. Where all of our HTML content will be wrapped in. There can only be &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; body element per HTML document.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here is a quick example of an HTML document with some content.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;
      Our title
    &amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt; Our Heading element &amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

    &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
    &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

    &amp;lt;h3&amp;gt; Sub heading &amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;

    &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; 
      Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderi
    &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;  

  &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#attributes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Attributes &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also add additional information onto our &lt;strong&gt;elements&lt;/strong&gt; using &lt;strong&gt;Attributes&lt;/strong&gt;. We add &lt;strong&gt;Attributes&lt;/strong&gt; to the &lt;strong&gt;opening&lt;/strong&gt;tag of our element. It consists of a &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;value.&lt;/code&gt; We assign the &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; given. There are some built-in &lt;strong&gt;Attribute&lt;/strong&gt; names available to us to use. We can give &lt;strong&gt;elements&lt;/strong&gt; names to help servers identify them easier when working with data.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello Devs, if you want to learn Data Science and Machine Learning with Python in 2022 and looking for best resources like books and online courses then you have come to the right place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier, I have shared best Python book for Data Science and today, I am going to share with you best Python courses for Data Science and Machine Learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know what Python is, right? If you don't, let me give you a brief overview. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language with enhanced readability. The syntax is also well-constructed and has an object-oriented approach. This will enable programmers to write clear and logical code for small and large projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data Science can be broadly defined as a field that extracts insights from structured and unstructured data using scientific methods and algorithms. These insights can then be applied across a wide range of domains and fields. It can be used for increasing sales, optimizing workflow, cash flow, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machine Learning can be defined as a branch of Artificial Intelligence, or AI, and is based on the idea that algorithms and systems can learn from data, identify patterns, and optimize processes. As you can see, Data Science and Machine Learning can be viewed as complementary to each other. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python has a number of libraries like &lt;a href="https://numpy.org/"&gt;Numpy&lt;/a&gt;, Matplotlib, and Pandas that are perfect for data science. Numpy is the basis for the Pandas library and also makes it easier to perform a lot of mathematical and statistical operations. Pandas, in turn, was created specifically to work with data and is perfect for data science work in Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matplotlib can be used to quickly visualize your data for gaining insights quickly by creating charts, graphs, etc. Then there is scikit-learn and Pandas which is the most popular library for machine learning work in Python.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Software development is a complex and dynamic field. There are an infinite number of things to know, and new advancements in technology happen every day. As a result, it's incredibly easy to get lost or overwhelmed with all the new information that comes at you on a daily basis. In order to stay competitive as a software developer, it's important to be productive - but what does that really mean? This article will explore how being more productive can have a huge impact on your career as a software developer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a developer, you must be productive in order to stay competitive. A good way to think about productivity is by considering the impact of your work on someone else - whether it's another employee, manager, or client. When you finish something at work (a program, documentation, test plan), does it make someone else's life easier? By always thinking of this person and how the outcome of your work impacts them, you can determine where to spend your time and energy when working on a task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What does it mean to be productive as a software developer?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being productive means that a software developer is completing tasks in a fast and efficient manner, while still maintaining a good quality of work (and not having any errors/defects in your work). Quality is always more important than speed - no one wants to work with a developer that does sloppy, inaccurate job after job. A developer who is productive will get things done quickly without sacrificing quality or accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ways to stay more productive in the workplace&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GxA4C3N6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.realpythonproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/pexels-photo-380769.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GxA4C3N6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.realpythonproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/pexels-photo-380769.jpeg" alt="man sitting in front of computer" width="880" height="494"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Photo by Marc Mueller on &lt;a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/man-sitting-in-front-of-computer-380769/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Pexels.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways you can stay focused and increase productivity at work today! Here are some of my favorite tips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List out tasks for each day ahead of time so you aren't spending too much time planning. If there aren't any deadlines, write down what your project goals are for next week so your brain isn't thinking about them all day long when they need to be completed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Structure your days by identifying which parts of the day require more focus, and which ones you can give a bit less attention to without sacrificing quality. For example, I keep a daily journal when working on a project in my free time to brainstorm ideas for the week. When it's time to sit down and work on that project, I know that this is when 100% of my focus is required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify your bad habits at work and find ways to eliminate them! This might be different depending on who you are as a person - maybe you eat junk food in the middle of the day or chat with coworkers too often in Slack. There's no one-size-fits-all solution for productivity, but everyone has things they could do better - make sure you're doing what works for you!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you find you aren't getting much done when taking breaks, limit them to 10 minutes every hour. This is long enough to give your brain a break but not too long that it's harder to refocus on what you were working on prior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why being more thoughtful and careful with your code matters for its longevity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons why it's important as a software developer to write reliable and high-quality code (including the fact that this ensures less time will need to be spent troubleshooting), but one of the top reasons is because your product/application will last longer if it has great quality and tests in place!   When there are no defects or errors in an application, there isn't anything that needs to be fixed or re-done. If you are confident that your application cannot fail, then you can be sure it will last for many more years without having to make changes to the codebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on my personal experience, below are some tips to improve your productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1 . Write more, delete less!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a developer, one of the main things you focus on is writing code - and there's nothing wrong with this! However, sometimes we get caught up in writing and forget to remove our old code when it's no longer needed. This kind of unnecessary bloat makes finding things later on much harder because now there is code everywhere and none of it is clearly documented. Delete what isn't necessary so future developers (or yourself!) won't have such a hard time navigating the project. Also, consider writing pseudo-code before you actually write any code. This reduces the chances of errors and unnecessary code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Write tests to ensure your code is reliable and repeatable&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a software developer, it's important for you to write tests whenever you make changes to the codebase - this both ensures that new features are working as intended, and also provides documentation about what was added/changed. When automated testing isn't done before any kind of "code review" takes place, there isn't anything preventing another developer from adding in more unnecessary bloat because they weren't aware of what was already present. Software should be written for humans first and then computers second!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Test-driven development (TDD) can improve your productivity by allowing you to write cleaner code&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Test-driven development become increasingly popular over the last few years, and there is a good reason for this! When you follow the TDD process, you write tests (to run automatically against your code) before writing any actual code. This means that when you are finished writing the test, your application will work exactly how it was intended to by creating all of the expected conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Make use of editors/IDEs to increase productivity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although not every developer has the same preferences when it comes to what kind of text editor or IDE they would like to use with their projects, some tools can make our lives much easier when writing code! Programmers who often switch between different languages may benefit from using an IDE over a plain text editor because IDEs typically have autocomplete features and advanced syntax highlighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Make use of syntax extensions to increase productivity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syntax extensions are plugins made for your text editor or IDE that can make writing code much easier! For example, some syntax extensions may support autocomplete features depending on what kind of language you are using (PHPStorm is a popular IDE with many available autocomplete extensions for PHP), while other IDE-specific extensions can automatically generate project files if you don't want to keep track yourself. Lots of software developers find that the more programmable their text editor is, the more productive they'll be!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;6. Keep up-to-date knowledge of programming languages and tools by regularly reading articles/blogs/stack overflow posts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a software developer, it's important for you to keep up-to-date knowledge of the programming languages and tools that you use in order to be more productive in your current and future jobs. If you don't like reading articles on a website, there are also many book titles that can provide useful information - such as "Python: The Right Way"  or "Clean Code". Additionally, blogs are full of great content if you are looking for something specific! Stack overflow has revolutionized how people get help with their development problems, so it's good practice for developers to check the site frequently - just remember not to post unfinished code unless absolutely necessary!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;7. Know your tools, but don't let them own you&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You learn how to work with a new programming language or framework every day, right? You're always stumbling upon something new that could make you more productive. The trick is learning how to work quickly without getting bogged down in the details of what you are doing. If you are using a technology for the first time, this can be hard since it requires you to take extra time setting up your environment and learning the language syntax. That said, if you already know these things about your required tools then it will be much faster next time around!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;8. Back-track and keep a note of how long it took you to complete that task&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, it's not your productivity but it is that you under-estimated the time required for a task to be complete. Everybody always thinks they can do tasks faster than they actually can. This may be because we play computer games, visit social media too often, or even just dream about how we would like our software to function. Whatever the reason is, it's important to figure out how long things actually take so that you can budget your time better. There are two ways to do this: either you note down how much time tasks take when you first start them, or - if you know already - backtrack and figure out how long it would have taken. Use timers to keep track of your progress&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes setting up a timer for every project seems like too much work, but there are other times where it really helps push you to get done faster. If you want to challenge yourself using timers, make sure to put something on the line (i.e. money). If nothing else works, then try giving yourself small goals like finishing one section within 5 minutes! Don't be sloppy. You can also use extensions like &lt;a href="https://wakatime.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;WakaTime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;9. Over-Document and Over-Communicate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you're in the zone, it can sometimes seem like you don't need to check for typos or mistakes. Some developers might even think that writing good comments is a waste of time and effort. However, making these small improvements can help prevent your colleagues from thinking: "Ugh I wish they would have commented their code better". You wouldn't want to read an article with &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;misspelling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; or poor grammar, so why write confusing code?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will help you to prevent having to go back to a previous task/feature just to explain the logic behind how it works&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have been working on a large feature, give smaller updates to your stakeholders. This will not only keep you motivated but also help you get timely feedback and avoid having to scrap everything and start fresh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;10 .Prioritize Tasks Appropriately&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes programmers forget about everything else happening around them when they are focusing on one specific task/project at hand. This means that they may not realize how much time they spent doing that one thing until it's too late. To avoid this issue, always keep track of what you're working on and prioritize tasks that are required for other developers to complete their tasks, i.e their tasks are dependent on your tasks. By finishing such tasks before, you'll be under lesser pressure and won't be nagged by anyone to get something done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;11. (Bonus) Have a break, Have a KitKat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--g_NULAgm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.realpythonproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/pexels-photo-6167329.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--g_NULAgm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.realpythonproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/pexels-photo-6167329.jpeg" alt="love dark bar broken" width="880" height="587"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Photo by Vie Studio on &lt;a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/love-dark-bar-broken-6167329/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Pexels.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe don't have KitKats that frequently but take a break every hour or so. It is easy to get caught up and spend hours just heads down coding. But no feature is worth sacrificing your health for. Take occasional breaks, trust me it'll do you good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you find this article helpful. Share your tips on how you stay productive and things you do to improve your productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
