      <title>Turtle Race game in Python using Turtle class!</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/bharadwaj6262/turtle-race-game-in-python-using-turtle-class-33me</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello all, Hope you all are doing well. After so many backspaces and spending entirely my two days of time, I have designed a turtle game in Python. Let's talk deeply about this in this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's exactly happening here. We have a total of 6 turtles, of different colors which move with a random length. First, we should bet on a turtle, by entering the color of it. The turtle which first crosses the line is declared as a winner. The entire code is done in Python by importing turtle and random libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire program is done by following the &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html?highlight=turt#module-turtle"&gt;&lt;em&gt;official Python documentation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code explanation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets import packages&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;from turtle import Turtle, Screen
import random

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The random function is used to generate the distance(randomly), to be traveled by turtles. It's better to give screen size because it will be easy for us to locate the coordinates and change accordingly.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;screen = Screen()
screen.setup(width=500, height=400)

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is a function called textinput(), which opens a dialogue box and asks for user input.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;user_bet = screen.textinput(title="Place your bet", prompt="Which turtle will win the race? Enter a color: ")

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, we should give our race turtles colors. So, that we can distinguish them. And also the coordinates where then should stand for the race.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;colors = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple"]
y_positions = [-100, -60, -20, 20, 60, 100]

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The exact coordinates of all the turtles are classified using a for loop by taking the above y-coordinates and colors into consideration.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;for turtle_index in range(0,6):
    new_turtle = Turtle(shape="turtle")
    new_turtle.color(colors[turtle_index])
    new_turtle.penup()
    new_turtle.goto(x=-230, y= y_positions[turtle_index])
    all_turtles.append(new_turtle)

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, the final thing we should do is to make our turtles move a random distance each time. And the turtle which reaches the other end of the screen at first is the turtle that has won the race. At the start, we place a bet on the turtle and if that turtle wins then we win and if it loses then we also lose.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;while is_race_on:
    for turtle in all_turtles:
        if turtle.xcor() &amp;gt; 230:
            is_race_on = False
            winning_color = turtle.pencolor()
            if winning_color == user_bet:
                print(f"You've won!, The {winning_color} turtle is the winner.")
            else:
                print(f"You've lost!, The {winning_color} turtle is the winner.")
        rand_distance = random.randint(0, 10)
        turtle.forward(rand_distance)

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The main advantage of setting the screen width and height is we can easily calculate the start and end coordinates by assuming the screen as a graph paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Images of the output&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A. Giving "red" as the user input. &lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_PTCppa7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1621442714631/sJqfcFEFg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_PTCppa7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1621442714631/sJqfcFEFg.png" alt="Screenshot (160).png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;B. Image of how the turtles move. &lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tLrphuiZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1621442762631/0JoG34Zu3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tLrphuiZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1621442762631/0JoG34Zu3.png" alt="Screenshot (161).png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;C. End of the race. Which says whether we won or lose the race. &lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Mr3iGi2P--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1621442802119/7GAFpX77w.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Mr3iGi2P--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1621442802119/7GAFpX77w.png" alt="Screenshot (162).png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>High Speed Data Monitoring for Modern Industrial Challenges</title>
      <author>Margo McCabe</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 16:55:04 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/margo_hdb/high-speed-data-monitoring-for-modern-industrial-challenges-4l4c</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/margo_hdb/high-speed-data-monitoring-for-modern-industrial-challenges-4l4c</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Organizations in the industrial space deal with similar challenges when it comes to data, and those challenges become more prominent the longer they go unanswered. Industry 4.0 is moving forward at full speed, meaning that traditional manufacturing and industrial processes continue to be automated with modern technology -- which is super exciting! This is done through methods like internet of things (IoT), smart machines, and advanced monitoring and analysis techniques. Now that we have all these mechanisms in place to capture data, questions arise such as what to do with that data, where to put it, what can we learn from it, and are we even capturing it in the most efficient manner possible in the first place? There is &lt;strong&gt;so much&lt;/strong&gt; data being generated every single nanosecond from endless sources globally, it’s kind of hard to wrap your head around! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#too-much-data-too-little-time"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Too Much Data, Too Little Time
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that a lot of industrial organizations still have legacy systems in place for the capture, processing, and analysis of that data, and they end up throwing more and more money at the problem without gaining real value or insights. When collected and utilized correctly, this data can provide unparalleled insights that can predict and prevent things like machine maintenance and downtime, loss of production, and system failure. In certain industries, the difference between &lt;em&gt;near&lt;/em&gt; real-time insights and &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; real-time insights could be hundreds of millions of dollars. Many technologies, both legacy and modern, become so overloaded with the sheer speed and volume of data being generated that they cannot process efficiently enough to provide actual real-time insights. Additionally, it’s important to be able to separate the noise from the anomalies in the massive amounts of data being generated so that teams both on the shop floor and at the central office can focus on what’s really important for the organization, instead of wasting time looking at data that shows nothing of value. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-solution-high-speed-data-monitoring"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Solution: High Speed Data Monitoring
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two organizations that have witnessed this problem with industrial clients time and time again recently joined forces to tackle it with a highly effective solution. &lt;a href="https://harperdb.io/"&gt;HarperDB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://casne.com/"&gt;Casne Engineering&lt;/a&gt; have partnered to develop high performance data acquisition and in line analytics capabilities that enable organizations to capture sub-second data streams from industrial control systems like PLC’s and SCADA systems. The solution then filters out the massive amounts of irrelevant data at the edge, and forwards only the pertinent or anomaly data for use in OT historians and machine learning applications. Filtering out the noise at the edge, on or next to the machinery itself, saves the organization significant time and money. In traditional systems there are two likely scenarios; send all of the data for later analytics, or only capture a fraction of the data at low frequency rates and hope to catch any important information. In the first case, all of the data is forwarded to on-premise cloud systems where data scientists can determine what data is important for analytics - an expensive solution that quickly overwhelms the underlying servers with noise. In the second scenario, collecting low frequency datasets could overlook important thresholds which only occur at high data rates. These overlooked signals could predict failures that lead to downtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This high frequency in-line analytics approach allows operators to gain &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; real-time insights and detect anomalies that would normally be missed using traditional low frequency data collection techniques. HarperDB’s data management solution enables organizations to efficiently collect, process, and analyze data streams in conjunction with other unstructured data including machine vision, geospatial, and Internet data feeds. By implementing HarperDB with Casne’s industry experts, clients can build data flows that greatly improve visibility and reduce costs. Implementing event triggering and anomaly detection can also help to identify and avoid bottlenecks. The joint solution extracts only the data pertinent to their operations and forwards the information directly to existing plant historians, SCADA systems, reporting systems, and work management systems, ultimately reducing unnecessary data and streamlining overall operations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HarperDB and Casne recently completed a project for a client in the utilities / energy sector, where they were able to capture high resolution data to predict and prevent equipment failures and downtime with a single data management solution from plant to cloud. You can access and download the &lt;a href="https://harperdb.io/download-harperdb-casne-casestudy/"&gt;case study to learn more here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thinking upstream about the White House cybersecurity executive order</title>
      <author>Donald Fischer</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 16:42:17 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/tidelift/thinking-upstream-about-the-white-house-cybersecurity-executive-order-1h89</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;The upstream parable&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop me if you’ve heard this one before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Three friends are relaxing beside a river. Suddenly, they hear the sound of someone crying out for help.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looking out into the river, they see a child flailing in the middle of a strong current. The first friend moves quickly, jumping in and swimming as fast as they can to get the child and pull them to safety.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Before the first friend is able to get back to shore, there are more cries for help. Three additional children are in the river, in need of urgent rescue. The second friend, knowing he must rescue all three at once, grabs a nearby raft and paddles out into the river.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile more children keep popping up, all needing rescue. This second friend, overwhelmed, desperately looks around for the third friend, who is nowhere to be seen. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finally, he spots her, in the river, swimming upstream.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Where are you going, these children are going to drown!” calls out the second friend.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third friend keeps swimming and calls back: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I’m going upstream to find out who is throwing all of these children in the river!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is upstream thinking?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This parable is at the heart of what is known as &lt;em&gt;upstream thinking&lt;/em&gt;. In his recent bestseller &lt;a href="https://heathbrothers.com/books/upstream/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Upstream: The Quest to Solve Problems Before They Happen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, author Dan Heath introduces the concept this way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So often in life, we get stuck in a cycle of response. We put out fires. We deal with emergencies. We stay downstream, handling one problem after another, but we never make our way upstream to fix the systems that caused the problems. Cops chase robbers, and doctors treat patients with chronic diseases, and call-center reps address customer complaints. But crime and chronic disease and customer complaints are preventable! So why do our efforts skew so heavily toward reaction rather than prevention?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if &lt;em&gt;downstream thinking&lt;/em&gt; focuses on solving problems after they occur (fishing children out of the water, in our parable), &lt;em&gt;upstream thinking&lt;/em&gt; focuses on efforts to prevent problems before they occur (“I’m going to find out who is throwing all of these children in the river!”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who practice upstream thinking, also known as &lt;em&gt;upstreamists&lt;/em&gt;, are systems-level thinkers, seeking to understand the root causes of downstream emergencies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Upstream thinking and the White House cybersecurity executive order&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to the recent &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;White House cybersecurity executive order&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="/cyber-security-executive-order" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;we’ve done a full debrief on here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: the cybersecurity executive order is an attempt by the United States government to use its purchasing power to create positive changes to the way cybersecurity is addressed around the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent high profile breaches like the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack or the SolarWinds software supply chain attack have shown that our cybersecurity defenses are woefully inadequate. This executive order forces a higher standard of cybersecurity for any organization selling software to the federal government, which in turn makes it the de facto global standard for all software in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I read the executive order for the first time, I couldn’t help but think it provides an incredible opportunity to apply upstream thinking to software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;In open source, the focus has been downstream for too long&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sticking with our parable for a second, when we look closely at the problems that open source software has faced when it comes to cybersecurity, most work over the past few years has gone into &lt;span&gt;developing downstream solutions that help those already in crisis&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, an entire industry has cropped up around software composition analysis (SCA) and container scanning tools that will tell you what is wrong with your software from a security or licensing perspective. This kind of open source urgent care has become a big business, with companies raising hundreds of millions of dollars and grabbing the attention of frustrated CIOs who don’t want to go down in flames as “the next Equifax.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But are we really content to continue being overwhelmed by a never-ending parade of open source health crises? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or should we instead turn our attention upstream?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Spurring an upstream movement in open source&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On June 7, Tidelift will be hosting a completely free, virtual event to celebrate open source and the people who create it, and we’ve named it Upstream (&lt;a href="http://upstream.live/" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;sign up here!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_(software_development)" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;From the Wikipedia definition of upstream, as it relates to software development&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In software development, upstream refers to a direction toward the original authors or maintainers of software that is distributed as source code, and is a qualification of either a version (released by the original authors, based on their upstream source code), a bug or a patch.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our original intent with this name was to honor the work of the people who create and maintain the open source code that all of our applications rely on: the upstream maintainers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we also loved the dual meaning, that this event could serve as an opportunity to spur a movement of upstream thinking in our open source corner of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Dan Heath’s book shares examples of upstreamists operating in many different fields, healthcare is probably the field where upstream thinking has seen the most traction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some broader perspective and inspiration, we’ve invited one of the leading upstreamists in healthcare, Dr. Rishi Manchanda, to give a keynote at Upstream. If you haven’t seen his TED Talk on upstream thinking, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJEwC4wCM70" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;you can view it here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why wait? We can start applying upstream thinking to open source software security and maintenance issues right now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Applying upstream thinking to open source&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s do a little exercise in upstream thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Problem: managing open source effectively and keeping it secure is an enormous challenge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most organizations, it has become a difficult—if not practically impossible—task to effectively manage the security and maintenance of all of the open source code they use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, a recent Tidelift survey found that only &lt;a href="/finding-4-confidence-in-organizations-open-source-practices-declines-as-size-of-company-grows" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;16% of organizations with over 10,000 employees are extremely confident that their open source is up to date, secure, and well maintained&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile a whopping 39% were not very or not all confident in their practices for managing open source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A downstream solution: scanning &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these organizations have attempted to solve their problem with software composition analysis tools that point out security, maintenance, and licensing issues with their open source dependencies. But too often these tools are introduced late in the development process, and report false positives or issues with no easy resolution. They are in essence crying out, “hey, there are children in the river!!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, we know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leaves developers stuck with bad choices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace problematic packages (with the associated delay, and only possible if good alternatives exist)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rewrite the code yourself (if you have time)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with with an open source maintainer to get the issue fixed upstream (if you can get their attention)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ignore the scanner result (if you want to roll the dice)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Heading upstream to discover root cause&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It begs the question: why &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; there so many issues for scanning tools to find? And could we reduce the open source equivalent of emergency room visits by examining the environmental factors that are causing them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of root causes we could consider for issues in open source, from what motivates scanners to report false positives to how package managers deliver updates. But today I want to focus on one root cause that is staring us right in the face. It was perhaps most poignantly captured by &lt;a href="https://xkcd.com/2347/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;this recent xkcd cartoon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://xkcd.com/2347/" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PazWb_EJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://f.hubspotusercontent30.net/hubfs/4008838/dependency_2x-credit.jpg" alt="dependency_2x-credit"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In open source, the majority of people writing the code that modern digital infrastructure depends on are volunteers or are grossly under-compensated for their work. In other words, random people in Nebraska, thanklessly maintaining projects since 2003.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sneak preview of our upcoming maintainer survey results: almost half of maintainers are paid &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt;—not one cent—for their work, while more than half are paid &lt;em&gt;less than $1,000 US per year&lt;/em&gt;. Only 6% are paid what might be considered a living wage (more than $50,000 US per year).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which means that for most maintainers, open source is more of a hobby than a profession. It just happens to be a hobby &lt;span&gt;that all organizations are counting on them to keep doing, to an enterprise standard, without compensation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t take a neurosurgeon to uncover the root cause here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;An upstream solution: partner with maintainers and users to improve software health and security&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which leaves us with some simple truths:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enterprises building applications on top of the modern open source digital infrastructure need open source they can rely on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open source maintainers should be fully compensated if we expect them to deliver secure, well maintained software built to an enterprise standard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might seem kinda obvious, but one solution is to build a model where maintainers get paid to do the work enterprise users need them to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many security issues could be avoided if maintainers were being properly compensated to ensure their components stayed secure and up to date? Even more interesting: how much amazing open source software isn’t even being created today because there aren’t incentives in place for the people who might create and maintain it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Rishi Manchanda’s TED Talk about upstream thinking, he tells the story of Veronica, who appeared in his clinic suffering from debilitating migraine headaches and severe allergies. Multiple visits, multiple treatments, nothing could fix what was wrong with her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until Dr. Manchanda asked her about where she lived. It turned out that her house was moldy, wet, and roach-infested. Instead of prescribing another medication to treat her symptoms, the doctor referred her to a specialist who could help her improve her housing conditions. As if by magic, once her housing conditions improved, her migraine headaches and allergies disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we really want to address the health and security of open source, it’s time to get &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; house in order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s pay the maintainers and get a head start on tackling a principal root cause of open source cyber insecurity once and for all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you're interested in exploring this topic further, &lt;a href="https://upstream.live/"&gt;please join us on June 7 for Upstream&lt;/a&gt;, a free online one-day celebration of open source, the developers who use it, and the maintainers who create it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What **is** Kubernetes? 🤷🏼‍♀️</title>
      <author>JavaScript➕Coffee🚀</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 16:21:51 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/javascriptcoff1/what-is-kubernetes-ljm</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/javascriptcoff1/what-is-kubernetes-ljm</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was challenged on Twitter to write an article about Kubernetes. Here we go...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#glossary"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Glossary:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bandwidth&lt;/strong&gt;: The capacity. How much data can be transferred. &lt;br&gt;
Can also be a word used to describe free time by techy people "how much bandwidth do you have today?" 🤨&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Load balancer&lt;/strong&gt;: Something that...balances the load... of traffic to a site. Makes sure that data and traffic to the site are distributed evenly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌮&lt;em&gt;You're going to want to read my short &lt;a href="https://dev.to/javascriptcoff1/what-is-docker-3be2"&gt;What *&lt;em&gt;is *&lt;/em&gt; Docker?&lt;/a&gt; article if you don't know what Docker is before we hit the road here. I know there are usually no prerequisites to my articles, but this is an exception!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#theres-a-theme-here"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  There's a theme here...
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/em&gt; is the Greek word for a helmsman or someone that steers a ship. ⛴&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#hold-that-thought"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Hold that thought.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-scenario"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The scenario
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine you (and Randall, from the Docker article) have a site up and running with a Docker container. It's doing pretty darn well. You are getting a lot of visitors to your site, and business is great.&lt;br&gt;
Sometimes, you get &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; many visitors to the site and it crashes...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not good&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your site is starting to crash a lot - too many people are visiting and the server is just getting overstretched. It can't handle it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do we do?!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You set up another container on another server. That way, you've got twice the amount of &lt;em&gt;bandwidth&lt;/em&gt; to play with, and in theory, you should be able to have twice the amount of visitors.&lt;br&gt;
You also set up a &lt;em&gt;load balancer&lt;/em&gt; to make sure that visitors are evenly distributed between your servers to ensure that there are no more problems.&lt;br&gt;
Easy, problem solved, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wrong&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your business is &lt;strong&gt;incredible&lt;/strong&gt;, you go viral and suddenly you have a ridiculous number of visitors to your site. Everything is great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hold on...these servers can't handle it...&lt;br&gt;
You set up another 20+ servers (just to be sure this time), which all need Docker containers and some extra load balancers to help manage the bandwidth distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This process is called Horizontal Scaling&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all takes a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of work, and don't even &lt;strong&gt;think&lt;/strong&gt; about making any update to your website...&lt;br&gt;
This is putting a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; of pressure on you, and you are considering hiring another engineer...💭$$$$$$$$$$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Or...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💭 Imagine if you could &lt;em&gt;automate&lt;/em&gt; this server/container duplication process...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, my friends, I have some news for you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#kubernetes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Kubernetes 🦸‍♀️
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so, let's imagine that you knew about Kubernetes right at the beginning. You start to use it when you have just one or 2 servers running with Docker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Kubernetes, your Docker image (the server with the container and everything that you need to run your website) is called a pod&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Kubernetes comprises of the 'master' (its official name) and 'worker nodes'.&lt;br&gt;
The worker nodes do all the heavy lifting in terms of storing, transferring and receiving data around the sites and between the servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the premise of Kubernetes is like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You decide how many 'worker nodes' you want (typically the same number of servers that you have)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You give the 'Kubernetes master' (this is the official name) a list of the number of pods (servers) that you need in the form of a &lt;code&gt;.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file. This is called the manifest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Kubernetes master takes a look at the manifest that you have given it and assigns the pods out to the worker nodes. Pods are assigned to the worker nodes depending on how much work they are already doing. Pretty clever, right?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can control the number of pods through the command line and have direct access to information about your pods and worker nodes, such as their name, IP address and other info. You can also update the &lt;code&gt;.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file through the command line with &lt;code&gt;cubectl edit deployment&lt;/code&gt; and then your &lt;code&gt;.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file name. Imagine it as handing a supervisor in charge of a workforce an updated task list. It is their job to make sure that work is distributed evenly and that no one worker node is over or underworked.&lt;br&gt;
The master node monitors the amount of work that each worker node is doing - if anything looks like it is going to crash or become unstable, it will re-distribute the work. &lt;em&gt;Smart, right?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#yes-but-thats-not-all"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Yes, but that's not all...!
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So these pods that are created, and the images that are inside them, all have their own IP addresses. Great, they are all accessible to the outside world and each version of your site can be reached by the public, and by you, if you want to edit anything.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Wait...how can they be exposed if they are in a pod?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm glad you asked that. This is another powerful feature of Kubernetes.&lt;br&gt;
For the outside world to be able to view your site, you need to expose the pods to the network. If you tell it to, Kubernetes will spin up something called a Service which will act as a load balancer to make sure that none of the pods are getting too much traffic (crash zone!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing that makes it different to a usual load balancer is that Kubernetes will balance the load by pod ID, rather than just balancing across &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; server. This means that you can control everything with a lot more precision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doesn't sound &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; special...?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
💥&lt;br&gt;
It also creates a load balancer in your cloud provider. This means that you update your website in &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; place. 🤯&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Save yourself a lot of time. Orchestrate your containers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#save-even-more-time-managed-kubernetes-options-good-to-know"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Save even more time - managed kubernetes options - good to know...
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While researching for this article, I found out how tricky and in-depth it is to set up. Luckily, there are managed options that do it all for you - Azure's AKS and Amazon's EKS.&lt;br&gt;
If you need to get started with Kubernetes fast, say you've built the next Amazon using Docker containers and you need to future-proof &lt;br&gt;
fast, then I recommend using them while you look into Kubernetes. It is very CLI-heavy and looks like it would take some time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_So that was Kubernetes. So, now we know what it ** is **! ⛴&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Announcing Appwrite 0.8 - an open-source, self-hosted BaaS</title>
      <author>kodumbeats</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 16:11:20 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/appwrite/announcing-appwrite-0-8-an-open-source-self-hosted-baas-kda</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/appwrite/announcing-appwrite-0-8-an-open-source-self-hosted-baas-kda</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We're incredibly excited to announce the release of Appwrite 0.8, packed with a ton of cool new features like &lt;strong&gt;JWT support&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;ARM support&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Anonymous Login&lt;/strong&gt;, and more! Last month, we gave a &lt;a href="https://medium.com/appwrite-io/appwrite-0-8-is-coming-soon-and-this-is-what-you-can-expect-fa8cbed1c0eb"&gt;sneak peek&lt;/a&gt; of some of the changes, and we're back today to keep you waiting no longer. Let's dive in! 🤿&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appwrite is an open-source, self-hosted Backend-as-a-Service that aims to make app development &lt;strong&gt;easier&lt;/strong&gt; with SDKs available in a variety of programming languages. Come hang out with us on &lt;a href="https://appwrite.io/discord"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#anonymous-login-and-jwt"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Anonymous Login and JWT 🔐
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not every app needs users to create an account right away. With &lt;strong&gt;Anonymous Login&lt;/strong&gt;, save sessions without asking for email addresses, and convert those users to registered accounts later with ease. The implementation is just like creating a normal user session via the &lt;a href="https://appwrite.io/docs/client/account?sdk=web#accountCreateSession"&gt;&lt;code&gt;createSession&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; method:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sdk&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Appwrite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sdk&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setEndpoint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;https://[HOSTNAME_OR_IP]/v1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Your API Endpoint&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setProject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;5df5acd0d48c2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Your project ID&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sdk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;account&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createAnonymousSession&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Success&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Failure&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also, if you've ever needed to act as a user from a &lt;a href="https://appwrite.io/docs/sdks"&gt;server SDK&lt;/a&gt;, Appwrite now supports authentication via JSON Web Tokens (&lt;a href="https://jwt.io/"&gt;JWT&lt;/a&gt;). This change allows Appwrite to work with the server-side rendering capabilities of frameworks like &lt;a href="https://nextjs.org/"&gt;Next.js&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://nuxtjs.org/"&gt;Nuxt.js&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/"&gt;Gatsby.js&lt;/a&gt;, as well as unlock user actions from server-side SDKs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, a JWT is created for the user from a Client SDK:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;appwrite&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;account&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createJWT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, the JWT is used to act on behalf of the user server-side:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sdk&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;node-appwrite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sdk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setEndpoint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;https://[HOSTNAME_OR_IP]/v1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Your API Endpoint&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setProject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;5df5acd0d48c2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Your project ID&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setJWT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;919c2d18fb5d4...a2ae413da83346ad2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Your JWT&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#arm-support"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ARM Support 🦾
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ARM ecosystem has been booming since Apple's M1 processors landed in their new lineup of devices. Starting with 0.8, install Appwrite on your favorite 64-bit ARM device, from Amazon Graviton2 down to the Raspberry Pi 4! [1] ARM support falls in line with our mission to make Appwrite &lt;strong&gt;technology agnostic&lt;/strong&gt;, and we're excited to hear all of the new places where Appwrite can run. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To celebrate this milestone, we have ARM systems to give away as a part of &lt;a href="https://30days.appwrite.io/"&gt;#30DaysofAppwrite&lt;/a&gt;! 🥳 Through the month of May, we're building a Medium.com blog clone to demonstrate how &lt;strong&gt;easy&lt;/strong&gt; the developer experience is with Appwrite, and we invite you to build alongside us. Eligible submissions get some cool 😎 swag, and the best projects will receive Raspberry Pi 4 development kits. 😍&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] For both Graviton2 servers and Raspberry Pis, we recommend at least 2GB of RAM for the best Appwrite experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#control-your-console"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Control your Console 🖥️
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've updated the console with a few new goodies. First, if you enable the new "root" account setting, only a single admin account can be created on your Appwrite server. If you need to share access to the Appwrite console, you can restrict account creation to specific IP addresses with the &lt;code&gt;_APP_CONSOLE_WHITELIST_IPS&lt;/code&gt; environment variable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Appwrite 0.8 brings new settings to users - now, you can choose which of our growing authentication methods you'd like to use for your apps: email/password login, anonymous login, JWT auth, and more! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appwrite 0.8 introduces &lt;strong&gt;Python 3.9&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Deno 1.8&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Dart 2.12&lt;/strong&gt; as new runtimes for Cloud Functions. Upgrade existing functions or write new ones! If you're using Cloud Functions in a cool way, let us know on &lt;a href="https://appwrite.io/discord"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#slimmer-and-faster"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Slimmer and Faster ⏩
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll notice Appwrite 0.8 is a bit slimmer on system resources out-of-the-box. We found that the SMTP and antivirus services weren't helping new developers, so we've toggled off ClamAV and the included SMTP server for development. Because of these changes, we have been able to reduce our minimum requirements to &lt;strong&gt;1GB of RAM&lt;/strong&gt; (though we recommend 2GB for the better experience).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also updated our codebase to take advantage of the increased performance of some of our under the hood technologies. Based on our testing, we're seeing improved performance of about 8% compared to previous Appwrite versions 🚀&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#breaking-changes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Breaking Changes ⚒️
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you upgrade your Appwrite server to 0.8, check out the breaking changes that were introduced to see if you need to update any code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://appwrite.io/docs/server/users#usersDeleteUser"&gt;&lt;code&gt;deleteUser&lt;/code&gt; method&lt;/a&gt; in the Users API has been renamed to &lt;code&gt;delete&lt;/code&gt; to remain consistent with the rest of the API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only logged in users &lt;a href="https://appwrite.io/docs/client/account?sdk=web#accountCreateSession"&gt;with active sessions&lt;/a&gt; can execute functions. If your app relies on this behavior, check out Anonymous Login.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only the user who &lt;a href="https://appwrite.io/docs/client/functions?sdk=web#functionsCreateExecution"&gt;triggers an execution&lt;/a&gt; gets access to the relevant execution logs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://appwrite.io/docs/client/teams?sdk=web#teamsCreateMembership"&gt;&lt;code&gt;createMembership&lt;/code&gt; method&lt;/a&gt; has a new rate limit of 10 requests per 60 minutes per IP address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://appwrite.io/docs/environment-variables"&gt;environment variable&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;_APP_FUNCTIONS_ENVS&lt;/code&gt; has been renamed to &lt;code&gt;APP_FUNCTIONS_RUNTIMES&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several function execution environment variables have been renamed:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;APPWRITE_FUNCTION_EVENT_PAYLOAD&lt;/code&gt; is now &lt;code&gt;APPWRITE_FUNCTION_EVENT_DATA&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;APPWRITE_FUNCTION_ENV_NAME&lt;/code&gt; is now &lt;code&gt;APPWRITE_FUNCTION_RUNTIME_NAME&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;APPWRITE_FUNCTION_ENV_VERSION&lt;/code&gt; is now &lt;code&gt;APPWRITE_FUNCTION_RUNTIME_VERSION&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#and-more"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  And More! 😍
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's not all!

      <title>Distributed embeddings cluster</title>
      <author>David Mezzetti</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/neuml/distributed-embeddings-cluster-24gg</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/neuml/txtai/blob/master/examples/15_Distributed_embeddings_cluster.ipynb"&gt;&lt;img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/84f0493939e0c4de4e6dbe113251b4bfb5353e57134ffd9fcab6b8714514d4d1/68747470733a2f2f636f6c61622e72657365617263682e676f6f676c652e636f6d2f6173736574732f636f6c61622d62616467652e737667" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is part of a tutorial series on &lt;a href="https://github.com/neuml/txtai"&gt;txtai&lt;/a&gt;, an AI-powered search engine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The txtai API is a web-based service backed by &lt;a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/"&gt;FastAPI&lt;/a&gt;. All txtai functionality is available via the API. The API can also cluster multiple embeddings indices into a single logical index to horizontally scale over multiple nodes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This notebook installs the txtai API and shows an example of building an embeddings cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#install-dependencies"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Install dependencies
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install &lt;code&gt;txtai&lt;/code&gt; and all dependencies.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;txtai
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#start-distributed-embeddings-cluster"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Start distributed embeddings cluster
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we'll start multiple API instances that will serve as embeddings index shards. Each shard stores a subset of the indexed data and these shards work in tandem to form a single logical index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we'll start the main API instance that clusters the shards together into a logical instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The API instances are all started in the background.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;chdir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/content"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;writable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Embeddings settings&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;embeddings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;method&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;transformers&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;sentence-transformers/bert-base-nli-mean-tokens&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Embeddings cluster&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;cluster&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;shards&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;http://127.0.0.1:8001&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;http://127.0.0.1:8002&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Start embeddings shards&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;CONFIG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;index.yml &lt;span class="nb"&gt;nohup &lt;/span&gt;uvicorn &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--port&lt;/span&gt; 8001 &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"txtai.api:app"&lt;/span&gt; &amp;amp;&amp;gt; shard-1.log &amp;amp;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;CONFIG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;index.yml &lt;span class="nb"&gt;nohup &lt;/span&gt;uvicorn &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--port&lt;/span&gt; 8002 &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"txtai.api:app"&lt;/span&gt; &amp;amp;&amp;gt; shard-2.log &amp;amp;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Start main instance&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;CONFIG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;cluster.yml &lt;span class="nb"&gt;nohup &lt;/span&gt;uvicorn &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--port&lt;/span&gt; 8000 &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"txtai.api:app"&lt;/span&gt; &amp;amp;&amp;gt; main.log &amp;amp;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Wait for startup&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sleep &lt;/span&gt;90
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#python"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Python
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's first try the cluster out directly in Python. The code below aggregates the two shards into a single cluster and executes actions against the cluster.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;txtai.api&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Cluster&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;cluster&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Cluster&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"shards"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"http://127.0.0.1:8001"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"http://127.0.0.1:8002"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]})&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;"US tops 5 million confirmed virus cases"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Canada's last fully intact ice shelf has suddenly collapsed, forming a Manhattan-sized iceberg"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Beijing mobilises invasion craft along coast as Taiwan tensions escalate"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;"The National Park Service warns against sacrificing slower friends in a bear attack"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Maine man wins $1M from $25 lottery ticket"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Make huge profits without work, earn up to $100,000 a day"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Index data
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cluster&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"id"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"text"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;row&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;enumerate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;cluster&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Test search
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;uid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cluster&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;search&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"feel good story"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"id"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Query: feel good story&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;Result:"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;uid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Query: feel good story
Result: Maine man wins $1M from $25 lottery ticket
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#javascript"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  JavaScript
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next let's try to run the same code above via the API using JavaScript.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;txtai
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For this example, we'll clone the txtai.js project to import the example build configuration.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/neuml/txtai.js
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#run-clusterjs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Run cluster.js
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following script is a JavaScript version of the logic above&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Embeddings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;txtai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sprintf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;sprintf-js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;embeddings&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Embeddings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;argv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;US tops 5 million confirmed virus cases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                     &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Canada's last fully intact ice shelf has suddenly collapsed, forming a Manhattan-sized iceberg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                     &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Beijing mobilises invasion craft along coast as Taiwan tensions escalate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                     &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;The National Park Service warns against sacrificing slower friends in a bear attack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                     &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Maine man wins $1M from $25 lottery ticket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                     &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Make huge profits without work, earn up to $100,000 a day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;repeat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;uid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sprintf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;%-20s %s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;uid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]))&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;trace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#build-and-run-clusterjs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Build and run cluster.js
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;txtai.js/examples/node
npm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install
&lt;/span&gt;npm run build
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next lets run the code against the main cluster URL&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;node dist/cluster.js http://127.0.0.1:8000
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Querying an Embeddings cluster
Query                Best Match
--------------------------------------------------
feel good story      Maine man wins $1M from $25 lottery ticket

wildlife             The National Park Service warns against sacrificing slower friends in a bear attack
asia                 Beijing mobilises invasion craft along coast as Taiwan tensions escalate
north america        US tops 5 million confirmed virus cases
dishonest junk       Make huge profits without work, earn up to $100,000 a day
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The JavaScript program is showing the same results as the Python code above. This is running a clustered query against both nodes in the cluster and aggregating the results together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Queries can be run against each individual shard to see what the queries independently return.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;node dist/cluster.js http://127.0.0.1:8001
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Querying an Embeddings cluster
Query                Best Match
--------------------------------------------------

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;node dist/cluster.js http://127.0.0.1:8002
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Querying an Embeddings cluster
Query                Best Match
-------------------------------------------------------

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Note the differences. The section below runs a count against the full cluster and each shard to show the count of records in each.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/count
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
curl http://127.0.0.1:8001/count
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
curl http://127.0.0.1:8002/count
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;6
3

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This notebook showed how a distributed embeddings cluster can be created with txtai. This example can be further scaled out on Kubernetes with StatefulSets, which will be covered in a future tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>LitmusChaos at Kubecon EU '21
</title>
      <author>Karthik Satchitanand</author>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;KubeCon is veritably a festival for the tech community nowadays, and this is a sentiment that I have expressed several times before, but cannot tire of repeating! The sheer diversity of content (organized into a neat set of tracks), the announcements &amp;amp; launches, predictions, and panel discussions, all add to the excitement. I even managed to get my young nephew interested in the Cloud Native world by ordering the Phippy &amp;amp; friends buildable set with my Speaker giveaway! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pJxgN58m--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/owfs7o8h7yuzgrv9ikdb.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pJxgN58m--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/owfs7o8h7yuzgrv9ikdb.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For us, as members of the LitmusChaos project &amp;amp; the broader cloud native chaos engineering community, this edition of Kubecon EU '21  turned out to be sweeter still.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The predictions made ahead of the event by Cheryl Hung, VP, Ecosystem at CNCF, where she noted the growing interest in chaos, set the ball rolling (and this came on the back of similar observations made by Liz Rice, the chair of CNCF’s Technical Oversight Committee (ToC) at the November 2020 Kubecon): &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9W7AouKJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21166217/118844085-4be2a480-b8e8-11eb-9f05-fbee16fd4b7f.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9W7AouKJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21166217/118844085-4be2a480-b8e8-11eb-9f05-fbee16fd4b7f.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From inside CNCF I have a unique insight into cloud native tech, DevOps and ecosystem. Here’s what I see coming next!&lt;a href="https://t.co/KeqcQCC3E7"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/KeqcQCC3E7"&gt;https://t.co/KeqcQCC3E7&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/e7uoq0aXXz"&gt;pic.twitter.com/e7uoq0aXXz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Cheryl Hung (@oicheryl) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oicheryl/status/1374419739489886212?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;This added to the organic interest that Litmus as a project has gathered in the CNCF community, and resulted in some wonderful responses to the various presentations/talks that it featured in. All this led to newer slack members, appreciative messages from those that grokked the project, more questions on what’s coming &amp;amp; roadmap, quick feedback from folks that tried it, and some cool issues and PRs in the process! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, let us do a quick round-up of the talks/sessions where Litmus “appeared”. Some of the perspectives expressed are instructive and definitely hold value for us at the project. I have also tried to capture all the buzz (via tweets, of course) around Litmus and provide links to the awesome presentations around the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-roundup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Round-Up
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First up, was the whirlwind sandbox projects tour by Justin Cormack, CTO, Docker,  where he &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/XmMbzBuCuYw?t=462"&gt;introduced Litmus&lt;/a&gt; as a way to package &amp;amp; perform your own custom chaos experiments. The talk prompted some awesome cloud-native advocates &amp;amp; tech-gurus to recall some deep dives on the project that had been performed in recent times! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--R9GkVJGY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21166217/118844394-8d734f80-b8e8-11eb-9796-aaa59049aa73.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--R9GkVJGY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21166217/118844394-8d734f80-b8e8-11eb-9796-aaa59049aa73.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year we've been taking a deep dive into the CNCF Sandbox on our blog, and so far we've covered &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kubevirt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@kubevirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LitmusChaos?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@LitmusChaos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/telepresenceio?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@telepresenceio&lt;/a&gt;. But &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/justincormack?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@justincormack&lt;/a&gt; just blew us out of the water running through all 50 projects in 15min! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/KubeCon?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#KubeCon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/qh9eVE4q3N"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/qh9eVE4q3N"&gt;https://t.co/qh9eVE4q3N&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— LiveWyer (@LiveWyerUK) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LiveWyerUK/status/1389891093605634051?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our KubeCon talk, on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DgCc4-BLW8"&gt;Putting Chaos into Continuous Delivery to increase Application resilience&lt;/a&gt; along with the fantastic team at Keptn, was well attended with many questions on the philosophy of automated chaos. For those interested, there is more coming on the integration with Keptn, including some very cool use cases around auto-remediation!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AdgCTfkq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21166217/118845328-50f42380-b8e9-11eb-9037-915e7d99afaf.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AdgCTfkq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21166217/118845328-50f42380-b8e9-11eb-9037-915e7d99afaf.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key takeaways from the talk! 😍&lt;br&gt;Glad to have &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KitopiHQ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@KitopiHQ&lt;/a&gt; as an adopter of both &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keptnProject?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@keptnProject&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LitmusChaos?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@LitmusChaos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This establishes a process of continuously evaluating resiliency! &lt;a href="https://t.co/Rs8QvoKogk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Rs8QvoKogk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— LitmusChaos (Chaos Engineering for Kubernetes) (&lt;a class="mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/litmuschaos"&gt;@litmuschaos&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alois Reitbauer (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AloisReitbauer"&gt;https://twitter.com/AloisReitbauer&lt;/a&gt;), co-chair of the CNCF SIG-App Delivery, presented &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/74VpVe-pZx0?t=1481"&gt;some interesting findings in this space&lt;/a&gt;, with Chaos Engineering &amp;amp; Litmus getting special mention. He discussed some common experimentation trends, and how organizations are embracing a shift left approach with chaos. And what better than validation of these thoughts from the experts at Gitlab! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Next up was probably the &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/btGFt5-37hs?t=740"&gt;most interesting demo&lt;/a&gt; (one that followed a nice intro/whiteboard session) involving litmus in the Kubecon. Saiyam (Civo) &amp;amp; Karthik (Verica) presented how one could leverage the GitOps &amp;amp; Event-triggered chaos features in the Litmus platform to test the sanity of the changes made to your application deployments on the cluster. It also had some cool takeaways on how you should approach chaos engineering &amp;amp; up your reliability game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;  

&lt;p&gt;In between the various talks, we had the opportunity to hold the Office Hours (thanks a ton to the CNCF for organizing this) where community members, first time users got a chance to learn about the project &amp;amp; the advanced ones to probe us on the roadmap :). What better than waking up to messages like this from folks that attended the office hours: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amidst all this, we had our SIG-Docs lead &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Divya_Mohan02"&gt;@Divya_Mohan02&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=445UZFpbG90&amp;amp;list=PLHgdNuGxrJt0ZHXZlIxDi6DTdfJbXGFo1&amp;amp;index=15"&gt;participating&lt;/a&gt; in the awesome DoKC Day (Data on Kubernetes Community), where she shared her contribution journey in LitmusChaos, what it means to break things intentionally &amp;amp; how folks can get involved with the project. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What Are GANs? Generative Adversarial Networks Explained</title>
      <author>nponte-zumo</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 15:40:14 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/npontezumo/what-are-gans-generative-adversarial-networks-explained-1b88</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/npontezumo/what-are-gans-generative-adversarial-networks-explained-1b88</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generative Adversarial Networks&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;GANs&lt;/strong&gt;, are an implementation of a &lt;strong&gt;Generative Model&lt;/strong&gt; [Figure 1]. A generative model is a neural network which is trained to output a new example (e.g. an image) from a distribution of provided examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tNdsT2S5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h4qq2w8jge2mfirlrhz0.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tNdsT2S5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h4qq2w8jge2mfirlrhz0.png" alt="Figure 1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GANs are composed of two parts: the &lt;strong&gt;Generator&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;Discriminator&lt;/strong&gt; [Figure 2]. The Generator and the Discriminator are two separate neural networks: their goal is to transform a given input into a desired output. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pKoj3Eof--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vgn6t6gxq38f3999a3cx.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pKoj3Eof--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vgn6t6gxq38f3999a3cx.png" alt="Figure 2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Generator&lt;/strong&gt; is a generative model: given a random vector of noise this network will generate something which is within the distribution of the training data. The &lt;strong&gt;Discriminator&lt;/strong&gt; is a model trained to return the probability that the input example came from the original training data—that is, is from the same statistical distribution—and was not just randomly generated [Figure 3]. &lt;strong&gt;Think of the Generator as an art forger and the discriminator as an art evaluator.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dWSdfYld--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/himrxa8z4esjtnpyb886.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dWSdfYld--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/himrxa8z4esjtnpyb886.png" alt="Figure 3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these models are trained to achieve that same end goal by using &lt;strong&gt;back propagation&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Back propagation&lt;/strong&gt; is the process of iteratively moving the weights of the neural network towards the desired goal [Figure 4]. The Generator and the Discriminator (borrowing some concepts from game theory) are placed as adversaries, allowing them to train each other to be better at their respective tasks: generating and discriminating. Though trained in tandem, the ultimate goal is really to train a strong generative model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_cxFuXQ9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6vi3b61eifzyvjaeube7.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_cxFuXQ9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6vi3b61eifzyvjaeube7.png" alt="Figure 4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#important-literature"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Important Literature
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're just getting into GANs, I suggest starting with Generative Adversarial Nets [1] which was the first paper to propose the GAN architecture. This paper introduces the foundational math and basic structure that allows this adversarial system to function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most “modern” GANs have similar architectures to the one proposed in the paper Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks [2] or &lt;strong&gt;DCGANs&lt;/strong&gt;. This paper provides guidance on using &lt;strong&gt;Convolutional Neural Networks&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;CNNs&lt;/strong&gt; in a GAN framework. Using this new architecture, they are able to identify parts of the model state or weights it is using for certain representations. The research team was able to empirically identify what parts of the model was encoding the logic about windows in a room generator and then use that knowledge to determine if the network was learning a true internal representation of what makes a room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---D787IS5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/o5ih6xyxqlazhe84ajel.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---D787IS5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/o5ih6xyxqlazhe84ajel.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another paper, titled Improved Techniques for Training GANs [3], suggests a series of concepts that aim to navigate common pitfalls and train more robust Generator and Discriminator models. This paper uses these techniques to demonstrate significant improvements over existing models for both simple and complex representations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--E8RO4dfT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x20cdz8y8i3rsbiti631.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--E8RO4dfT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x20cdz8y8i3rsbiti631.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, one of the more impressive GAN implementations belongs to the authors of A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks [4]. This last paper borrows style-transfer techniques to train better Generators, specifically Generators which separate high-level attributes from variations. This technique allows us to generate examples that are influenced by a specific style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GCjUWvVP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pllor2d4w1s4afdmv0rr.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GCjUWvVP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pllor2d4w1s4afdmv0rr.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why the Data Matters
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally—since we're Zumo Labs—I'll leave you with some cool examples of how GANs can be used to tackle the data problem that's at the very heart of machine learning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the core issues with most collected data is that most machine learning models used in production are trained using supervised learning, where a label is necessary for the model to learn from an image. GANs have been tackling this problem by learning how to generate labels from an unlabeled input image. The images below are some examples from Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks [5] and RenderGAN: Generating Realistic Labeled Data [6]. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sQAJ3NOw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uosi5akge8li14xk6e0i.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sQAJ3NOw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uosi5akge8li14xk6e0i.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Zumo Labs, we think the future of machine learning involves mapping configurable simulations to real world use cases. However, in some cases, it's currently more expensive to model all of these scenarios than it is to go take images of these scenarios and manually annotate them. In order to decrease the cost of these virtual worlds, machine learning can be used to learn a mapping between a configurable environment and the real world. This can be seen below in the paper GANcraft: Unsupervised 3D Neural Rendering of Minecraft Worlds [7] where a GAN is used to generate 3D photo-realistic worlds from Minecraft worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wKWukrKU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8agbh62ztjhcb5miw4js.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wKWukrKU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8agbh62ztjhcb5miw4js.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year I wrote a Dev.to post entitled &lt;a href="https://dev.to/jamesncox/how-long-35co"&gt;How long did you have to wait?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I detailed my job application experience at the time, having applied to quite a few roles and receiving literally zero calls. It was a rough time, and I received a lot of great feedback from that article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#update"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Update
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward to now, 15 months after graduating bootcamp, and still unemployed: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I received a rejection email from a company I had been interviewing with for several weeks. This one really stung. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I even &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MemRook/status/1394734126515859461?s=20"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; about it and was blessed with an incredible amount of support, feedback, and advice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This company had reached out to me. They wanted to hire several juniors and thought I would be a great fit. I was very transparent with my experience and they were transparent with their hiring process. I loved the company culture and thought this would be an ideal fit for both them and myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to create a todo app for a code challenge, and I went above and beyond their criteria. I had so much for with it, I even put it in my portfolio. Check out The Matrix Todo app here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://the-matrix-todo.netlify.app/"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6mZPC64_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/70w7s5felohrx9byojt0.jpg" alt="The Matrix Todo with the Matrix green scroll code as a background"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday they informed me they wanted more senior developers and that they appreciate my time and effort, but I was no longer in consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking for your first developer role can be incredibly stressful. It is a full-time job itself, and in many cases a mentally-draining grind that can often feel like there is no hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want you to know that if you are in a similar situation, I see you. And I am here for you if you need to talk about your experiences or just rant about anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is meant to both offer insight and support for anyone else struggling to find their first role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that a big factor in finding your first role is about being in the right place at the right time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to thank everyone who has been so kind and supportive this entire process. Thank you to my community for always being there for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you feel alone, please know you are NOT alone. Reach out to me or someone you trust and I will help you connect with some great people who will embrace your journey and support you however they can. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know in the comments if you have any specific stories or experiences you would like to share. We need to lift each other up in these moments and realize that we are all in this together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading. Much love and respect ❤️🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Understanding Docker: part 33 – Tools: Skopeo</title>
      <author>Aurélie Vache</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 15:28:06 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding Docker can be difficult or time-consuming. In order to spread knowledge about Cloud technologies I started to create sketchnotes about Docker. I think it could be a good way, more visual, to explain Docker (and other technologies like Kubernetes and Istio).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continue the series of Docker sketchnotes with an useful tool: skopeo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2l7IcBvM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g72vbtf9nd0nmctja0qx.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2l7IcBvM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g72vbtf9nd0nmctja0qx.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--J_o825ze--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b40m6s0acsgrkqf01hak.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--J_o825ze--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b40m6s0acsgrkqf01hak.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, if you like theses sketchnotes, you can follow me, and tell me what do you think. I will publish others sketchs shortly :-).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested, I published all the sketchnotes on Docker (and new ones!) to make a "book" of 93 pages: &lt;a href="https://gumroad.com/aurelievache#YTLzM"&gt;"Understanding Docker in a visual way"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What do cats, AWS, machine learning, and neural networks have in common?</title>
      <author>lee</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 15:27:45 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/leewynne/what-do-cats-aws-machine-learning-and-neural-networks-have-in-common-3040</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/leewynne/what-do-cats-aws-machine-learning-and-neural-networks-have-in-common-3040</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Learning about machine learning and neural networks can seem daunting. It sounds hugely complex and out of reach of learning for some people, but it doesn't have to be.. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For help, look no further than that furry, anti-social, hissing, fish-loving, saber-toothed, 'not so sure if he would kill you if he/she were bigger', head-butting, tinkle-tush wearing (yes that is a real thing, Google it), box pooping, hairball coughing, carboard box loving, butt licking, personal space invading idiot of a feline friend of yours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/l2JJDdD7cv4xdGGis/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/l2JJDdD7cv4xdGGis/giphy.gif" alt="Learn AWS Machine Learning Rekognition"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do Cats have to do with machine learning again? Well, it all begins with a quest to learn more about how machine learning works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, AWS has a done a great job of abstracting some of the most popular models for machine learning and made them available as off-the-shelve services which means that in order to use them, all you need to do is interface with the API for that particular service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you are just beginning your quest to understand machine learning that isn't a great place to start, is it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YouTube is obviously a great way of picking up the concepts of machine learning and how neural networks learn. Here are some of the best I have seen so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aircAruvnKk"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It get's way more complex after that first video!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IHZwWFHWa-w"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ilg3gGewQ5U"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And good ole Lex Fridman from MIT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O5xeyoRL95U"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is Lex's Podcast btw, you can listen to him right here on &lt;a href="https://www.theelastic.guru/lexfridman-podcast-ai-machine-learning/183-po-shen-loh-mathematics-math-olympiad-combinatorics-contact-tracing"&gt;the elastic guru&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But is it all still fairly complicated and it is likely that you'll hit that steep learning curve and maybe give this whole machine learning and neural network thing a miss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dont-do-that"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  DON'T DO THAT
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machine learning and neural networks (including AI) are going to be big (they are already biiiiiiig) and knowing about it can only pay dividends in the future, trust me, your future self with definitely thank you for it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I am a very visual learner. I take lots in when I can see it conceptually and when I can play with it and see the results, with that in mind, the one thing that I enjoyed the most when learning more about machine learning, was a game called &lt;a href="https://luden.io/wtl/"&gt;while True: learn()&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--m4sybHM0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.theelastic.guru/remoteimages/uploads/articles/9i3dlxl852ng44hqks9y.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--m4sybHM0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.theelastic.guru/remoteimages/uploads/articles/9i3dlxl852ng44hqks9y.png" alt="aws machine learning for beginners"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--e828x-8E--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.theelastic.guru/remoteimages/uploads/articles/hbapvs696q9su91cda6w.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--e828x-8E--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.theelastic.guru/remoteimages/uploads/articles/hbapvs696q9su91cda6w.jpg" alt="learn aws machine learning while true learn game"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;while True: learn() is a puzzle/simulation game about even more puzzling stuff: machine learning, neural networks, big data and AI. But most importantly, it’s about understanding your cat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this game, you play as a coder who accidentally found out that their cat is extremely good at coding, but not as good at speaking human language. Now this coder (it’s you!) must learn all there is to know about machine learning and use visual programming to build a cat-to-human speech recognition system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👆 At least you know now where the cat fits into all this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a brief demo of the gameplay:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hITJdnpP790"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;while true: learn() has great reviews on &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/619150/while_True_learn/"&gt;steam&lt;/a&gt; and trust me, you don't need to be technical at all to play it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can play while true: learn() on &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/619150/while_True_learn/"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/while-true-learn/id1443569124"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nival.wtlm&amp;amp;hl=en_GB&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/while-true-learn/id1443569124"&gt;macOS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creation of while true: learn() also has a fantastic &lt;a href="https://blog.luden.io/while-true-learn-release-or-the-story-about-1-year-of-weekly-updates-machine-learning-and-cats-4ad1884e5d8e"&gt;back story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll give you one hour with the game before it click, you'll know the basics of machine learning and neural networks without reading a single blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Debugging and mocking third party services in Elixir with Mox</title>
      <author>Nick Vernij</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 15:12:42 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/nickforall/debugging-and-mocking-third-party-services-in-elixir-with-mox-3gfb</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/nickforall/debugging-and-mocking-third-party-services-in-elixir-with-mox-3gfb</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Almost every backend application uses them, third party services. Whether it's S3 for object storage, Segment for analytics or Firebase for push notifications. Those services are super helpful and do a lot of heavy-lifting, but in my experience usually do make debugging business logic on your local machine a pain, and testing them isn't easy either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some great solutions available in Elixir. In this post I'm sharing the approach I have been using for the past few years using Elixir. I'll be going over defining behaviours and using them for local debugging during development as well as writing tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#defining-a-behaviour"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Defining a behaviour
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interfaces should be familiar for anyone coming from typed object-oriented languages such as Java or TypeScript. Elixir's equivalent of this is called a &lt;a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/typespecs.html#behaviours"&gt;behaviour&lt;/a&gt;. By using type-specs we can define a module's functions in a behaviour, which can be implemented by multiple modules, usually called "callbacks" in Elixir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are unfamiliar with type-specs, I highly recommend &lt;a href="https://inquisitivedeveloper.com/lmw-elixir-69/"&gt;this comprehensive blog post&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://inquisitivedeveloper.com"&gt;Kevin Peter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this post's example we want to define a simple behaviour that can send a push notification to a user. We're going to write a behaviour module that will describe the function definitions we need to send push notifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a behaviour, each &lt;code&gt;@callback&lt;/code&gt; annotation defines the type-spec of a function that is required on any implementation of this behaviour. For our push notifications use-case the simple behaviour below will do; a single &lt;code&gt;send_push&lt;/code&gt; function that takes a User struct as a recipient and a string as a title for the push notification.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight elixir"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;defmodule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;MyApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;PushBehaviour&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Sends a push notification to the given User with the given title.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Returns :ok if the message was sent or an :error tuple with an error message.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nv"&gt;@callback&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;send_push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;recipient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;MyApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:ok&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#stub-debug-and-production-implementations"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Stub, Debug and Production implementations
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we have determined what our behaviour looks like, we can start thinking about what our implementations may look like. I usually end up writing three implementations, one for each Mix environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Development&lt;/strong&gt;: A behavior that helps us &lt;em&gt;debug&lt;/em&gt; our business logic locally without depending on secrets or even an internet connection. In the case of push notifications we can simply log the user's name and the message they will be receiving to the Elixir &lt;code&gt;Logger&lt;/code&gt;. For other use-cases, like object file storage, we can choose to write/modify/delete files on our local filesystem in a temporary folder instead of to for example Login.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Testing&lt;/strong&gt;: For testing you want to define a "&lt;em&gt;stub"&lt;/em&gt; that doesn't actually do anything with the data, and always acts as if anything you're trying to do is successful. You want to prevent calling your third party vendor hundreds of times while running tests. They may rate-limit you or it may incur costs. In those stubs you always want to return a succesful response, in our case that is &lt;code&gt;:ok&lt;/code&gt;, acting as if the push notification was sent succesfully. We'll go over testing error responses from your behaviour later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Production&lt;/strong&gt;: This will call the third party service, which may be a library, rest API or whatever. Entirely up to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementing a behaviour on a callback module is done by adding the &lt;code&gt;@behaviour&lt;/code&gt; decorator as well as implementing all of its defined callbacks. Here are some example implementations for our Stub, Debug and Production implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our stub implementation will always return &lt;code&gt;:ok&lt;/code&gt;, it's there mainly to not raise any errors while running tests or compiling your app.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight elixir"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;defmodule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;MyApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;StubPush&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nv"&gt;@moduledoc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sd"&gt;"""
  Do nothing. Always succeed.
  """&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nv"&gt;@behaviour&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;MyApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;PushBehaviour&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;send_push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:ok&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our debug implementation will use &lt;code&gt;Logger&lt;/code&gt; to print the recipient's username and the title of the push notification. This is useful when writing your application locally and trying out your code without having to connect to your third party service.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight elixir"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;defmodule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;MyApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;DebugPush&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nv"&gt;@moduledoc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sd"&gt;"""
  Print a push notification to our logger
  """&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nv"&gt;@behaviour&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;MyApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;PushBehaviour&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kn"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;Logger&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;send_push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="no"&gt;Logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Sending a notification to user @&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; with title &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:ok&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For a production example, I'm assuming we're using a fictional Firebase library for sending notifications. This can be any service or library for your use-case of course.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight elixir"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;defmodule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;MyApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;FirebasePush&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nv"&gt;@moduledoc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sd"&gt;"""
  Send a push notification through firebase
  """&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nv"&gt;@behaviour&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;MyApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;PushBehaviour&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;send_push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="no"&gt;SomeFirebaseLibrary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_send_function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#mocking"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Mocking
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The go-to library for working with mocks in Elixir is &lt;a href="https://github.com/dashbitco/mox"&gt;Mox&lt;/a&gt;, authored by José Valim. Follow the &lt;a href="https://github.com/dashbitco/mox#installation"&gt;instructions on their docs to have it installed&lt;/a&gt; so we can jump straight into setting up testing for our application's push notification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we're going to head over to &lt;code&gt;test_helper.exs&lt;/code&gt; in your project. Every Elixir project with tests will have this file generated by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to add a mock with &lt;code&gt;Mox.defmock&lt;/code&gt;. This generates a module based on the behaviour we pass it. It's important to define a "stub" as well. Mox doesn't know what to return for each function and will error when a function is called without having an implementation. &lt;code&gt;Mox.stub_with&lt;/code&gt; will fill those functions with the always-succeeding callbacks we defined in our &lt;code&gt;StubPush&lt;/code&gt; module.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight elixir"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# In test/test_helper.exs&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# This will generate a module named MyApp.Infrastructure.MockPush&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="no"&gt;Mox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;defmock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;MyApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;MockPush&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;for:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;MyApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;PushBehavior&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# This will define all callbacks&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="no"&gt;Mox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;stub_with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;MyApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;MockPush&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;MyApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;StubPush&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="no"&gt;ExUnit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are now ready to start writing the tests for our push notification business logic. To prepare a test module for dealing with mox we need to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add &lt;code&gt;import Mox&lt;/code&gt; so we can use Mox's &lt;code&gt;expect&lt;/code&gt; functions later on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add &lt;code&gt;setup :verify_on_exit!&lt;/code&gt; which will perform some checks about your mocks after a test has run.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight elixir"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;defmodule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;MyApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;PushTest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;ExUnit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;async:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 1. Import Mox&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;Mox&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 2. setup fixtures&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;setup&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:verify_on_exit!&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Here go your tests...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In our tests we want to assert two main things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are our &lt;code&gt;send_push&lt;/code&gt; functions called with the right parameters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does our application handle errors returned from &lt;code&gt;send_push&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to do this we have to overwrite our stub behavior with a function specific to said test case. Mox provides the &lt;code&gt;expect&lt;/code&gt; function for this, which we imported earlier. &lt;code&gt;expect&lt;/code&gt; changes the function body for that specific test. Other tests will still use the stubbed behavior. Let's start with asserting whether the right parameters were given to &lt;code&gt;send_push&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dashbit.co/blog/mocks-and-explicit-contracts"&gt;There's a cool blog-post by José Valim detailing the decisions that lead to the design of Mox. I'd recommend reading it if you want to dive a bit deeper.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When verifying parameters, you usually want to depend on pattern matching in Mox's case. With the pin operator (&lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;) we can verify whether &lt;code&gt;send_push&lt;/code&gt; was called with the same &lt;code&gt;user&lt;/code&gt; as we passed into &lt;code&gt;do_something_that_sends_push&lt;/code&gt;. Mox will ensure that your test fails when an &lt;code&gt;expect&lt;/code&gt; is never called or when there is no matching function clause.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight elixir"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Succesfully sends push notification to right user"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Tip: ExMachina is a great library that helps generate entities like this.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;insert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="no"&gt;MyApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;MockPush&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Check if the user on `send_push` is the same user as we passed thru our call below&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# If the user does not match, this will throw a MatchError&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:send_push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;^&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:ok&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="no"&gt;MyApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;do_something_that_sends_push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can also use &lt;code&gt;expect&lt;/code&gt; to return an error for &lt;code&gt;send_push&lt;/code&gt; and check whether our business logic handles this properly. Let's say we want our &lt;code&gt;do_something_that_sends_push&lt;/code&gt; function to propagate the push error to its caller, its test will look something like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight elixir"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Succesfully propagates errors from push service"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Tip: ExMachina is a great library that helps generate entities like this.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;insert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="no"&gt;MyApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;MockPush&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Check if the user on `send_push` is the same user as we passed thru our call below&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# If the user does not match, this will throw a MatchError&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:send_push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"This user does not have push enabled"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="n"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;MyApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;do_something_that_sends_push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"This user does not have push enabled"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tying-it-all-together"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tying it all together
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tests won't succeed yet. There is one last step before we can successfully try out our test and debug push implementations. We need to tell our application which implementation of our Push behavior it needs to call in certain environments. To do this we are going to use the &lt;code&gt;Application&lt;/code&gt; module which comes with Elixir, and the config files automatically generated in your Elixir project:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight elixir"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# In config/dev.exs we use our push notification logger&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:my_app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:push_api&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;MyApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;DebugPush&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# In config/test.exs we use our Mock as named in Mox.defmock&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:my_app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:push_api&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;MyApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;MockPush&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# In config/prod.exs we want to use our Firebase client&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:my_app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:push_api&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;MyApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;FirebasePush&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now in any case where you need to send a push notification, you should get the currently configured push implementation from the Application's environment before you call it. You can wrap this in a module if you use the implementation a lot.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight elixir"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# individually&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="no"&gt;Application&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:my_app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:push_api&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;send_push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"title"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# wrapped in a module&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;defmodule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;MyApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Push&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;send_push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="no"&gt;Application&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:my_app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:push_api&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;send_push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can now call &lt;code&gt;MyApp.Infrastructure.Push.send_push&lt;/code&gt;, which will look up the PushBehaviour implementation in your Application's environment and call the defined module. Try it out by running &lt;code&gt;iex -S mix&lt;/code&gt; and calling the function. For your dev environment it will log a message to the console!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#in-conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  In conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defining a behaviour and different implementations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are useful when debugging your app's business logic without having to depend on a third party service on your local machine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can be used to stub your calls to third party vendors, preventing you from calling them hundreds of times during tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can be used together with &lt;code&gt;Mox&lt;/code&gt; to assert whether your app behaves correctly with different responses from your third party vendors' APIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
