      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overview:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
To thrive in this rapidly changing &amp;amp; globally competitive environment, businesses have no option but to be agile, resilient &amp;amp; innovative. This calls for digitalization of the processes which has been accelerated by COVID-19 &amp;amp; Industry 4.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key challenge to digitalization is Data Security &amp;amp; Transparency. To address these challenges Blockchain has emerged as a possible antidote to one of today’s most vexing online business challenges — how to create greater trust, transparency and accountability for all who wish to transact and interact online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding Blockchain Technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why use Blockchain?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does it work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the opportunities?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When to use Blockchain?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#origin-and-history-of-blockchain"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Origin and History of Blockchain
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto (An Anonymous person/persons), first generated and implemented the first blockchain database as a infrastructure for the bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency ever created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Satoshi Nakamoto used ‘block’ and ‘chain’ separately in his paper in October 2008&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Later with time, it became a single word ‘blockchain’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From 2014 onward ‘blockchain 2.0’ is the term being referred to new applications of blockchain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#role-of-blockchain"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Role of Blockchain
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry 4.0, the cause of the fusion of physical and the virtual world has come much forward around the type of technology which have come up around advanced robotics, 3D printing, IOT, Artificial intelligence, big data etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are the key technologies around but the problem with this has been now when we talk of technology many of us are using it whether we are using digital I mean robotics part whether we are using data analytics it has improved the convenience speed and efficiency certainly but the key thing which we are suffering in the technology is the time of transit from between the transaction and settlement you have all the best technologies around now-a-days but the time cycle is very long it's more of a linear path then there's a duplication of efforts if you have 40 or 50 players involved in the whole supply chain each one is maintaining his own ledger then which one is the truth nobody knows it and if information is all centralized and the centralized data can be changed around so the trust is gone anybody can hack into the centralized system that's the way they lack the trust and the data security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are moving toward digital era but people are having worrisome the more we become digital anybody can hack our data so the concept of blockchain basically avoid those issues around, this is how the blockchain come if you look in this the technology enablers which have come from industry 4.0 like IOT, robotic process, 3d printing, augmented reality, cloud, AI, cyber security of which we all are aware, but the cyber security is not serving the purpose around in many places so the blockchain which is overriding you can see it's a new way of securing a trust transferring the values and storing the data the new way means it is not centralized information. Today when I am having 50 or 60 people in the whole supply chain and every information if it is particularly dealing with funds is going to the bank if anything else is going to some other servers and those servers are centralized so anybody can hack and change it but the moment the blockchain concepts come it's a more of a distributed concept so it's not a centralized a decentralized database and the moment it is decentralized it's not easy to change so that's how the blockchain is coming into our industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-blockchain-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Blockchain ?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the simplest terms, Blockchain can be described as a data structure that holds transactional records and while ensuring security, transparency, and decentralization. You can also think of it as a chain or records stored in the forms of blocks which are controlled by no single authority. A blockchain is a distributed ledger that is completely open to any and everyone on the network. Once an information is stored on a blockchain, it is extremely difficult to change or alter it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does it mean to be decentralized?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Traditional ledgers are centralized - use 3rd parties and middlemen to approve/record transactions Blockchain distributes ledgers across network or participating node – no central authority required similar to peer-to-peer torrent file sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xhTWC4Rd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/p91r67vot6grfwnot6ro.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xhTWC4Rd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/p91r67vot6grfwnot6ro.png" alt="Image description" width="601" height="319"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-does-it-work"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How does it work?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its core, blockchain brings together an ecosystem of partners who all choose to collaborate to address inefficiency. There are 4 tenants of the technology that everyone needs to understand:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared, Immutable Visibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Privacy&lt;/strong&gt;: Blockchain Technology leverages years of research and 
development in cryptography.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Smart Contracts&lt;/strong&gt;: Blockchain smart contracts are not legal 
documents so don’t think of it that way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Trust/Consensus&lt;/strong&gt;: Here again, Blockchain leverages cryptography. 
When an event is published to the ledger, the algorithms do a 
couple of things. First, the identity of the participant 
publishing the transaction is validated by other participants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blockchain owes its name to the way it stores transaction data – in blocks that are linked together to form a chain. Each block contains a hash &lt;strong&gt;(a digital fingerprint or unique identifier)&lt;/strong&gt;, timestamped batches of recent valid transactions, and the hash of the previous block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9O62xPk9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wzgunz3tj9eiwi986yqx.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9O62xPk9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wzgunz3tj9eiwi986yqx.png" alt="Image description" width="850" height="408"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a nutshell, here’s how blockchain allows transactions to take place:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A blockchain network  makes use of &lt;strong&gt;public and private keys&lt;/strong&gt; so as to make a digital signature ensuring security and consent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once the authentication is ensured through these keys, the necessity for authorization arises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blockchain allows participants of the network to perform mathematical verification and reach a consensus to agree on any particular value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While making a transfer, the sender uses their private key and announces the transaction information over the network. A block is made containing information like digital signature, timestamp, and therefore the receiver’s public key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This block of data is broadcasted through the network and therefore the validation process starts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Miners all over the network start solving the mathematical puzzle related to the transaction in order to process it. Solving this puzzle requires the miners to take a position their computing power.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upon solving the puzzle first, the miner receives rewards within the sort of bitcoins. Such quite problems is mentioned as &lt;strong&gt;proof-of-work&lt;/strong&gt; mathematical problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once the bulk of nodes within the network come to a consensus and comply with a standard solution, the block is time stamped and added to the prevailing blockchain. This block can contain anything from money to data to messages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the new block is added to the chain, the prevailing copies of blockchain are updated for all the nodes on the network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#consensus-mechanism"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Consensus Mechanism
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof Of Work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Proof of work &lt;strong&gt;(PoW)&lt;/strong&gt; describes a system that requires a not-insignificant but feasible amount of effort in order to deter frivolous or malicious uses of computing power, such as sending spam emails or launching denial of service attacks. The concept was subsequently adapted to securing digital money by Hal Finney in 2004 through the idea of "reusable proof of work" using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TP-n_YOY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/onjsbezmo3vejtqo4otr.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TP-n_YOY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/onjsbezmo3vejtqo4otr.jpg" alt="Image description" width="880" height="603"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof Of Stake&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Proof-of-stake &lt;strong&gt;(PoS)&lt;/strong&gt; reduces the amount of computational work needed to verify blocks and transactions that keep the blockchain, and thus a cryptocurrency, secure. Proof-of-stake changes the way blocks are verified using the machines of coin owners. The owners offer their coins as collateral for the chance to validate blocks. Coin owners with staked coins become "validators."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-makes-blockchain-so-lucrative-to-business"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What makes blockchain so lucrative to business?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, it reduces operational costs. The removal of intermediaries may be a boon for business because it not only reduces cost but also reduces the purpose of contact — improving efficiency and growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transactions speeds also are improved to a replacement height. For businesses, it's all about efficiency if they will keep their accuracy intact. The use-cases also are in favor of business. Some companies have already shown their interest in blockchain. The Dubai Blockchain Strategy is one example, The Dubai Blockchain Strategy will help Dubai to be the first city fully powered by Blockchain and make Dubai the happiest city on earth. The strategy will be using three strategic pillars: government efficiency, industry creation, and international leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iAaZj1wS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6qfimolaegkh595v1reh.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iAaZj1wS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6qfimolaegkh595v1reh.png" alt="Image description" width="796" height="681"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-will-blockchain-disrupt-industries"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How Will Blockchain Disrupt Industries?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several industries like Unilever, Walmart, Visa, etc. use blockchain technology and have gained benefits in transparency, security, and traceability. Considering the benefits blockchain offers, it will revolutionize and redefine many sectors. &lt;br&gt;
Here are the top 5 prominent industries that will be disrupted by blockchain technology in the near future:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Banking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cyber Security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supply Chain Management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Healthcare&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Government&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HMHGAVDr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/43n8vjf8i4wi90par24c.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HMHGAVDr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/43n8vjf8i4wi90par24c.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="269"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads us to the end of our article &lt;strong&gt;“Demystifying Blockchain Technology”&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blockchain is undoubtedly important to our society. It’s an impact on the current industries. It is unparalleled. With the growth of BaaS and other improvements, it is the only time when most of the industry will start adopting blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, what do you think about blockchain? Do you see the benefits?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Become a Web Developer in 2022</title>
      <author>Elijah Trillionz</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 09 Jan 2022 16:52:59 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/elijahtrillionz/how-to-become-a-web-developer-in-2022-4cgh</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/elijahtrillionz/how-to-become-a-web-developer-in-2022-4cgh</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, welcome, and in this article am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;how to become a Web Developer in 2022&lt;/strong&gt;. There are numerous companies out there who are ready to pay a large sum of money to have a web developer in their company. You may say in 2022? I say Yes in 2022!. There are also a good number of companies and businesses that require web developers to help create a website that will represent their businesses online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we talk about how to become a web developer, let's quickly look at who a web developer is. If you are ready to sail with me, then let's dive right in&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#who-is-a-web-developer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Who is a Web Developer?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--H8e63E5O--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://webdeverguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Green-and-Monochrome-Photo-Corporate-Website-Facebook-Cover--1024x577.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--H8e63E5O--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://webdeverguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Green-and-Monochrome-Photo-Corporate-Website-Facebook-Cover--1024x577.png" alt="who" width="880" height="496"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A web developer builds World Wide Web applications. In other words, someone who develops or builds websites or web applications is a web developer. The act or process involved in making these websites or web apps is known as Web Development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three kinds of web developers, Front-End Web Developers, Back-End Web Developers, and Full-Stack Web Developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#frontend-web-developers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Front-End Web Developers
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://intellipaat.com/blog/what-is-front-end-developer/#no2"&gt;Front-end web developers&lt;/a&gt; are involved in making the visible parts (interface) of a website or web app (client-side). What visitors of the website or web app see and interact with is built and maintained by a front-end web developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes the beautiful designs, animations, form fields that we see. They can also be called client-side web developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#backend-web-developers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Back-End Web Developers
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/website/back-end-developer"&gt;Back-end web developers&lt;/a&gt; are involved in building the unseen parts of a website or web app (server-side) i.e the server. These guys are lovers of logic, data, technical construction of websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say you fill a form in a web app and then receive a notification that the email is already registered. Now you are thinking, how did this website know my email is registered. Well, a back-end web developer figured it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#fullstack-web-developers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Full-Stack Web Developers
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These guys do both the work of a front-end web developer and that of a back-end web developer; they basically do everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, now you know the three kinds of web developers, I think it's time you decide which one you love most and that one you love most is what you should do. I will be referring to these three guys again, and by then you should have decided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-become-a-web-developer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How To Become a Web Developer?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FQHCE3w0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://webdeverguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Untitled-design-1-1024x591.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FQHCE3w0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://webdeverguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Untitled-design-1-1024x591.png" alt="how" width="880" height="508"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;To become a web developer, there are certain skills or languages that you need to be familiar with. There are languages we use to communicate with computers as web developers and these are the languages you need to learn. There are a lot of languages but you don't need to learn them all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most times, it is at this point a lot of beginners mix essentials with inessentials and tend to miss the right path. By now you should already know what kind of web developer you want to be, and following that path is what matters and that is exactly what we will be doing now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each of the three kinds of web development, I will show you the languages/skills required and those that are optional, I will also recommend the one you should learn how and where to learn it for free or with a paid plan depending on your budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#skillslanguages-to-become-a-frontend-web-developer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Skills/Languages To Become a Front-End Web Developer
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Bootstrap, Tailwind, ReactJS, VueJs, etc. Let\'s analyze where each of them belongs and what they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the above, there are three basic skills to learn that almost the others require you to know before using them. Follow the order below;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-markup-languages"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Markup Languages
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will agree with me that every website or web app has a web page, and every web page contains content (well-structured content). A markup language is what web developers use to structure content on web pages. Simply put, it is what they (web developers) use to display texts, images, buttons, forms, audios, videos to the clients (visitors of the website).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is an example of a Markup Language. HTML is the language I recommend you learn as it is most widely used. HTML5 is the latest release of HTML and a lot of companies are making use of HTML5. So you might wanna learn HTML5 as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where do I learn HTML?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp"&gt;W3Schools has a very concise tutorial on HTML and HTML5 for free&lt;/a&gt;. Check them out. On average, it shouldn't take you more than 3 weeks to learn HTML if you can dedicate at least an hour to studying daily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-stylesheet"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. StyleSheet
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As markup languages display texts, buttons, images, etc, stylesheets style these contents and make them look organized and beautiful, very beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is an example of a StyleSheet and it is what you should learn because it is most widely used and required by companies looking for web developers. CSS3 is the latest release of CSS and lots of websites are making use of its features, it will do you more good if you learn it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where do I learn CSS?&lt;/strong&gt; Again &lt;a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/"&gt;W3Schools has a very concise tutorial on CSS and CSS3 for free.&lt;/a&gt; CSS is very easy to learn, it shouldn\'t take you more than a month if you dedicate 1 hour daily to learning it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-scripting-languages"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Scripting Languages
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interactions, behaviors, etc of web pages are made with scripting languages. For Example, when you click a button on a website and then something pops up. A scripting language basically automates task executions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example is JavaScript. I will confidently recommend you learn JavaScript. It is widely used in all aspects of development i.e Web Development, Mobile Development, Desktop App Development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TypeScript is also a great option to learn along with JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where do I learn JavaScript?&lt;/strong&gt; You can &lt;a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp"&gt;learn JavaScript at W3Schools for free&lt;/a&gt; but sincerely that will not be enough. You will need to go wide and as well as have some daily growth activities to get involved with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people say JavaScript is hard, honestly, that is as a result of the approach they used. I heard someone say He has been on JavaScript for three years. Learning JavaScript for three years? That must be frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't get me wrong though, learning JavaScript never stops. The same way being a student never stops. But this is about the basics, that's terrible in my opinion. So if you use the wrong approach, you may fall victim to depression, confusion, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning JavaScript is tricky but it's not difficult. All you need is to follow the right path and use a good course or tutorial. You may find w3schools difficult to use, so I recommend you use &lt;a href="https://www.codecademy.com"&gt;CodeCademy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CodeCademy gives your projects and exercises to practice with as you learn JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#web-frameworks-amp-libraries"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Web Frameworks &amp;amp; Libraries
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The road-map so far is thus, &lt;strong&gt;HTML =&amp;gt; CSS =&amp;gt; JavaScript&lt;/strong&gt;. Not HTML =&amp;gt; JavaScript =&amp;gt; CSS nor JavaScript =&amp;gt; CSS =&amp;gt; HTML. With the above skills you can build a fully functional static website. Exciting right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the point where you need to build projects with what you've learned. It will help you become better at each of these languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to follow the order. When you are done with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; then you may wanna consider some frameworks and/or libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are numerous &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_framework"&gt;web frameworks&lt;/a&gt; and libraries for CSS and JavaScript out there but have in mind that their primary job is to make coding easier and faster for you. You can learn web frameworks through their documentations for free. Click on any framework or library mentioned below to access their documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#css-frameworks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  CSS Frameworks
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Styling a website can take days, weeks, or even months. But with CSS frameworks the duration becomes lesser and the workload becomes easier. CSS frameworks have already built-in style templates that you just need to tap into your HTML. &lt;a href="https://tailwindcss.com/"&gt;TailwindCSS&lt;/a&gt; is a better and popular option &lt;a href="https://geekflare.com/best-css-frameworks/"&gt;Here is a good list of other CSS frameworks.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#javascript-frameworkslibraries"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  JavaScript Frameworks/Libraries
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Libraries like &lt;a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html"&gt;ReactJs&lt;/a&gt;, or frameworks like &lt;a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/"&gt;VueJs&lt;/a&gt; should what I'd say you consider learning. ReactJS is widely used, so you should consider learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far the road-map is &lt;strong&gt;HTML =&amp;gt; CSS =&amp;gt; JavaScript =&amp;gt; ReactJS&lt;/strong&gt;. With the above skills you can build a fully functional dynamic website (web application).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#skills-to-become-a-backend-web-developer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Skills To Become A Back-End Web Developer
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The languages popularly used for back-end development includes Python, Rust, PHP, Java, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you already know JavaScript, you do not need the languages listed above to become a back-end web developer. Simply learn &lt;a href="https://nodejs.org/en/docs/"&gt;NodeJs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NodeJS is a JavaScript run-time environment that runs JavaScript on your machine rather than the web browser. With NodeJS you can build servers for your website without learning another language other than JavaScript. NodeJs is by far the easiest to learn, with dedicated 1 hr daily to learning; you will complete it in less than two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning NodeJs is not the end, you need to learn some other NodeJS frameworks like &lt;a href="https://expressjs.com"&gt;ExpressJs&lt;/a&gt; or Fastify(&lt;a href="https://www.fastify.io"&gt;https://www.fastify.io&lt;/a&gt;). These frameworks won't take you more than a week to learn the basics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also for the back-end, you need to learn a database language/system. You can either learn SQL or NoSQL or both (though not necessary). I recommend learning NoSQL and an example of NoSQL that you should learn is &lt;a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/"&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to become a back-end web developer this is the roadmap &lt;strong&gt;NodeJS =&amp;gt; ExpressJS/Fastify =&amp;gt; MongoDB/MySQL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#skills-to-become-a-fullstack-web-developer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Skills To Become A Full-Stack Web Developer
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To become a full-stack web developer, you basically need to know everything, and here is everything&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HTML =&amp;gt; CSS =&amp;gt; JavaScript =&amp;gt; ReactJS =&amp;gt; NodeJS =&amp;gt; ExpressJS =&amp;gt; MongoDB/MySQL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CodeCademy offers a &lt;a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path"&gt;premium course&lt;/a&gt; to learn everything listed above and other goodies to become a full-stack web developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-tool-for-you"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A tool for you
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is a tool I made to go along with this article. It provides a roadmap for you who wants to be a web developer. It shows you what you need to learn, and in what order, and where to learn them. The resources there now, is way more than what you find in this article.&lt;br&gt;
So head there, and see for yourself. It's free to use. and it's called &lt;a href="https://devroadmap.vercel.app"&gt;devRoadMap&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also contribute to the resources on &lt;a href="https://github.com/elijah-trillionz/devroadmap"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. I hope to feature more dev roadmap on this website soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choosing between front-end, back-end or both should be based on what you love doing. If you love designing, content structuring; do well to go for front-end dev.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you love logic, data analysis then go for back-end dev. If you love both, then full-stack is for you. Becoming the one you love is what makes programming fun for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, that's it. Thank you for reading, I will see you in the next article. Don\'t forget to hit me up and follow me on Twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elijahtrillionz"&gt;@elijahtrillionz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/codewithsnowbit/how-to-make-http-requests-using-fetch-1hj8</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Hello 👋&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#method-1-promise"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Method 1 - &lt;strong&gt;Promise&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;https://randomuser.me/api/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#method-2-async"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Method 2 - Async
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;https://randomuser.me/api/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Note: Make sure function is &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; *&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>5 Projects to Get You to Your First Web Dev Job in 2022</title>
      <author>Aditya Pradhan</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 09 Jan 2022 16:03:50 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/aditya_developer/5-projects-to-get-you-to-your-first-web-dev-job-in-2022-1gle</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/aditya_developer/5-projects-to-get-you-to-your-first-web-dev-job-in-2022-1gle</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before jumping on to the projects you need to understand and state a clear purpose of your portfolio. So, let's try to understand what you want to achieve with your projects? You are creating portfolio projects to prove your knowledge and skills which can back up what you are saying to the recruiter. In short, showcasing your learnings! Apart from that, if you have any other reasons in your mind it can distract you! For example, your constant urge to make it as refined as possible so that maybe you can create a start-up out of that single project. But my friend things don't work that way! Now, don't get me wrong I'm not saying that you shouldn't create a refined portfolio project. In fact, make it as pleasing as possible but while doing so don't become a perfectionist. Because taking a step is far more important than not doing anything! Always remember version one will be the worst, things will become more and more refined over a period of time! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright so now with a proper mindset let's start talking about the project ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Z1MmwY1J--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641735076263/dU7NoxN4Q.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Z1MmwY1J--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641735076263/dU7NoxN4Q.png" alt="Product landing page" width="880" height="402"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-product-landing-page"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Product landing page
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A beautifully designed product landing page using HTML, CSS, and core JavaScript. In this project, your main focus should be showing your CSS skills. Things like pixel-perfect layout, responsive design, animations,  etc. Spend your time well on this project making sure it stands out. For all the web developers who have a high proficiency over the front end, this is a canvas to show your skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, having a good UI is a bonus, therefore spend a good amount of time doing your design research on websites like Dribbble or Behance. Also, make sure that you are using some good-quality product photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4yxMq_tX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641735155456/nxEfJOg8fZ.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4yxMq_tX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641735155456/nxEfJOg8fZ.png" alt="Task manager" width="880" height="402"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-task-manager"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Task manager
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all the core JavaScript lovers out there, this project is for you! In this project, your main focus should be showing your DOM JavaScript skills. Things like DOM manipulation, using browsers local storage, browsers geolocation API, etc. Although your main focus here is JavaScript try using Scss if you're familiar with it. Remember the goal is to showcase your wide horizon of skills!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decent UI and/or user authentication with Firebase would be big addons to this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DoZXx0yL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641735363110/8jvZFBOeH.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DoZXx0yL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641735363110/8jvZFBOeH.png" alt="Project using API" width="880" height="402"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-project-using-api"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Project using API
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this project, your primary objective should be to show your efficiency in working with network calls and data. Pick up something like React, Angular, or Vue whatever you are comfortable in. If you're confused about the technology, my suggestion would be to go with React (a personal favorite).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For network calls in react you could use Axios and for routing, you can take advantage of react-router-dom. Remember is project is all about showing your skills over a framework and working with APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZP_8aFqJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641735409248/GgJb4MxUF.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZP_8aFqJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641735409248/GgJb4MxUF.jpeg" alt="Ecommerce" width="880" height="402"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-ecommerce"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Ecommerce
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a full-stack web project. We'll talk about technologies a bit later. First, you have to understand the skills that you're trying to show with this project and that is working full-stack both front end as well as back end. Ecommerce would surely cover things like user authentication, profile management, products management, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the tech stack, it would depend on you! If you're a JavaScript developer go with MERN stack or MEAN stack. If you're a python developer go with React as the front end and Django as the back end. Also here database will play a major role!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MSYfP3dm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641735440113/6UOAyoBdh.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MSYfP3dm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641735440113/6UOAyoBdh.png" alt="Social media with chat" width="880" height="402"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-social-media-with-chat"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Social media with chat
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, in the last project you almost showed your efficiency for working with a full-stack web application. But, web development is evolving at a very fast pace therefore, just working with one stack isn't always enough you need to also show that you can integrate your project with third-party services! And that's where a chat app would help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, to create a real-time chat application you would have to use some third-party services. And when we talk about real-time chat services Websockets come into the picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understand is project won't be easy for simple, it will take a huge amount of time maybe 3 to 6 months, but believe me, that would be worth it! There will be times when you'll get frustrated working on this app but if you can pass via that phase you'll have a great project plus experience to show in your resume.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there you have it — five Projects to Get You to Your First Web Dev Job in 2022. While not exhaustive, I hope this post goes some way to help you orient yourself in the ever-changing world of web development and gives you some idea of what to build next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And don’t forget, reading blogs or watching tutorials is great, but there’s no substitution for actually building stuff. Your next employer will be more impressed by an active GitHub account than a list of what you’ve consumed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AWS SAM app with MongoDB Atlas Data APIs</title>
      <author>Jones Zachariah Noel</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 09 Jan 2022 15:39:56 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/zachjonesnoel/aws-sam-app-with-mongodb-atlas-data-apis-18nl</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the implementation of a typical web app backend where the MongoDB Atlas is leveraged to store data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#overview-of-my-submission"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Overview of My Submission
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SAM app uses MongoDB Atlas for database choice which contains two collections - &lt;code&gt;shield_agents&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;shield_locations&lt;/code&gt;. This stores the S.H.I.E.L.D info such as the database of all agents and non classified locations. The operation of &lt;code&gt;INSERT&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; is integrated with &lt;a href="https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/api/data-api/"&gt;MongoDB Atlas Data APIs&lt;/a&gt; where the API credentials are created and passed into AWS Lambda fns as &lt;em&gt;environment variables&lt;/em&gt; with CloudFormation Parameters. The APIs from SAM app are exposed with &lt;em&gt;AWS API Gateway&lt;/em&gt;. Also have the Search enabled with indexes.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose Your Own Adventure&lt;/strong&gt;, the first time I'm using MongoDB and Data APIs so went a step to adapt it into my usual tech-stack (AWS Serverless) with a &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/"&gt;AWS SAM application&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a repository which uses MongoDB Atlas Data APIs for CRUD operations with AWS SAM application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Deployment commands&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a new directory, navigate to that directory in a terminal and clone the GitHub repository&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell position-relative overflow-auto js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;git clone https://github.com/zachjonesnoel/shield-database&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change directory to the pattern directory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell position-relative overflow-auto js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; shield&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the command line, use AWS SAM to deploy the AWS resources for the pattern as specified in the template.yml file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell position-relative overflow-auto js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;sam build
sam deploy --guided&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>React &amp; PDF Rendering</title>
      <author>Damian Piwowarczyk</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 09 Jan 2022 15:35:03 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/przpiw/react-pdf-rendering-4g7b</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/przpiw/react-pdf-rendering-4g7b</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portable Document Format (PDF)&lt;/strong&gt; - developed 30 years ago still exists and is one of the most widely-used documents formats. There are many reasons why people still prefer to use them such as the widely supported document format which works is compatible with many devices and apps, and the content always remains the same format.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-reactpdf-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is React-PDF ?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React-pdf lets us render documents on server and web.&lt;br&gt;
It exports a set of React primitives that can be used to render things into documents easily and we can use CSS properties for styling and flexbox for layout. A list of supported primitives can be found &lt;a href="https://react-pdf.org/components"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; It supports rendering text, images, SVGs and many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-we-going-to-build-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What we going to build ?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we will be looking at how we can create and style PDF with react-pdf renderer. React-pdf package lets us create awesome looking PDFs using React. Its simple to use and the documentation is developer-friendly. We will create a simple application that dynamically updates our PDF-styled template which we render in DOM. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This example will show how you can render the document in DOM and how directly save the document into the file without the need of displaying it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ngvoTeb7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vvr35htmnh72zivmsmvf.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ngvoTeb7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vvr35htmnh72zivmsmvf.png" alt="Demo" width="880" height="461"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-setup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Setup
&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx create-react-app app &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;app &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; yarn add @react-pdf/renderer
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As in the time of writing tutorial react-pdf render is compatible with webpack &amp;gt; 5 however, latest react create app using webpack 6. We will need to install some extra dependencies and configure craco.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn add process browserify-zlib stream-browserify util buffer assert @craco/craco
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Change the scripts section in package.json as below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"scripts"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"start"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"craco start"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"build"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"craco build"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"test"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"craco test"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"eject"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"react-scripts eject"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, create a new file in the root of the project &lt;br&gt;
craco.config.js with&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;webpack&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;webpack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;webpack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;configure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;fallback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;process/browser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Preview&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;profile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;profile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Preview.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This will let us render a preview on half of the page and embed the Template document that we are about to create.&lt;br&gt;
We also have PDFDownloadLink which can be used to  download pdf without the need of rendering it in the DOM.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PDFViewer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PDFDownloadLink&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@react-pdf/renderer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;LeftSection&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;./LeftSection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;RightSection&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;./RightSection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/PDFDownloadLink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;

&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Create Document Component&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Template&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;profile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Page&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;A4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;styles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// We will divide our document into 2 columns&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;LeftSection&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;profile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;profile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;

&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Preview&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We will also create folder with styles where we will keep stylesSheet for react-render primitives.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;mkdir &lt;/span&gt;styles &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;styles &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;mkdir &lt;/span&gt;index.js
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;styles&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;StyleSheet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@react-pdf/renderer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;StyleSheet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="na"&gt;profession_text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;#d1d5db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;fontSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;11px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;profile_img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;60px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;60px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;borderRadius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;90&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;profile_line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;marginTop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;10%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;1px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;backgroundColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;#FFF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;textAlign&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;LeftSection.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Image&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@react-pdf/renderer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;styles&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;../styles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;View&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;styles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;profile_container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;View&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;styles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name_text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;profile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;

&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;View&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;styles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;profile_line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;LeftSection&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;profile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;View&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;styles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;section_left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Profile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;profile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;profile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;LeftSection&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;RightSection.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;styles&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;../styles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@react-pdf/renderer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;RightSection&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;about&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;View&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;styles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;section_right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;about&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now you know it works you could create something yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More functional example of a resume builder that I built is here.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://pdfr-esume-builder.vercel.app"&gt;Resume builder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum up, this is only a simple demo to demonstrate how the pdf renderer can be used with react. React pdf package very cool tool that could be used to create things like resume builders, invoicing templates or tickets or receipts, etc. These could be either generated based on the existing data or dynamically updated on user input like in the case of our simple demo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this article was helpful to some of you guys. Thanks for reading!&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Make SVG follow cursor using CSS and JS</title>
      <author>anomaly3108</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/anomaly3108/make-svg-follow-cursor-using-css-and-js-2okp</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article, we are going to make an SVG Eye that will follow the mouse pointer with a clean UI and smooth transition. First, As always let's see what are we building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#preview"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  PREVIEW
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mQmOeZ78--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4ccgl9mpy95eryjuax67.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mQmOeZ78--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4ccgl9mpy95eryjuax67.gif" alt="Image description" width="572" height="578"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#html"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  HTML
&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img src="face-with-rolling-eyes.png" class="image"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;div class="container"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;svg width="100" height="100" class="eye"&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;circle cx="50" cy="50" r="50" fill="white" class="eyeball_left" /&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;circle cx="50" cy="50" r="20" fill="#0D0D20" class="pupil_left" /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/svg&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;svg width="100" height="100" class="eye"&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;circle cx="50" cy="50" r="50" fill="white" class="eyeball_right" /&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;circle cx="50" cy="50" r="20" fill="#0D0D20" class="pupil_right" /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/svg&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We will have an outer div with class &lt;code&gt;.container&lt;/code&gt;. It will have two separate children SVG which will be the eyes of our character.&lt;br&gt;
Inside SVG we create 2 circles one for eyeball and one for pupil.&lt;br&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;img&lt;/code&gt; tag will be the face of the character&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess now you have an overview of what are we doing. Now let's get into the CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#css"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  CSS
&lt;/h1&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;body{
    margin:0;
    padding:0;
    background: #282631;
    display: flex;
    width: 100%;
    height:100vh;
  }
  .container{
    margin: auto;
  }
  .image{
    position: absolute;
    top: 250px;
    left: 620px;
    z-index: -1;
  }
  .pupil_left{
    position:relative;
  }
  .pupil_right{
    position:relative;
  }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Everything above is self-explanatory but If you have any queries then comment down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#javascript"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  JAVASCRIPT
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the fun begins. Let's see from the scratch.&lt;br&gt;
First, we need to find elements with an "&lt;code&gt;eyeball_left&lt;/code&gt;" and "&lt;code&gt;pupil_left&lt;/code&gt;" class&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    let eyeball_left = document.querySelector(".eyeball_left"),
    pupil_left = document.querySelector(".pupil_left"),

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, We will get the radius of the circles to find the center of the circles. The &lt;code&gt;getBoundingClientRect&lt;/code&gt; returns a DOMRect object with eight properties: left, top, right, bottom, x, y, width, height.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    eyeArea_left = eyeball_left.getBoundingClientRect(),
    pupil_leftArea = pupil_left.getBoundingClientRect(),
    R_left = eyeArea_left.width/2,
    r_left = pupil_leftArea.width/2,
    centerX_left = eyeArea_left.left + R_left,
    centerY_left = eyeArea_left.top + R_left;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Copy the same code for right eye. Just change the variable names to &lt;code&gt;###_right&lt;/code&gt; for right Eye.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    let eyeball_right = document.querySelector(".eyeball_right"),
    pupil_right = document.querySelector(".pupil_right"),
    eyeArea_right = eyeball_right.getBoundingClientRect(),
    pupil_rightArea = pupil_right.getBoundingClientRect(),
    R_right = eyeArea_right.width/2,
    r_right = pupil_rightArea.width/2,
    centerX_right = eyeArea_right.left + R_right,
    centerY_right = eyeArea_right.top + R_right;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, let us create a mouse event. Through which, we will find the distance between the pointer and center of the eyeball. &lt;code&gt;Math.atan2&lt;/code&gt; will return the angle in radians between the two points. By using the formula, we can convert radian to degree.&lt;br&gt;
Using this angle we will position the pupil inside the eyeball&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;document.addEventListener("mousemove", (e)=&amp;gt;{
  let x_left = e.clientX - centerX_left,
      y_left = e.clientY - centerY_left,
      theta_left = Math.atan2(y_left,x_left),
      angle_left = theta_left*180/Math.PI + 360;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Create a same for the right eye&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  let x_right = e.clientX - centerX_right,
      y_right = e.clientY - centerY_right,
      theta_right = Math.atan2(y_right,x_right),
      angle_right = theta_right*180/Math.PI + 360;



&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, we will use JS style property to move and rotate the pupil inside the Eye to follow the cursor&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  pupil_left.style.transform = `translateX(${R_left - r_left +"px"}) rotate(${angle_left + "deg"})`;
  pupil_left.style.transformOrigin = `${r_left +"px"} center`;

  pupil_right.style.transform = `translateX(${R_right - r_right +"px"}) rotate(${angle_right + "deg"})`;
  pupil_right.style.transformOrigin = `${r_right +"px"} center`;

});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now we have covered all the aspects of this now let's see the full Javascript code.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;
    let eyeball_left = document.querySelector(".eyeball_left"),
    pupil_left = document.querySelector(".pupil_left"),
    eyeArea_left = eyeball_left.getBoundingClientRect(),
    pupil_leftArea = pupil_left.getBoundingClientRect(),
    R_left = eyeArea_left.width/2,
    r_left = pupil_leftArea.width/2,
    centerX_left = eyeArea_left.left + R_left,
    centerY_left = eyeArea_left.top + R_left;

    let eyeball_right = document.querySelector(".eyeball_right"),
    pupil_right = document.querySelector(".pupil_right"),
    eyeArea_right = eyeball_right.getBoundingClientRect(),
    pupil_rightArea = pupil_right.getBoundingClientRect(),
    R_right = eyeArea_right.width/2,
    r_right = pupil_rightArea.width/2,
    centerX_right = eyeArea_right.left + R_right,
    centerY_right = eyeArea_right.top + R_right;

document.addEventListener("mousemove", (e)=&amp;gt;{
  let x_left = e.clientX - centerX_left,
      y_left = e.clientY - centerY_left,
      theta_left = Math.atan2(y_left,x_left),
      angle_left = theta_left*180/Math.PI + 360;

  let x_right = e.clientX - centerX_right,
      y_right = e.clientY - centerY_right,
      theta_right = Math.atan2(y_right,x_right),
      angle_right = theta_right*180/Math.PI + 360;


  pupil_left.style.transform = `translateX(${R_left - r_left +"px"}) rotate(${angle_left + "deg"})`;
  pupil_left.style.transformOrigin = `${r_left +"px"} center`;

  pupil_right.style.transform = `translateX(${R_right - r_right +"px"}) rotate(${angle_right + "deg"})`;
  pupil_right.style.transformOrigin = `${r_right +"px"} center`;

});
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The final product will look like:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--59MAYVFL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g4a59uhad9nigc6gz9nf.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--59MAYVFL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g4a59uhad9nigc6gz9nf.gif" alt="Image description" width="572" height="578"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use the following CSS in &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; selector to change the cursor by any image&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;cursor: url("heart.png"), auto;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/devdefinitive/30-javascript-libraries-to-use-in-your-projects-1gd3</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;JavaScript is a programming language that is vastly used in the world both on the client-side as well as server-side that allows you to make web pages convertible and create dynamic web content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a scripting language pre-owned by developers to unveil interactive user interfaces that set forth dynamic content. While CSS and HTML are the languages that give design and proper shape to the web pages. There are a large number of other programming languages out there, including HTML, CSS and Python, but JS is the most commonly used scripting language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, JavaScript offers numerous JS libraries which have created an ecosystem in which coders are not supposed to write code from the scratch, However, these libraries allowing websites to be built quickly with ease. Here In this Article, I've compiled a list of the top 30 JavaScript libraries that every developer must have and can put into use easily for their projects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Context in Go</title>
      <author>Dmytro Krasun</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 09 Jan 2022 14:08:57 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/krasun/context-in-go-1b8a</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Go is a very pragmatic language. If there is a thing in the Go standard library, there is an actual practical reason for it. The same stays valid for &lt;a href="https://pkg.go.dev/context"&gt;Context&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#for-impatient"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  for impatient
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#use-to-specify-a-deadline-timeout-or-cancel-the-running-goroutine"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  use to specify a deadline, timeout, or cancel the running goroutine
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;Context&lt;/code&gt; when you need: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to run a function with time limation, use &lt;a href="https://pkg.go.dev/context#WithDeadline"&gt;Context.WithDeadline()&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://pkg.go.dev/context#WithTimeout"&gt;Context.WithTimeout()&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to be able to cancel running function &lt;a href="https://pkg.go.dev/context#WithCancel"&gt;Context.WithCancel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#use-for-sharing-requestscoped-values"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  use for sharing request-scoped values
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;Context&lt;/code&gt; if you need to share request-scoped values across API boundaries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A trace id can be used for tracing operations between microservices. You can receive it in the HTTP request as a header and then pass it to other functions using context, and if the functions perform calls to other microservices, they can extract the trace id and pass it further. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#for-curious"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  for curious
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#channels-and-goroutines"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  channels and goroutines
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick reminder that Go is famous for implementing &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes"&gt;CSP&lt;/a&gt; with channels and goroutines. You write functions, run them concurrently with the &lt;code&gt;go&lt;/code&gt; command, and communicate with channels. &lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/rENiXEveMs8"&gt;It is that simple&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight go"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;"fmt"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;"time"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;numbers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;make&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;chan&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;results&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;make&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;chan&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;ticker&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NewTicker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Second&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;timer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NewTimer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Second&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;go&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;compute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;numbers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ticker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;fmt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Printf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"number: %d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;numbers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;fmt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Printf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"total sum: %d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;timer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;fmt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"the time went out for a walk"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;compute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;numbers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;chan&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;results&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;chan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;numbers&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;results&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can run thousands of goroutines and build applications with complex communication patterns by combining channels and goroutines. But always profile your solution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that's what happened, but again and again, the same problem arose in a lot of different places. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then you want to specify a timeout, deadline, or to be able to cancel the running goroutine at any time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-pattern-is-extracted-into-the-standard-library"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  the pattern is extracted into the standard library
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not exactly, but I assume that's how &lt;code&gt;Context&lt;/code&gt; emerged. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sajma"&gt;Sameer Ajmani&lt;/a&gt; wrote &lt;a href="https://go.dev/blog/context"&gt;a blog post about the Context pattern&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Go servers, each incoming request is handled in its own goroutine. Request handlers often start additional goroutines to access backends such as databases and RPC services. The set of goroutines working on a request typically needs access to request-specific values such as the identity of the end user, authorization tokens, and the request’s deadline. When a request is canceled or times out, all the goroutines working on that request should exit quickly so the system can reclaim any resources they are using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Google, we developed a context package that makes it easy to pass request-scoped values, cancellation signals, and deadlines across API boundaries to all the goroutines involved in handling a request. The package is publicly available as context. This article describes how to use the package and provides a complete working example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#one-critical-example-from-the-standard-library"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  one critical example from the standard library
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go's standard HTTP client does not require you to specify the context when performing GET requests:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;response, err := http.Get("https://...")
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, you can forget to specify timeout and then &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@nate510/don-t-use-go-s-default-http-client-4804cb19f779"&gt;"don’t use Go’s default HTTP client (in production)"&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But from Go 1.17 you can specify the timeout on the per-request basis:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hardly encourage you always specify the timeout for HTTP requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#further-readings-and-have-a-nice-day"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  further readings and have a nice day 👋
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend you to follow the following links and carefully read them: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://go.dev/blog/context"&gt;original story of the context package&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sajma"&gt;Sameer Ajmani&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ollie writes about &lt;a href="https://goatspeed.substack.com/p/putting-context-into-context"&gt;putting "Context" into context&lt;/a&gt; with providing good examples of how to support contexts in your functions. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2019/09/context-package-semantics-in-go.html"&gt;Context Package Semantics In Go&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/goinggodotnet"&gt;William Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; provides good point on tracing by using context. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://pkg.go.dev/context"&gt;The documentation of the Context package&lt;/a&gt; itself is a good starting point to dive deeper. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least I summarized it for myself, but I am also happy to clarify the context package to you.  Have a nice day 👋&lt;/p&gt;
