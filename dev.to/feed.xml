Each article covers the detailed guide on how to work with particular topic/category . This series aims at providing "A Getting Started Guide on Different aws topics / categories ."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aws-machine-learning-services"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AWS Machine Learning Services
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Using AWS, customers can instantly extract text and data from virtually any document, such as loan applications and medical forms, without manual effort.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sagemaker"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  SageMaker
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--V-YXppNW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c7tgpvim9ms3gt12tjyo.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--V-YXppNW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c7tgpvim9ms3gt12tjyo.png" alt="image" width="133" height="134"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;SageMaker is a fully-managed platform that enables developers and data scientists to quickly and easily build, train, and deploy machine learning models at any scale. SageMaker removes all the barriers that typically slow down developers who want to use machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Machine learning often feels a lot harder than it should be to most developers because the process to build and train models, and then deploy them into production is too complicated and too slow. First, you need to collect and prepare your training data to discover which elements of your data set are important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, you need to select which algorithm and framework you’ll use. After deciding on your approach, you need to teach the model how to make predictions by training, which requires a lot of compute. Then, you need to tune the model so it delivers the best possible predictions, which is often a tedious and manual effort. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After you’ve developed a fully trained model, you need to integrate the model with your application and deploy this application on infrastructure that will scale. All of this takes a lot of specialized expertise, access to large amounts of compute and storage, and a lot of time to experiment and optimize every part of the process. In the end, it's not a surprise that the whole thing feels out of reach for most developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;SageMaker removes the complexity that holds back developer success with each of these steps. SageMaker includes modules that can be used together or independently to build, train, and deploy your machine learning models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sagemaker-ground-truth"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  SageMaker Ground Truth
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BNifetzv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5u7ra2g1j7kk7xpiawwd.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BNifetzv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5u7ra2g1j7kk7xpiawwd.png" alt="image" width="138" height="139"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;SageMaker Ground Truth helps you build highly accurate training datasets for machine learning quickly. SageMaker Ground Truth offers easy access to public and private human labelers and provides them with built-in workflows and interfaces for common labeling tasks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, SageMaker Ground Truth can lower your labeling costs by up to 70% using automatic labeling, which works by training Ground Truth from data labeled by humans so that the service learns to label data independently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Successful machine learning models are built on the shoulders of large volumes of high-quality training data. But, the process to create the training data necessary to build these models is often expensive, complicated, and time-consuming. The majority of models created today require a human to manually label data in a way that allows the model to learn how to make correct decisions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, building a computer vision system that is reliable enough to identify objects - such as traffic lights, stop signs, and pedestrians - requires thousands of hours of video recordings that consist of hundreds of millions of video frames. Each one of these frames needs all of the important elements like the road, other cars, and signage to be labeled by a human before any work can begin on the model you want to develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth significantly reduces the time and effort required to create datasets for training to reduce costs. These savings are achieved by using machine learning to automatically label data. The model is able to get progressively better over time by continuously learning from labels created by human labelers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where the labeling model has high confidence in its results based on what it has learned so far, it will automatically apply labels to the raw data. Where the labeling model has lower confidence in its results, it will pass the data to humans to do the labeling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human-generated labels are provided back to the labeling model for it to learn from and improve. Over time, SageMaker Ground Truth can label more and more data automatically and substantially speed up the creation of training datasets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#amazon-comprehend"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Amazon Comprehend
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sYzaNuIS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uspyi1v6h346errzrck7.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sYzaNuIS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uspyi1v6h346errzrck7.png" alt="image" width="140" height="141"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon Comprehend is a natural language processing (NLP) service that uses machine learning to find insights and relationships in text. No machine learning experience required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a treasure trove of potential sitting in your unstructured data. Customer emails, support tickets, product reviews, social media, even advertising copy represents insights into customer sentiment that can be put to work for your business. The question is how to get at it? As it turns out, Machine learning is particularly good at accurately identifying specific items of interest inside vast swathes of text (such as finding company names in analyst reports), and can learn the sentiment hidden inside language (identifying negative reviews, or positive customer interactions with customer service agents), at almost limitless scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon Comprehend uses machine learning to help you uncover the insights and relationships in your unstructured data. The service identifies the language of the text; extracts key phrases, places, people, brands, or events; understands how positive or negative the text is; analyzes text using tokenization and parts of speech; and automatically organizes a collection of text files by topic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also use AutoML capabilities in Amazon Comprehend to build a custom set of entities or text classification models that are tailored uniquely to your organization’s needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For extracting complex medical information from unstructured text, you can use Amazon Comprehend Medical. The service can identify medical information, such as medical conditions, medications, dosages, strengths, and frequencies from a variety of sources like doctor’s notes, clinical trial reports, and patient health records. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon Comprehend Medical also identifies the relationship among the extracted medication and test, treatment and procedure information for easier analysis. For example, the service identifies a particular dosage, strength, and frequency related to a specific medication from unstructured clinical notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#amazon-lex"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Amazon Lex
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--728IKWGD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/k3x5ye021m3wzo31v9lt.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--728IKWGD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/k3x5ye021m3wzo31v9lt.png" alt="image" width="140" height="141"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon Lex is a service for building conversational interfaces into any application using voice and text. Lex provides the advanced deep learning functionalities of automatic speech recognition (ASR) for converting speech to text, and natural language understanding (NLU) to recognize the intent of the text, to enable you to build applications with highly engaging user experiences and lifelike conversational interactions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Amazon Lex, the same deep learning technologies that power Amazon Alexa are now available to any developer, enabling you to quickly and easily build sophisticated, natural language, conversational bots (“chatbots”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speech recognition and natural language understanding are some of the most challenging problems to solve in computer science, requiring sophisticated deep learning algorithms to be trained on massive amounts of data and infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon Lex democratizes these deep learning technologies by putting the power of Alexa within reach of all developers. Harnessing these technologies, Amazon Lex enables you to define entirely new categories of products made possible through conversational interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#amazon-polly"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Amazon Polly
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vDQ8La5P--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x5d4e97r0unoj9mvppl1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vDQ8La5P--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x5d4e97r0unoj9mvppl1.png" alt="image" width="133" height="134"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon Polly is a service that turns text into lifelike speech. Polly lets you create applications that talk, enabling you to build entirely new categories of speech-enabled products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polly is an Amazon artificial intelligence (AI) service that uses advanced deep learning technologies to synthesize speech that sounds like a human voice. Polly includes 47 lifelike voices spread across 24 languages, so you can select the ideal voice and build speech-enabled applications that work in many different countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon Polly delivers the consistently fast response times required to support real-time, interactive dialog. You can cache and save Polly’s speech audio to replay offline or redistribute. And Polly is easy to use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You simply send the text you want converted into speech to the Polly API, and Polly immediately returns the audio stream to your application so your application can play it directly or store it in a standard audio file format, such as MP3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Polly, you only pay for the number of characters you convert to speech, and you can save and replay Polly’s generated speech. Polly’s low cost per character converted, and lack of restrictions on storage and reuse of voice output, make it a cost-effective way to enable Text-to-Speech everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#amazon-rekognition"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Amazon Rekognition
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UHpzbzDx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ppjzk80dgkiq0095itw2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UHpzbzDx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ppjzk80dgkiq0095itw2.png" alt="image" width="134" height="134"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon Rekognition is a service that makes it easy to add image analysis to your applications. With Rekognition, you can detect objects, scenes, and faces in images. You can also search and compare faces. The Amazon Rekognition API enables you to quickly add sophisticated deep-learning-based visual search and image classification to your applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon Rekognition is based on the same proven, highly scalable, deep learning technology developed by Amazon’s computer vision scientists to analyze billions of images daily for Prime Photos. Amazon Rekognition uses deep neural network models to detect and label thousands of objects and scenes in your images, and we are continually adding new labels and facial recognition features to the service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Amazon Rekognition API lets you easily build powerful visual search and discovery into your applications. With Amazon Rekognition, you only pay for the images you analyze and the face metadata you store. There are no minimum fees, and there are no upfront commitments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#amazon-translate"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Amazon Translate
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZwiLdf42--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0shi3f5g3p2anppo7mkf.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZwiLdf42--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0shi3f5g3p2anppo7mkf.png" alt="image" width="138" height="139"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon Translate is a neural machine translation service that delivers fast, high-quality, and affordable language translation. Neural machine translation is a form of language translation automation that uses deep learning models to deliver more accurate and more natural sounding translation than traditional statistical and rule-based translation algorithms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon Translate allows you to localize content - such as websites and applications - for international users, and to easily translate large volumes of text efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#amazon-transcribe"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Amazon Transcribe
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Z7zK_KLw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/s4rwezftk5qttgigy8mq.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Z7zK_KLw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/s4rwezftk5qttgigy8mq.png" alt="image" width="143" height="143"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon Transcribe is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) service that makes it easy for developers to add speech-to-text capability to their applications. Using the Amazon Transcribe API, you can analyze audio files stored in Amazon S3 and have the service return a text file of the transcribed speech. You can also send a live audio stream to Amazon Transcribe and receive a stream of transcripts in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon Transcribe can be used for lots of common applications, including the transcription of customer service calls and generating subtitles on audio and video content. The service can transcribe audio files stored in common formats, like WAV and MP3, with time stamps for every word so that you can easily locate the audio in the original source by searching for the text. Amazon Transcribe is continually learning and improving to keep pace with the evolution of language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#amazon-forecast"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Amazon Forecast
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--q3qWeMrs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bcwse141z84opqp5x9gw.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--q3qWeMrs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bcwse141z84opqp5x9gw.png" alt="image" width="141" height="141"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon Forecast is a fully managed service that uses machine learning to deliver highly accurate forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies today use everything from simple spreadsheets to complex financial planning software to attempt to accurately forecast future business outcomes such as product demand, resource needs, or financial performance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tools build forecasts by looking at a historical series of data, which is called time series data. For example, such tools may try to predict the future sales of a raincoat by looking only at its previous sales data with the underlying assumption that the future is determined by the past. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach can struggle to produce accurate forecasts for large sets of data that have irregular trends. Also, it fails to easily combine data series that change over time (such as price, discounts, web traffic, and number of employees) with relevant independent variables like product features and store locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the same technology used at Amazon.com, Amazon Forecast uses machine learning to combine time series data with additional variables to build forecasts. Amazon Forecast requires no machine learning experience to get started. You only need to provide historical data, plus any additional data that you believe may impact your forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the demand for a particular color of a shirt may change with the seasons and store location. This complex relationship is hard to determine on its own, but machine learning is ideally suited to recognize it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you provide your data, Amazon Forecast will automatically examine it, identify what is meaningful, and produce a forecasting model capable of making predictions that are up to 50% more accurate than looking at time series data alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon Forecast is a fully managed service, so there are no servers to provision, and no machine learning models to build, train, or deploy. You pay only for what you use, and there are no minimum fees and no upfront commitments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#amazon-textract"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Amazon Textract
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--b43Cbexx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h6diu7xchy6pwrge3nux.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--b43Cbexx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h6diu7xchy6pwrge3nux.png" alt="image" width="138" height="139"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon Textract is a service that automatically extracts text and data from scanned documents. Amazon Textract goes beyond simple optical character recognition (OCR) to also identify the contents of fields in forms and information stored in tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many companies today extract data from documents and forms through manual data entry that’s slow and expensive or through simple optical character recognition (OCR) software that is difficult to customize. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rules and workflows for each document and form often need to be hard-coded and updated with each change to the form or when dealing with multiple forms. If the form deviates from the rules, the output is often scrambled and unusable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon Textract overcomes these challenges by using machine learning to instantly “read” virtually any type of document to accurately extract text and data without the need for any manual effort or custom code. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Textract you can quickly automate document workflows, enabling you to process millions of document pages in hours. Once the information is captured, you can take action on it within your business applications to initiate next steps for a loan application or medical claims processing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, you can create smart search indexes, build automated approval workflows, and better maintain compliance with document archival rules by flagging data that may require redaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon Personalize is a machine learning service that makes it easy for developers to create individualized recommendations for customers using their applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Machine learning is being increasingly used to improve customer engagement by powering personalized product and content recommendations, tailored search results, and targeted marketing promotions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, developing the machine-learning capabilities necessary to produce these sophisticated recommendation systems has been beyond the reach of most organizations today due to the complexity of developing machine learning functionality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon Personalize allows developers with no prior machine learning experience to easily build sophisticated personalization capabilities into their applications, using machine learning technology perfected from years of use on Amazon.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Amazon Personalize, you provide an activity stream from your application – page views, signups, purchases, and so forth – as well as an inventory of the items you want to recommend, such as articles, products, videos, or music. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also choose to provide Amazon Personalize with additional demographic information from your users such as age, or geographic location. Amazon Personalize will process and examine the data, identify what is meaningful, select the right algorithms, and train and optimize a personalization model that is customized for your data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All data analyzed by Amazon Personalize is kept private and secure, and only used for your customized recommendations. You can start serving your personalized predictions via a simple API call from inside the virtual private cloud that the service maintains. You pay only for what you use, and there are no minimum fees and no upfront commitments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon Personalize is like having your own Amazon.com machine learning personalization team at your disposal, 24 hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>How to use Svelte Keyed Each Block?</title>
      <author>Saurabh Dashora</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 12:28:08 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/dashsaurabh/how-to-use-svelte-keyed-each-block-pmf</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/dashsaurabh/how-to-use-svelte-keyed-each-block-pmf</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post, we learn how to use &lt;strong&gt;Svelte Keyed Each Block&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the normal  &lt;a href="https://progressivewebninja.com/how-to-use-svelte-each-block-to-render-arrays/"&gt;Svelte Each Block&lt;/a&gt;, we use the &lt;code&gt;each&lt;/code&gt; keyword to render an array or list. While it works perfectly when we have static lists, there is a serious issue when we delete items from the list. We are going to first look at the issue and then come up with the solution to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-svelte-each-block-issue"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1 – Svelte Each Block Issue
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate the issue, we will take the example of displaying books and their respective authors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is our &lt;code&gt;App&lt;/code&gt; component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-appsvelte-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;App.svelte&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Book&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./Book.svelte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;books&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;bookName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Eye of the World&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;bookName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;The Way of Kings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;bookName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;The Name of the Wind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}]&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;books&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;books&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;slice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Welcome&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Fantasy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;each&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;books&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;book&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;idx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;idx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Book&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;bookName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;book&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;bookName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/each&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Remove&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Book&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the above piece of code, we have the &lt;code&gt;books&lt;/code&gt; array with three hard-coded books. We use the &lt;code&gt;each&lt;/code&gt; block to render the &lt;code&gt;books&lt;/code&gt; using the &lt;code&gt;Book&lt;/code&gt; component. Finally, we also have a button to remove the first book from the &lt;code&gt;each&lt;/code&gt; block. When the user clicks the button, we invoke the &lt;code&gt;handleClick()&lt;/code&gt; function that slices the &lt;code&gt;books&lt;/code&gt; array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is the code for the &lt;code&gt;Book&lt;/code&gt; component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-booksvelte-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;Book.svelte&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;authors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Eye of the World&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Robert Jordan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;The Way of Kings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Brandon Sanderson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;The Name of the Wind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Patrick Rothfuss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;bookName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;author&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;authors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;bookName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Book&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;bookName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Author: {author}&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this component, we have the &lt;strong&gt;book&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;author&lt;/strong&gt; map. Based on the input &lt;code&gt;bookName&lt;/code&gt;, we basically determine the name of the author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we run the app now and then click the button to remove first book once, we will see the below output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DfcT4Tvm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://progressivewebninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/svelte-each-block-issue.png.webp" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DfcT4Tvm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://progressivewebninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/svelte-each-block-issue.png.webp" alt="svelte-each-block-issue.png" width="880" height="295"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the &lt;code&gt;bookName&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;authorName&lt;/code&gt; does not match. Though the first book was correctly deleted, the &lt;code&gt;authorName&lt;/code&gt; got mixed up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why does this happen?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason is that when we modify the underlying array of an &lt;code&gt;each&lt;/code&gt; block, Svelte adds and removes items from the end of the block. It also updates any values that have changed. This is the default behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to this, the last item is removed and the items above it are updated. However, the &lt;code&gt;author&lt;/code&gt; value is not updated because it is the local constant of the &lt;code&gt;Book&lt;/code&gt; component. Its value was fixed at the time of component initialization. This leads to the data mismatch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-the-svelte-keyed-each-block"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2 – The Svelte Keyed Each Block
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get around this issue, we need to use &lt;strong&gt;keyed each block&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See below example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-appsvelte-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;App.svelte&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Book&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./Book.svelte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;books&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;bookName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Eye of the World&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;bookName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;The Way of Kings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;bookName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;The Name of the Wind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}]&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;books&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;books&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;slice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Welcome&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Fantasy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;each&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;books&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;book&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;idx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;book&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;idx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Book&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;bookName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;book&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;bookName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/each&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Remove&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Book&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Basically, here we introduce an &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; field in the &lt;code&gt;books&lt;/code&gt; array. Each book has a unique id. In a real life application, this &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; could also be the database id. The point is that it should be unique for every item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also utilise this &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; in the each block as below.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;each&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;books&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;book&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;idx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;book&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Basically, the role of this &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; field is to help Svelte figure out which DOM node should be changed when the &lt;code&gt;each&lt;/code&gt; block updates. After this modification, if we run the application and click the button, we will see proper data as below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, we learn how to use &lt;strong&gt;Svelte Keyed Each Block&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the normal  &lt;a href="https://progressivewebninja.com/how-to-use-svelte-each-block-to-render-arrays/"&gt;Svelte Each Block&lt;/a&gt;, we use the &lt;code&gt;each&lt;/code&gt; keyword to render an array or list. While it works perfectly when we have static lists, there is a serious issue when we delete items from the list. We are going to first look at the issue and then come up with the solution to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-svelte-each-block-issue"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1 – Svelte Each Block Issue
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate the issue, we will take the example of displaying books and their respective authors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is our &lt;code&gt;App&lt;/code&gt; component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-appsvelte-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;App.svelte&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Book&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./Book.svelte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;books&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;bookName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Eye of the World&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;bookName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;The Way of Kings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;bookName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;The Name of the Wind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}]&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;books&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;books&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;slice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Welcome&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Fantasy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;each&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;books&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;book&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;idx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;idx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Book&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;bookName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;book&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;bookName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/each&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Remove&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Book&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the above piece of code, we have the &lt;code&gt;books&lt;/code&gt; array with three hard-coded books. We use the &lt;code&gt;each&lt;/code&gt; block to render the &lt;code&gt;books&lt;/code&gt; using the &lt;code&gt;Book&lt;/code&gt; component. Finally, we also have a button to remove the first book from the &lt;code&gt;each&lt;/code&gt; block. When the user clicks the button, we invoke the &lt;code&gt;handleClick()&lt;/code&gt; function that slices the &lt;code&gt;books&lt;/code&gt; array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is the code for the &lt;code&gt;Book&lt;/code&gt; component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-booksvelte-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;Book.svelte&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;authors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Eye of the World&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Robert Jordan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;The Way of Kings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Brandon Sanderson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;The Name of the Wind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Patrick Rothfuss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;bookName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;author&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;authors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;bookName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Book&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;bookName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Author: {author}&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this component, we have the &lt;strong&gt;book&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;author&lt;/strong&gt; map. Based on the input &lt;code&gt;bookName&lt;/code&gt;, we basically determine the name of the author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we run the app now and then click the button to remove first book once, we will see the below output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--E4gQeHC5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://progressivewebninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/svelte-keyed-each-block-2048x480.png.webp" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--E4gQeHC5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://progressivewebninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/svelte-keyed-each-block-2048x480.png.webp" alt="svelte-each-block-issue.png" width="880" height="206"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the &lt;code&gt;bookName&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;authorName&lt;/code&gt; does not match. Though the first book was correctly deleted, the &lt;code&gt;authorName&lt;/code&gt; got mixed up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why does this happen?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason is that when we modify the underlying array of an &lt;code&gt;each&lt;/code&gt; block, Svelte adds and removes items from the end of the block. It also updates any values that have changed. This is the default behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to this, the last item is removed and the items above it are updated. However, the &lt;code&gt;author&lt;/code&gt; value is not updated because it is the local constant of the &lt;code&gt;Book&lt;/code&gt; component. Its value was fixed at the time of component initialization. This leads to the data mismatch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-the-svelte-keyed-each-block"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2 – The Svelte Keyed Each Block
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get around this issue, we need to use &lt;strong&gt;keyed each block&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See below example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-appsvelte-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;App.svelte&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Book&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./Book.svelte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;bookName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Eye of the World&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;bookName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;The Way of Kings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;bookName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;The Name of the Wind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}]&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;books&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;books&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;slice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Welcome&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Fantasy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;each&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;books&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;book&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;idx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;book&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;idx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Book&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;bookName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;book&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;bookName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/each&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Remove&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Book&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Basically, here we introduce an &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; field in the &lt;code&gt;books&lt;/code&gt; array. Each book has a unique id. In a real life application, this &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; could also be the database id. The point is that it should be unique for every item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also utilise this &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; in the each block as below.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;each&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;books&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;book&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;idx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;book&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Basically, the role of this &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; field is to help Svelte figure out which DOM node should be changed when the &lt;code&gt;each&lt;/code&gt; block updates. After this modification, if we run the application and click the button, we will see proper data as below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wEtOwunZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1642385377572/W9TmhfFzW.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wEtOwunZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1642385377572/W9TmhfFzW.png" alt="svelte-keyed-each-block-fix.png" width="880" height="206"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book name and author name match as expected. The first book was successfully removed. However, Svelte only removed the appropriate DOM node and other nodes were left as they were before the update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this, we have learnt how to use &lt;strong&gt;Svelte Keyed Each Block&lt;/strong&gt;. This is extremely useful when we have a requirement to update elements within our each blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this little post was useful. If you have any comments or queries about this post, please feel free to write them in the comments section below.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Improve Your Developer Onboarding Path With the 10-3-10 Test</title>
      <author>Matthew Revell</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 12:19:07 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/codesee/improve-your-developer-onboarding-path-with-the-10-3-10-test-253j</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/codesee/improve-your-developer-onboarding-path-with-the-10-3-10-test-253j</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Getting to the point is essential for a smooth developer onboarding. Within seconds, you need to answer your product or project's what, why, and how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yGgmRDU9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cscgt7bg628kjqmrtw9u.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yGgmRDU9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cscgt7bg628kjqmrtw9u.jpg" alt="Microscope" width="880" height="583"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it can be hard to put ourselves in the shoes of a developer who knows nothing of what we do. That's why it's essential that we test and improve the onboarding path we give developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to do that is the 10-3-10 test. It's quick to perform, requires no special tools, and pretty much anyone can do it. Here's how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#from-zero-to-hello-world-in-ten-minutes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  From zero to Hello World in ten minutes
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea behind the 10-3-10 test is pretty simple. A developer should land on your site without any context and achieve the Hello World state within 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before a developer can get to that point, they need to know what the product does and then register to get a developer account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within all three of those milestones -- &lt;strong&gt;understanding&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;registration&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;first product use&lt;/strong&gt; -- lurks danger. At each stage, you're asking the developer to give you something on trust. At first, it's their time, then a small amount of information about themselves, and finally, it's both their time and their mental energy. It might sound over the top, but you need to reward the developer for each of those. Get the reward wrong, and the danger becomes apparent: the developer will lose trust and look elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dropoff-is-real"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Drop-off is real
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1835449.1835513"&gt;Work by Microsoft Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that typical web users decide whether to stay or go within 10 seconds of arriving at a web page. There is even &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01449290500330448"&gt;an old study&lt;/a&gt; that suggests web page visitors form an opinion within 50 milliseconds of landing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping someone on the page long enough to explain the offering is just the start, though. &lt;a href="https://heap.io/blog/good-conversion-rate-signup-flow"&gt;Research on conversion rates&lt;/a&gt; by product analytics firm Heap suggests that 63% of SaaS users fail to complete product sign-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are operating in a world of spam, clickbait, unregulated advertising, and other underhanded attempts to grab our attention. People have trained themselves to apply harsh relevance criteria to the information they find on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguably, developers are not typical web users. Whether that makes them more or less patient will depend on their level of motivation, among other factors. What is clear, though, is that you have very little time in which to capture a developer's attention and then turn that into an interest in your product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#three-questions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Three questions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are multiple pressures on your developer onboarding flow. Product marketing might have a particular wording they want you to use. Someone in the growth team wants to try an experiment they read about recently. The VP of Sales is pushing for more data collection to assign new developer sign-ups to the appropriate salesperson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether good or bad, the reality of these demands is that they can lead to a loss of focus. And in most companies, the demand for such change never really stops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 10-3-10 test is simple, repeatable, and quick, helping you measure whether you're continuing to serve developers. It asks three questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10 (understanding):&lt;/strong&gt; Can a developer get a solid idea of what your product does within ten seconds of arriving on a developer-targeted landing page?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;3 (registration):&lt;/strong&gt; Can that person register for a developer account within three minutes of landing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10 (first use):&lt;/strong&gt; Can they get to Hello World ten minutes after first landing on the site? Whether you perform each test informally yourself or set up an ethnographic research session, it's worth diving into some of the factors that influence each stage first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#understanding"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Understanding
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How often have you been to a product website and come away none the wiser about what it does?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competing demands too often lead to product pages that say a lot but communicate nothing. A common scenario is messaging that attempts to address too many different audiences at once. If a vendor compromises its message to serve both developers and, say, procurement managers, it'll serve neither well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, it's just that companies overthink how they talk about their products. As someone writing about a product, it can be hard to extract yourself from the context you have. It's tempting to build every comment, every meeting about the Chief Marketing Officer's vocab preferences, every barb thrown by the competition into that one very clever headline. But does that serve someone who just wants to know what problem your product solves and how?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step to passing the understanding test is to make sure you have a dedicated space to speak primarily to developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, stay specific and tell developers what your product does for them. Consider CodeSee's own home page. The headline and sub-head get straight to the action:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visualize codebases faster&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Map an entire codebase in just a few clicks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short follow-up paragraph then expands on that in a way that sticks entirely to the facts of how the product benefits developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avoid the temptation to over-egg how you describe your offering. "SMS API," rather than "customer engagement solution." That kind of messaging has its place for certain audiences, and it makes product marketers feel good, but for developers, it's just another hurdle in the way of understanding whether that thing solves a problem that they have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To pass the first test, a typical developer should understand the practical purpose of your product within ten seconds of landing on your developer home page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#registration"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Registration
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Registration is a chasm in your developer onboarding. This is where developers must put the most trust in you by providing personal information without a clear idea of the pay-off. Provide them with guide ropes, way finding, and a hint of the reward that is to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, how do you get a developer from the landing page to sign-up? The button or link you provide needs to be immediately obvious, not so wordy that people are tempted to skip it, and yet still communicate what's to come. Oh, and the copy must avoid scaring people off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Get started" and "Start now" are common choices. However, &lt;a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/get-started/"&gt;at least one study&lt;/a&gt; has shown that "Get started" attracts clicks, but not all are from people who are ready to try, download, or buy your product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://miro.com/api/"&gt;The Miro API&lt;/a&gt;'s "Start building" is clearer. Click that, and you know you're about to get hands-on with the API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CodeSee's "Try Maps now" communicates a lot in three words. "Try" tells you that you're going to be hands-on with the product while making it feel casual rather than intimidating. Naming the product enforces what's coming next, and "now" adds a sense that clicking will lead to a fast pay-off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's a lot for a button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The registration process itself must stick to the principle of "minimum viable information". Sales and marketing colleagues might push to capture more and more information during registration, but your primary aim here is not to add another lead to the CRM. Instead, registration is about enabling access and then allowing the rest of the experience and product to win over the developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That doesn't mean you can't ask for more than just an email address and password. Most people have some tolerance for providing extra information. However, you should aim to frame at least some of those additional questions in terms of how they'll benefit the developer. Twilio's registration process is great for this. It asks some questions that might help their sales funnel but also collects information, such as your preferred programming language, that makes the developer dashboard more helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To pass the second test, a typical developer should be able to get a developer account within three minutes of landing on your developer home page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#hello-world"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Hello World
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Providing a smooth path through registration is good, but it's only a staging post. The developer's goal is to see for themselves whether your product solves their problem and whether they like the idea of working with your company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is enormous scope for ways to improve the path to Hello World, so let's focus on one thing. When the developer first logs into your dashboard, take them by the hand through the steps they need to achieve something worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a first use experience is more than flashing up a quick-start guide or a click-through signposting of the dashboard's UI. It is a highly focused path that takes the developer from no knowledge of your product to that Hello World interaction. It builds on the supplemental information you've gathered during sign-up. Are they a Ruby developer? Great, get them to download your SDK's gem. They told you they work for a large company? Suggest they link their new account with Okta or other SSO providers to simplify integration with corporate sign-on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That highly focused first use experience should contain everything the developer needs to get a feel for your solution and what it's like to develop with, in as efficient a way as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a typical developer can get to Hello World within ten minutes of the first landing on your developer pages, you've passed the 10-3-10 test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#and-theres-more"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  And there's more
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 3-10-3 test is a blunt instrument, but it's useful as a way to keep us honest about whether our onboarding serves developers. It works well for commercial products, and there's plenty of scope to adapt it to onboarding a developer onto a team building a product or a developer joining an open source project.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Javascript's reduce method in a nutshell.</title>
      <author>Amine zoldyck</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 11:57:56 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/amiinequ/javascripts-reduce-method-in-a-nutshell-gik</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/amiinequ/javascripts-reduce-method-in-a-nutshell-gik</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The word "reduce" in the English language means :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to diminish in size, amount, extent, or number&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's suppose that we have an array of items&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;const cartItems = [1,3,5,7,9];&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want the sum of all the items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could use the For Loop but it's going to be a bit hairy. The method &lt;code&gt;reduce()&lt;/code&gt; will give us one total number with less code (always go for the less-code option).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;reduce() takes two arguments: a callback function (the reducer itself) and an initial value. The callback function takes two arguments: the previous value and the current value:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;let total = cartItems.reduce((previousValue, currentValue) =&amp;gt; {
    return previousValue + currentValue;
}, 0)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's calculate the first rotation on the array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;previousValue&lt;/code&gt; is going to be equal to 0 while the &lt;code&gt;currentValue&lt;/code&gt; is going to be equal to the first item in the array, which is 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, the &lt;code&gt;previousValue&lt;/code&gt; is going to be equal to 1 while the &lt;code&gt;currentValue&lt;/code&gt; is going to be equal to 3 and so it goes. The total amount will be sum of all the numbers: 25&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: the reverse of the &lt;code&gt;reduce()&lt;/code&gt; method is &lt;code&gt;reduceRight()&lt;/code&gt;. Yes! It takes items from right to left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ladies and gentlemen, that was a quick tutorial of the reduce() method. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't forget to practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/alexsergey/rockpack-20-official-release-5ak9</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;More than a year has passed since the release of version 1.0. During this time, I received feedback from users, made many fixes, and also updated all dependencies to the current state. And today I would like to proudly present you the release of the second version of this tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/AlexSergey/rockpack"&gt;Rockpack repository is here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-rockpack"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Rockpack?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting a new React project, whether it's a small module or a React component, or vice versa, a &lt;strong&gt;large application with SSR support&lt;/strong&gt;, we spend a lot of time solving routine tasks, slowing down the development process. We can’t dive into solving business problems without setting up Webpack, including all plugins and modules, setting up ESLint, Jest, Babel, TypeScript, as well as dependencies and configurations for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--69YoAtH5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.natrube.net/rockpack/readme_assets/rockpack_main_1.v2.0.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--69YoAtH5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.natrube.net/rockpack/readme_assets/rockpack_main_1.v2.0.png" alt="Usual flow" width="880" height="573"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this process can be automated!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rockpack is a tool that can deploy one of the 4 types of React applications on your computer in one console command, which will be described below, with fully configured &lt;strong&gt;Webpack 5&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;ESLint 8&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Babel&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Jest&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;TypeScript&lt;/strong&gt; and more with perfectly optimized settings, for stable and fast work. You not only get the generated settings, but also the basic framework of the project, based on the best development practices and experience of the entire React community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--aVcUb9_j--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.natrube.net/rockpack/readme_assets/rockpack_main_2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--aVcUb9_j--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.natrube.net/rockpack/readme_assets/rockpack_main_2.png" alt="Rockpack flow" width="880" height="641"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rockpack's main goal is to reduce project setup from weeks to 5 minutes!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#whats-new-in-rockpack-20"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What's new in Rockpack 2.0?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the work on Rockpack 2.0, absolutely all dependencies have been updated. Now using the latest version of &lt;strong&gt;Webpack 5&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Typescript 4.5+&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;ESLint 8+&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Jest 27+&lt;/strong&gt;, etc. All modules, plugins, loaders have been updated. Configs have been rewritten, taking into account the features of new versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project supports &lt;strong&gt;React 17+&lt;/strong&gt; versions. It is no longer necessary to import React into every component. Also, the latest React Router 6 is available out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-does-rockpack-support"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What does Rockpack support?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of the box, you can take advantage of the following features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TypeScript support 4.5+&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Babel 7, Babel-preset-env (&amp;gt; 5%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support build nodejs scripts with nodemon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hot Module Replacement for SPA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Livereload for SSR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Source maps and Extended dev mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dotenv support and Dotenv safe support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;React optimizations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monorepo support&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;CSS: CSS/SASS (dart-sass)/LESS + Postcss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Postcss, Autoprefixer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSS Modules support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imagemin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formats support: Markdown, Video, Audio, Fonts, SVG, Script, Shaders etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SVG + SVGO, SVGR (import SVG like React Component)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Antd optimizations (With optimizations: auto replace momentjs to dayjs, import antd)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terser minification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate stats.json (in production mode)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SEO Optimizations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bundle Analyze (webpack-bundle-analyzer, Statoscope)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isomorphic compile support (include isomorphic styles, isomorphic dynamic imports - @loadable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vendor array splitting support (You can set dependency libraries to this array to split it on separate vendor.js file)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MD/MDX support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GraphQL support (webpack-graphql-loader)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Сross-env included&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rockpack comes with a set of the best ESLint rules, Babel plugins and Jest plugins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-do-i-need-rockpack-when-there-is-createreactapp"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why do I need Rockpack when there is create-react-app?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main difference between Rockpack and create-react-app is that you can generate 4 types of applications, including those with SSR support, using best practices and feature-based project structure approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;CSR (Client Side Render)&lt;/strong&gt; is an ordinary Single Page Application that has a project structure &lt;a href="https://dev.to/alexsergey/project-structure-repository-and-folders-review-of-approaches-4kh2"&gt;Project Structure Article&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;SSR (Server Side Render)&lt;/strong&gt; is an application with a configured server to work with Server Side Render support as well as SEO best practices &lt;a href="https://dev.to/alexsergey/server-side-rendering-from-zero-to-hero-2610"&gt;SSR Article&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;React Component&lt;/strong&gt; is a boilerplate for building a React Component. If you need to create a React Component and expose it to NPM, then this option is for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;UMD Library&lt;/strong&gt; - This option is for you if you just need to create and publish to NPM just a library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The SSR project will also have a number of best practices for SEO, which will make it possible to get a project with a high level in the lighthouse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--D7pQ58mP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.natrube.net/rockpack/readme_assets/seo_performance.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--D7pQ58mP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.natrube.net/rockpack/readme_assets/seo_performance.jpg" alt="SEO Performance" width="880" height="308"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-get-started-with-rockpack"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to get started with Rockpack?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's very simple! To start using Rockpack now, you need to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1.&lt;/strong&gt; Install the package globally:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-g&lt;/span&gt; @rockpack/starter
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2.&lt;/strong&gt; Run the command:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;rockpack folder_name
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;for example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;rockpack my-awesome-app
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3.&lt;/strong&gt; Select the required project type from the list&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--n2r1Wi5b--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.natrube.net/rockpack/readme_assets/rockpack_starter_1.v3.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--n2r1Wi5b--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.natrube.net/rockpack/readme_assets/rockpack_starter_1.v3.jpg" alt="Rockpack Starter" width="777" height="105"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to learn more, Rockpack readme is &lt;a href="https://github.com/AlexSergey/rockpack"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#whats-next"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What's next?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rockpack project is over 2 years old. During this time, it has become stable and does not require changes to the main API. We will support the project and expand its functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone who read this article! I hope Rockpack will be handy in your work.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Day 81 of 100 Days of Code &amp; Scrum: Picking Up MySQL AKA Dolphin Database</title>
      <author>Rammina</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 10:31:36 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/rammina/day-81-of-100-days-of-code-scrum-picking-up-mysql-aka-dolphin-database-175k</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/rammina/day-81-of-100-days-of-code-scrum-picking-up-mysql-aka-dolphin-database-175k</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello there, everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was my weekly visit to my physical therapist, so I couldn't do much coding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I built around half of the content for the Writing Services section for my &lt;a href="https://www.rammina.com"&gt;business site&lt;/a&gt;. It should be ready for deployment by tomorrow or the next day. Also, I learned a little bit more Next.js.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to pick up MySQL because I'm going to need it soon. I've been relying too much on MongoDB, which is a noSQL database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#yesterday"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Yesterday
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I set my goals for this week, which are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finishing the Services pages and then deploying them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learning more Next.js and Scrum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pick up either MySQL or Flutter, and I decided to go for the former.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#today"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Today
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#company-website"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Company Website
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;coded around half of the content for the Writing Services section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#nextjs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Next.js
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continued going through &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/"&gt;Next.js &amp;amp; React by Maximilian Schwarzmüller&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learn a little bit more SWR.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#scrum"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Scrum
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn't have the time to read an article about Scrum for today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#mysql"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  MySQL
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I learned some basic concepts in MySQL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading! Have a good day!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Did we just build a Netflix clone with Appwrite?</title>
      <author>Matej Bačo</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 10:17:29 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/appwrite/did-we-just-build-a-netflix-clone-with-appwrite-28ok</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/appwrite/did-we-just-build-a-netflix-clone-with-appwrite-28ok</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  👋 Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IIUyr74i--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/l1qgdzaxva2blpnpfiuw.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IIUyr74i--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/l1qgdzaxva2blpnpfiuw.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the beginning of our 3 part series where we build a fully functional Netflix clone we like to call, Almost Netflix! Almost Netflix is a movie streaming app just like Netflix, but completely open source and built with technologies you love! We'll be using Appwrite to handle all the backend functionality and walk you through the process of creating the frontend in Web, Flutter, Android and iOS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned, as we will be continuing this series in future Appwrite releases and improving our demo step by step. Today's blog post is a setup to prepare you for what's to come tomorrow. 😉 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before jumping into the frontend, we need to prepare an Appwrite instance. This post will guide you through the installation of Appwrite, project setup, database preparation, and data insertion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🤔 What is Appwrite ?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://appwrite.io/"&gt;Appwrite&lt;/a&gt; is open source backend-as-a-service that abstracts all the complexity involved in building a modern application by providing you with a set of REST APIs for your core backend needs. Appwrite handles user authentication and authorization, databases, file storage, cloud functions, webhooks and much more! If there is anything missing, you can extend Appwrite using your favourite backend language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#appwrite-installation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🤖 Appwrite installation
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appwrite runs its services using a Docker infrastructure, so to install Appwrite, we will need Docker up and running on our machine. We will be running this project on a $10 DigitalOcean droplet with the Linux operating system. On Linux, we can installation Docker using the following command:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-fsSL&lt;/span&gt; https://get.docker.com &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-o&lt;/span&gt; get-docker.sh &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; sh get-docker.sh
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can skip this step if you have Docker already installed on your machine. To check that, you can run the &lt;code&gt;docker --version&lt;/code&gt;, and if this command does not fail, you have Docker already installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Docker installed, we can continue to install Appwrite. Installing Appwrite on any platform is as simple as running a single docker command in the terminal or command prompt. The command is tiny-bit different for each platform, so make sure to use the correct one from our &lt;a href="https://appwrite.io/docs/installation"&gt;installation docs&lt;/a&gt;. We are using the operating system Linux, so we use the insulation script:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--rm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--volume&lt;/span&gt; /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--volume&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;pwd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;/appwrite:/usr/src/code/appwrite:rw &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--entrypoint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"install"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    appwrite/appwrite:0.12.0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure you use the latest Appwrite version to access all the cool features we are releasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like that ✨ we now have Appwrite installed on our machine, and when we enter the IP address into our browser, we should see Appwrite's sign-up page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lpoKhQyD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/reoxlux93dp6hq9x8jos.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lpoKhQyD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/reoxlux93dp6hq9x8jos.png" alt="Signup page" width="880" height="771"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are running Docker on your computer, you can use the word &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt; instead of the IP address. Throughout this tutorial, we will use the domain &lt;code&gt;demo.appwrite.io&lt;/code&gt; to reference our server running Appwrite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#new-appwrite-project"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🛠️ New Appwrite project
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are on the sign-up page already, so let's make an account, shall we? This process is pretty straightforward. Enter your account information and click &lt;code&gt;Sign Up&lt;/code&gt;. Once we create the account, the website will redirect us to a dashboard where we can see a list of our projects - an empty list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--k2FhihbT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/00stuxe8qyk1xcg50e6c.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--k2FhihbT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/00stuxe8qyk1xcg50e6c.png" alt="Projects list" width="880" height="414"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To interact with Appwrite, we need to create a project. By clicking on the &lt;code&gt;Create Project&lt;/code&gt; button, we open a modal where we can set the project's name and ID. Let's set the name to &lt;code&gt;Almost Netflix&lt;/code&gt; and ID to &lt;code&gt;almostNetflix&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ID is auto-generated by default, but you can click on the edit icon to allow any custom string in this field. You can learn more about this process in our &lt;a href="https://dev.to/appwrite/what-are-appwrites-new-custom-ids--5g6a"&gt;custom IDs article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mbNimD0V--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uya431222zjt0e490enk.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mbNimD0V--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uya431222zjt0e490enk.png" alt="New project modal" width="721" height="656"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project is created within a few seconds, and we are redirected to the project dashboard. There we go, another step finished! 💪&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appwrite provides many services to make app development more accessible and joyful, but we won't be needing all these services for our Almost Netflix project. Thanks to the latest Appwrite update, we can disable specific services we don't need to prevent users from (ab)using them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To disable a service, click &lt;code&gt;Settings&lt;/code&gt; at the bottom of the sidebar. In there, we switch to the &lt;code&gt;Services&lt;/code&gt; tab, and by clicking on toggles of &lt;code&gt;Locale&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Health&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Teams&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Functions&lt;/code&gt;, we disable these services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pBWUGKd4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/iyjo9ykmtn0lu7l2nkwq.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pBWUGKd4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/iyjo9ykmtn0lu7l2nkwq.png" alt="Settings services page" width="880" height="578"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perfect, services configured 👌 There's one more security feature we can enable! This time, let's click &lt;code&gt;Users&lt;/code&gt; in the left menu and switch to the &lt;code&gt;Settings&lt;/code&gt; tab. In this view, we can see all authentication methods allowed by Appwrite. We will only use &lt;code&gt;email/password&lt;/code&gt; to disable the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Xp5EeoVB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ypegvedycecdt6rknb77.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Xp5EeoVB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ypegvedycecdt6rknb77.png" alt="Users settings page" width="880" height="578"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we are satisfied with our project setup. Let's continue by setting up the services we will be using. Thankfully, Almost Netflix only requires one service - &lt;strong&gt;database&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#%F0%9F%97%84-databases-collections-attributes-and-indexes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🗄 Databases, collections, attributes, and indexes
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appwrite database consists of collections. A collection is a group of multiple documents that share the same structure and potentially the same permissions. A document is a simple key-value stored in a JSON format which can also have its own permissions. Every key in a document is called an attribute, and we can configure it to a specific type, maximum length, or default value. Finally, we have indexes to optimize specific filters and sort queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we understand the terms and know what we need to configure for every collection, let's see what collections we will need. For the sake of simplicity, we will store all movie's data in one &lt;code&gt;movies&lt;/code&gt; collection, without any relations. Alongside that, we want to support watchlists so that we will have one collection for that. Let's see how we can configure these two collections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process is explained step-by-step in the Appwrite console, but you can also do this programmatically! 🤩 If you want to use a programmatic setup, you can skip a few following sections and start reading from &lt;a href="#programming-setup"&gt;Programming setup&lt;/a&gt; section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#movies-collection"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Movies collection
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We start by clicking on &lt;code&gt;Database&lt;/code&gt; in the sidebar. We should see an empty database without any collections, so let's make one! We click on &lt;code&gt;Add collection&lt;/code&gt;, set &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Movies&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Collection ID&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;movies&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--humvjLpe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rwboyaw01736lgc2gzvz.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--humvjLpe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rwboyaw01736lgc2gzvz.png" alt="New movies collection" width="880" height="578"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After creating the collection, we will be redirected to the settings page of our collection. We should set up permissions here because by default, Appwrite would not allow anyone to &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; from our new collection. First, we need to decide if we should be using &lt;code&gt;collection-level&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;document-level&lt;/code&gt; permission. Our Almost Netflix use case does not call for document specific permissions, so we'll stick to &lt;code&gt;Collection Level&lt;/code&gt; permissions in our settings page. This option opens up some more customization and allows us to specify who can read documents in this collection and who can create new ones. We want logged-in users to see all movies, and we don't need to allow anyone to create new movies because every user is just a viewer. To write this into the Appwrite permission system, we set &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; permissions to &lt;code&gt;role:member&lt;/code&gt; and keep &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt; permissions empty. Last but not least, we click &lt;code&gt;Update&lt;/code&gt; to apply these changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xO986M4V--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c4na7tgo1383mis6rp7i.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xO986M4V--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c4na7tgo1383mis6rp7i.png" alt="Movies collection settings" width="880" height="1137"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perfect, permissions configured! 💪 Next step, let's configure attributes. We click on the &lt;code&gt;Attributes&lt;/code&gt; tab to see that we don't have any attributes yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--H3A_mzSk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6hs1dxsw6l6tvvn0is88.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--H3A_mzSk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6hs1dxsw6l6tvvn0is88.png" alt="Movies collection attributes" width="880" height="465"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will need to add a bunch of attributes, so let's make a list with all settings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;String attributes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;key&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;size&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;required&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;array&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;name&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;255&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;true&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;description&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;thumbnailImageId&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;255&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;true&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;cast&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;255&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;true&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;true&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;tags&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;255&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;true&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;true&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;genres&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;255&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;true&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;true&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integer attributes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;key&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;min&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;max&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;required&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;durationMinutes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;true&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;netflixReleaseDate&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;releaseDate&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Float attributes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;key&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;min&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;max&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;required&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;trendingIndex&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;true&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boolean attributes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;key&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;required&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;isOriginal&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;true&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enum attributes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;key&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;required&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;elements&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ageRestriction&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;true&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;AR7, AR13, AR16, AR18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we click on &lt;code&gt;Add Attribute&lt;/code&gt; and select the type of attribute we want to add, a modal will be opened, and we can configure data from the list above. Once configured, we click &lt;code&gt;Create&lt;/code&gt; to create one attribute. We repeat these steps for all the attributes until we have the list complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--h1n8PNf9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nfxqupijiqfoed01qls7.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--h1n8PNf9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nfxqupijiqfoed01qls7.png" alt="Movies collection with all attributes" width="880" height="904"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woah, that took quite some time. Good thing we played with so many different types and configurations. Now we can call ourselves experts of Appwrite attributes 😎&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To finish the setup of the movies collection, let's switch to the indexes tab. Again, we are presented with an empty list since we didn't add anything yet. We will need multiple indexes for different filters and sorting we will do in our application in the future, so let's prepare the list again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;key&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;type&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;attributes&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;trendingIndexDESC&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;key&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;trendingIndex(DESC)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;isOriginalDESC&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;key&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;isOriginal(DESC)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;durationMinutesDESC&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;key&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;durationMinutes(DESC)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;releaseDateDESC&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;key&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;releaseDate(DESC)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;nameFULLTEXT&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;fulltext&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;name(ASC)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;genresFULLTEXT&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;fulltext&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;genres(ASC)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;castFULLTEXT&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;fulltext&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;cast(ASC)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;tagsFULLTEXT&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;fulltext&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;tags(ASC)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly to attributes, we now click on &lt;code&gt;Add Index&lt;/code&gt; and fill the form with information from our list. We repeat until we have all indexes added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3J6R6MSt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2s84qvkrnmh9xj9gusro.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3J6R6MSt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2s84qvkrnmh9xj9gusro.png" alt="Movies collection with all indexes" width="880" height="847"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, the movies collection is ready! 🥳 By making this huge collection, we learned a lot of concepts and got really confident with the Appwrite interface. Here is cookie 🍪 for your effort if you followed along this far! If you ever meet me, you can trade this for a real cookie 😉 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#watchlists-collection"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Watchlists collection
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's do the same for the watchlist collection, but since we already understand the process, let's speed it up a little 😏&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We create a new collection with name &lt;code&gt;Watchlists&lt;/code&gt; and ID &lt;code&gt;watchlists&lt;/code&gt;. We keep permissions on &lt;code&gt;document-level&lt;/code&gt;, since users should only see their documents. We add the following attributes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;String attributes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;key&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;size&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;required&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;array&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;userId&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;255&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;true&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;movieId&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;255&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;true&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integer attributes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;key&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;min&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;max&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;required&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;createdAt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;true&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also add the following indexes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;key&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;type&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;attributes&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;createdAtDESC&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;key&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;createdAt(DESC)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;userIdASCmovieIdASC&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;key&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;userId(ASC), movieId(ASC)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voilà, watchlist collection setup finished ✨ There's one final step though. We need to add documents into our collections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#programming-setup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🌎 Programming setup &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to create hundreds of documents, which we don't want to do manually, of course. We also don't have any data, so we will need to use some 3rd party API... What do we do now? 🤔&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Appwrite server-side SDKs, we can pick any coding language and write a programmatic setup of Appwrite documents using it. I decided to pick JavaScript for this example because this language is easy to follow along and understand when reading, in my opinion. You can also find the complete source code of the project setup in &lt;a href="https://github.com/Meldiron/almost-netflix-project-setup"&gt;this GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let's clone the programmatic setup GitHub repository to download all the source code. Then, let's enter the folder and install all NPM libraries needed for the script to work properly:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git clone https://github.com/Meldiron/almost-netflix-project-setup.git
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;almost-netflix-project-setup
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;npm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We need to set up some secrets for the script to work correctly. Let's create &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file and put this information in there:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=
APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=
APPWRITE_API_KEY=
MDB_API_KEY=
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can find the Appwrite endpoint and project ID in the settings of your project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can create an API key in the &lt;code&gt;API Keys&lt;/code&gt; section of your Appwrite project. You can give it all permissions to make sure it has access to all services we might need to use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can get your MDB API key by signing up to TMDB. Learn more in &lt;a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api"&gt;TMDB docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are set! 😎 Let's now use this script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you set up the database manually, you can ignore the following paragraph and command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you didn't follow previous sections to set up movies and watchlists collections, now it's a great time to use a programmatic setup for that. I personally prefer using a programmatic setup to create collections, attributes, and indexes. This way, I keep the setup in a file that can be pushed to version control (Git). To run the script that creates all of that, we run:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;node src/migrations.js
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The final step is to insert documents. Thankfully, we have a script for downloading the movie list and their images from TMDB, so all we need to do is to run the script and wait until it's finished:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;node src/seeds.js
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If everything goes well, we can see documents in our movies collections and many movie covers in our storage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>“Tu perfil se ajusta a este empleo”</title>
      <author>Manu Martinez</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 09:23:07 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/whitehatdevv/tu-perfil-se-ajusta-a-este-empleo-2dc7</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/whitehatdevv/tu-perfil-se-ajusta-a-este-empleo-2dc7</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cuántas veces habrás leído en una oferta de trabajo la frase “Tu perfil se ajusta a este empleo”, para luego descubrir que lo único que se ajusta en ella es tan solo una palabra que coincide con tu currículum profesional? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;El otro día, como de costumbre, andaba perdiendo el tiempo haciendo scroll infinito en LinkedIn y ya que estaba, mi curiosidad me llevó a investigar algunas ofertas de trabajo (no sé que tiene esta plataforma, que terminas entrado una o dos veces al día y antes que te des cuenta, has malgastado 20 minutos de tu tiempo en publicaciones sobre fotos de bodas y packs de bienvenida de empresa, así como artículos en los que se glorifica hasta la obtención de la licencia de conducir... pero no te preocupes que de esto ya hablaremos otro día 😂).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quizás te haya comentando en los &lt;a href="https://dev.to/whitehatdevv/series/16158"&gt;anteriores post&lt;/a&gt; que trabajo como desarrollador, así que lo más normal es que estuviera investigando ofertas sobre mi campo profesional, pero en vez de buscar por el nombre de mi profesión, decidí buscar directamente por mi ubicación (que quieres que te diga, a veces la pereza lleva a límites insospechados). Si bien es cierto que la mayoría de las ofertas estaban dentro de mi sector profesional (desarrollador, ingeniero de software, etc), de entre todas ellas hubo una que me llamó la atención en particular: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Abogado bilingüe español-alemán”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Y justo debajo, aparecía la foto de mi perfil con el siguiente comentario: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Tu perfil se ajusta a este empleo”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;En ese preciso momento me di cuenta de lo desastroso que puede llegar a ser LinkedIn recomendando ofertas. Y es que se puede saber que tengo yo que ver con la Abogacía? Y lo mismo digo del Alemán. En lo único que coincidía con ese título era el español, pero nada más. Si bien es cierto que sé algo de leyes (como las de tráfico o que no hay que hacer ruido pasadas las 22h de la noche) de ahí a decirme que encajo en un puesto de abogado es dar un salto más grande que Neil Armstrong llegando a la luna. 🚀 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sé puede saber que te he hecho LinkedIn para que me recomiendes ofertas que parecen salidas de la chistera de un mago? 🐰&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tengo que decir, que tras mi asombro inicial, decidí leer más acerca de aquella oferta, no fuera a ser que se tratase de la mayor oportunidad profesional de mi vida y que ni siquiera yo conocía. Pero tras leer una y otra vez toda la descripción y requisitos que ofrecía el anuncio, no logré a ver que palabras clave había utilizado el algoritmo de LinkedIn para relacionarme con ese empleo. Entiendo que su objetivo principal sea ser una red social, pero la mayoría de usuarios que entran en la plataforma lo hacen para buscar trabajo. Trabajo de lo suyo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahora bien, desde ese día en que me metí a leer la oferta para abogado, me van llegado de vez en cuando mensajes de LinkedIn al correo, recomendándome empleos similares. Todos ellos sobre abogacía, claro está. 😐 Tal vez deba hacer caso y hacer un drástico cambio de profesión. Al fin y al cabo, me lo está recomendado LinkedIn. Qué mal podría hacerme? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Con lo sencillo que es comparar varias preferencias y habilidades, y a partir de ahí, ir mostrando ofertas que se ajusten a uno mismo. Pero siempre tiene que haber alguien que lo complique todo más de la cuenta. Y parece ser que hoy LinkedIn repite en el primer puesto. Si no fuera por la cantidad de memes sobre programación que puedo ver, ya me habría vuelto a Instagram hace tiempo! Esta claro que todas estas plataformas para encontrar trabajo (tales como Infojobs, Indeed, etc) necesitan un cambio drástico en sus funciones, necesitan centrarse en lograr cumplir con aquello que promulgan. Eso es al menos lo que dice la ley que se debe hacer. Créeme, sé de lo que hablo, al fin y al cabo, podría ser abogado bilingüe español-alemán.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Showing "time ago" in a Social Feed using Intl.RelativeTimeFormat</title>
      <author>Mads Stoumann</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 09:19:36 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/madsstoumann/showing-time-ago-in-a-social-feed-using-intlrelativetimeformat-5ceo</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/madsstoumann/showing-time-ago-in-a-social-feed-using-intlrelativetimeformat-5ceo</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I'm currently implementing a &lt;em&gt;Social Feed&lt;/em&gt; for a client, and had some issues with vulnerabilities in &lt;code&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; and an old "time-ago"-library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspecting the code, I could see, that the code took a &lt;code&gt;Date&lt;/code&gt;-object with &lt;code&gt;.getTime()&lt;/code&gt;, compared it with the current time — &lt;code&gt;new Date().getTime()&lt;/code&gt; — and then used a lot of code to return strings like "3 minutes ago", "2 days ago" etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of finding another and newer "time-ago"-library, I decided to give it a go myself, and stumbled upon the &lt;code&gt;RelativeTimeFormat&lt;/code&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/RelativeTimeFormat"&gt;Intl&lt;/a&gt;-API — supported in all browsers except &lt;em&gt;Internet Explorer&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These wonderful methods greatly simplifies the code needed for a "time-ago"-library, so I wrote this simple method:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;timeAgo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;timestamp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;locale&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;en&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;diff&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getTime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;timestamp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getTime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;minutes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;floor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;diff&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hours&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;floor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;minutes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;days&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;floor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hours&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;months&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;floor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;days&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;years&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;floor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;months&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;rtf&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Intl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;RelativeTimeFormat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;locale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;numeric&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;years&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;rtf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;years&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;rtf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hours&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;hour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;minutes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;rtf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;minutes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;minute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;rtf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;diff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;second&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's &lt;strong&gt;387 bytes minified&lt;/strong&gt;, and just &lt;strong&gt;244 bytes gzipped&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#testing-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Testing it
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm writing this on January 18th 2022, so this snippet:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;date1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;2022-01-01&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;timeAgo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;date1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;... returns "17 days ago". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's change the locale to German:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;timeAgo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;date1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;de&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This returns "vor 17 Tagen"´. With the locale &lt;code&gt;fr&lt;/code&gt;, it returns "il y a 17 jours". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try it yourself with your own language-locale.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Now, let's try a timestamp, that is just a few minutes in the past (as of time of writing!):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;date1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;2022-01-18T08:30:00.000Z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This returns "6 minutes ago" with an english locale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you just parse &lt;code&gt;new Date()&lt;/code&gt;, the string will be "now" with an english locale. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your &lt;code&gt;Date()&lt;/code&gt; is in the future, it will be "[years|months|days|hours|minutes|seconds] from now".&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#not-all-months-are-30-days"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Not all months are 30 days
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of you might have wondered about this line of code:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;months&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;floor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;days&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And yes, this is not super-accurate, but an average value.&lt;br&gt;
If you have timelines with very old entries, you might want to &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2536379/difference-in-months-between-two-dates-in-javascript"&gt;add a bit more code&lt;/a&gt; to handle &lt;code&gt;months&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;years&lt;/code&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introducing the Offen Protocol</title>
      <author>Hendrik</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 09:10:24 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/hendr_ik/introducing-the-offen-protocol-3inm</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/hendr_ik/introducing-the-offen-protocol-3inm</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are building &lt;a href="https://www.offen.dev/?utm_source=forum&amp;amp;utm_campaign=210"&gt;Offen,&lt;/a&gt; a fair and lightweight web analytics software that treats operators and users as equal parties. Along the way, we discovered many subtleties and details to consider and created the Offen Protocol for all software out there that aims to handle usage data in a transparent way. Read the full version of &lt;a href="https://www.offen.dev/blog/offen-protocol/?utm_source=forum&amp;amp;utm_campaign=210"&gt;this article on the Offen blog.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The underlying concept is the definition of five actions that clients can take when they interact with a server that processes their data. These actions correspond to the rights of the data subject as defined by GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Probe&lt;/strong&gt; is used to request additional information about the service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Register&lt;/strong&gt; is used when a client wants to make itself known to the server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Submit&lt;/strong&gt; is the action taken when a client transfers data to the client.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Query&lt;/strong&gt; will be used when clients want to query the server for data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Purge&lt;/strong&gt; can be used by clients that want to initiate removal of data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full specification document can be &lt;a href="https://offen.github.io/protocol/"&gt;found on the website&lt;/a&gt;. The protocol is not overly complicated and is perhaps even more of a convention than a specification. However, we have extracted what we use in Offen and added these implementations to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/offen/protocol"&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;, which also contains the specification itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please let us know what you think. We’re happy to open the discussion: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hioffen"&gt;tweet at us&lt;/a&gt;, send us &lt;a href="//mailto:hioffen@posteo.de"&gt;an email&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://github.com/offen/protocol"&gt;open an issue on the GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Some Techniques to Enhance Your Terraform Proficiency</title>
      <author>Serhii Vasylenko</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 09:05:09 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/aws-builders/some-techniques-to-enhance-your-terraform-proficiency-4n9e</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/aws-builders/some-techniques-to-enhance-your-terraform-proficiency-4n9e</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Terraform built-in functionality is very feature-rich: functions, expressions, and meta-arguments provide many ways to shape the code and fit it to a particular use case. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to share a few valuable practices to boost your Terraform expertise in this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1️⃣ &lt;em&gt;Some code examples in this article will work with Terraform version 0.15 and onwards. But if you’re still using 0.14 or lower, here’s another motivation for you to upgrade&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2️⃣ &lt;em&gt;I'll be using AWS Terraform provider code examples throughout the article but mentioned Terraform functions and expressions are provider-agnostic and will work the same with other providers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conditional-resources-creation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conditional resources creation
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dOYlsteO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/09b7epalarykbci29yqz.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dOYlsteO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/09b7epalarykbci29yqz.png" alt="Conditional resources creation" width="880" height="440"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start from the most popular one (although, still may be new for somebody): whether to create a resource depending on some fact, e.g., the value of a variable. Terraform meta-argument &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; helps to describe that kind of logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is how it may look like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight terraform"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"aws_ssm_parameter"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"ami_id"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ami_channel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;local&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ami_channels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ami_channel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The notation &lt;code&gt;var.ami_channel == "" ? 0 : 1&lt;/code&gt; is called &lt;em&gt;conditional expression&lt;/em&gt; and means the following: if my variable is empty (&lt;code&gt;var.ami_channel == ""&lt;/code&gt; — hence, true) then set the count to 0, otherwise set to 1.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight terraform"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;condition&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;true_val&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;false_val&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In this illustration, I want to get the AMI ID from the SSM Parameter only if the AMI channel (e.g., beta or alpha) is specified. Otherwise, providing that the &lt;code&gt;ami_channel&lt;/code&gt; variable is an empty string by default (""), the data source should not be created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When following this method, keep in mind that the resource address will contain the index identifier. So when I need to use the value of the SSM parameter from our example, I need to reference it the following way:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight terraform"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ami_id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;aws_ssm_parameter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ami_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; meta-argument can also be used to create a whole module conditionally:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight terraform"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"bucket"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;create_bucket&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"./modules/s3_bucket"&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"my-unique-bucket"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;var.create_bucket == true ? 1 : 0&lt;/code&gt; expression can be written even shorter: &lt;code&gt;var.create_bucket ? 1 : 0&lt;/code&gt; because the &lt;code&gt;create_bucket&lt;/code&gt; variable has boolean type, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if you need to produce more than one instance of a resource or module? And still be able to avoid their creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another meta-argument — &lt;code&gt;for_each&lt;/code&gt; — will do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, this is how it looks for a module:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight terraform"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"bucket"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;for_each&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;bucket_names&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;bucket_names&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"./modules/s3_bucket"&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;each&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;enable_encryption&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In this illustration, I also used a conditional expression that makes Terraform iterate through the set of values of &lt;code&gt;var.bucket_names&lt;/code&gt; if it’s not empty and create several modules. Otherwise, do not iterate at all and do not create anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same can be done for the resources. For example, when you need to create an arbitrary number of security group rules, e.g., to allowlist some IPs for your bastion host:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight terraform"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;resource&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"aws_security_group_rule"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"allowlist"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;for_each&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cidr_blocks&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cidr_blocks&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"ingress"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;from_port&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;to_port&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;protocol&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"tcp"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cidr_blocks&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;each&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;security_group_id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;aws_security_group&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;bastion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And just like with the &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; meta-argument, with the &lt;code&gt;for_each&lt;/code&gt;, resource addresses will have the identifier named by the values provided to &lt;code&gt;for_each&lt;/code&gt;. For example, here is how I would reference a resource created in the module with &lt;code&gt;for_each&lt;/code&gt; described earlier:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight terraform"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;bucket_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;bucket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"photos"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conditional-resource-arguments-attributes-setting"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conditional resource arguments (attributes) setting
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--k7GEhpIE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/67dnkfbwei8rcaprq7x2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--k7GEhpIE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/67dnkfbwei8rcaprq7x2.png" alt="Conditional resource arguments" width="880" height="440"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s go deeper and see how resource arguments can be conditionally set (or not).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let’s review the conditional argument value setting with the &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; data type:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight terraform"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;resource&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"aws_launch_template"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"this"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"my-launch-template"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;key_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;use_default_keypair&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;keypair_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here I want to skip the usage of the EC2 Key Pair for the Launch Template in some instances and Terraform allows me to write the conditional expression that will set the &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; value for the argument. It means the &lt;em&gt;absence&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;omission&lt;/em&gt; and Terraform would behave the same as if you did not specify the argument at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dynamic blocks are another case where this technique suits best. Take a look at the following piece of CloudFront resource code where I want to either describe the configuration for the custom error response or omit that completely:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight terraform"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;resource&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"aws_cloudfront_distribution"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"cdn"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;enabled&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dynamic&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"custom_error_response"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;for_each&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;custom_error_response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;custom_error_response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;iterator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cer&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;error_code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;lookup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"error_code"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;error_caching_min_ttl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;lookup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"error_caching_min_ttl"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response_code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;lookup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"response_code"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response_page_path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;lookup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"response_page_path"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;custom_error_response&lt;/code&gt; variable is &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; by default, but it has the &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt; type, and users can assign the variable with the required nested specifications if needed. And when they do it, Terraform will add the &lt;code&gt;custom_error_response&lt;/code&gt; block to the resource configuration. Otherwise, it will be omitted entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#convert-types-with-ease"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Convert types with ease
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IMwFnm1j--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xlycu80ki7u1z5eur4wn.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IMwFnm1j--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xlycu80ki7u1z5eur4wn.png" alt="Convert types with ease" width="880" height="440"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, let’s move to the less conditional things now 😅&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terraform has several type conversion functions: &lt;code&gt;tobool()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;tolist()&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;tomap()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;tonumber()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;toset()&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;tostring()&lt;/code&gt;. Their purpose is to convert the input values to the compatible types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, suppose I need to pass the set to the &lt;code&gt;for_each&lt;/code&gt; (it accepts only sets and maps types of value), but I got the list as an input; let’s say I got it as an output from another module. In such a case, I would do something like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight terraform"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;for_each&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;toset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;remote_access_ports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;However, I can make my code cleaner and avoid the explicit conversion — I just need to define the value type in the configuration block of the &lt;code&gt;my_list&lt;/code&gt; variable. Terraform will do the conversion automatically when the value is assigned.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight terraform"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;variable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"remote_access_ports"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Ports for remote access"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While Terraform can do a lot of implicit conversions for you, explicit type conversions are practical during values normalization or when you need to calculate some complex value for a variable. For example, the Local Values, known as &lt;code&gt;locals&lt;/code&gt;, are the most suitable place for doing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, although there is a &lt;code&gt;tolist()&lt;/code&gt; function, there is no such thing as the &lt;code&gt;tostring()&lt;/code&gt; function. But what if you need to convert the list to string in Terraform?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;one()&lt;/code&gt; function can help here: it takes a list, set, or tuple value with either zero or one element and returns either &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; or that one element in the form of string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s useful in cases when a resource created using conditional expression is represented as either a zero- or one-element list, and you need to get a single value which may be either &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;, for example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight terraform"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;resource&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"aws_kms_key"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"main"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ebs_encrypted&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;enable_key_rotation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;tags&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;tags&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;resource&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"aws_kms_alias"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"main"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ebs_encrypted&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"alias/encrypt-ebs"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;target_key_id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;one&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;aws_kms_key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[*]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;key_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#write-yaml-or-json-as-terraform-code-hcl"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Write YAML or JSON as Terraform code (HCL)
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---ZLnIaGg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cdwhx72j67nywt1wqcfo.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---ZLnIaGg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cdwhx72j67nywt1wqcfo.png" alt="Write YAML or JSON as Terraform code" width="880" height="440"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you need to supply JSON or YAML files to the services you manage with Terraform. For example, if you want to create something with CloudFormation using Terraform (and I am not kidding). Sometimes the AWS Terraform provider does not support the needed resource, and you want to maintain the whole infrastructure code using only one tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of maintaining another file in JSON or YAML format, you can embed JSON or YAML code management into HCL by taking benefit of the &lt;code&gt;jsonencode()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;yamlencode()&lt;/code&gt; functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attractiveness of this approach is that you can reference other Terraform resources or their attributes right in the code of your object, and you have more freedom in terms of the code syntax and its formatting comparable to native JSON or YAML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is how it looks like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight terraform"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;locals&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;some_string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"ult"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;myjson_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;jsonencode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Hashicorp Products"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Terra&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"form"&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Con&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"sul"&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Vag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"rant"&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Va&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;local&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;some_string&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The value of the &lt;code&gt;myjson_object&lt;/code&gt; local variable would look like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"Hashicorp Products"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"Con"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"sul"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"Terra"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"form"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"Va"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"ult"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"Vag"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"rant"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And here is a piece of real-world example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight terraform"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;locals&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cf_template_body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;jsonencode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Resources&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;DedicatedHostGroup&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"AWS::ResourceGroups::Group"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Properties&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;service_name&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Configuration&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"AWS::EC2::HostManagement"&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Parameters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"auto-allocate-host"&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Values&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;auto_allocate_host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#templatize-stuff"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Templatize stuff
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KrT7OP2k--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/et3x95e5se6wlvuyasp9.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KrT7OP2k--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/et3x95e5se6wlvuyasp9.png" alt="Templatize stuff" width="880" height="440"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last case in this blog but not the least by its efficacy — render source file content as a template in Terraform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s review the following scenario: you launch an EC2 instance and want to supply it with a bash script (via the user-data parameter) for some additional configuration at launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose we have the following bash script &lt;code&gt;instance-init.sh&lt;/code&gt; that sets the hostname and registers our instance in a monitoring system:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;hostname &lt;/span&gt;example.com
bash /opt/system-init/register-monitoring.sh
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But what if you want to set a different hostname per instance, and some instances should not be registered in the monitoring system?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In such a case, here is how the script file content will look:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!/bin/bash

hostname ${system_hostname}
%{ if register_monitoring }
bash /opt/system-init/register-monitoring.sh
%{endif}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And when you supply this file as an argument for the EC2 instance resource in Terraform, you will use the &lt;code&gt;templatefile()&lt;/code&gt; function to make the magic happen:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight terraform"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;resource&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"aws_instance"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"web"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ami&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;my_ami_id&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;instance_type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;instance_type&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user_data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;templatefile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;module}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/instance-init.tftpl"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;system_hostname&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;system_hostname&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;register_monitoring&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;add_to_monitoring&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And of course, you can create a template from any file type. The only requirement here is that the template file must exist on the disk at the beginning of the Terraform execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#key-takeaways"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Key takeaways
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terraform is far beyond the standard resource management operations. With the power of built-in functions, you can write more versatile code and reusable Terraform modules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;✅ Use &lt;a href="https://www.terraform.io/language/expressions/conditionals"&gt;conditional expressions&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.terraform.io/language/meta-arguments/count"&gt;count&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.terraform.io/language/meta-arguments/for_each"&gt;for_each&lt;/a&gt; meta-arguments, when the creation of a resource depends on some context or user inout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;✅ Take advantage of &lt;a href="https://www.terraform.io/language/expressions/types#type-conversion"&gt;implicit types conversion&lt;/a&gt; when working with input variables and their values to keep your code cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;✅ Embed YAML and JSON-based objects right into your Terraform code using built-in &lt;a href="https://www.terraform.io/language/functions/jsonencode"&gt;encoding&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.terraform.io/language/functions/yamlencode"&gt;functions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;✅ And when you need to pass some files to the managed service, you can treat them as &lt;a href="https://www.terraform.io/language/functions/templatefile"&gt;templates&lt;/a&gt; and make them multipurpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading down to this point! 🤗&lt;/p&gt;
