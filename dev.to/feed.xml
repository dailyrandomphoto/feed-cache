      <link>https://dev.to/amfstacks/life-lessons-the-fourth-passenger-4in8</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/amfstacks/life-lessons-the-fourth-passenger-4in8</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have dropped the pen for a while but looking at the stacks of UN-shared life lessons and write ups !&lt;br&gt;
I have to share this and lighten the vessel .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fourth passenger&lt;/strong&gt; is borne out of a whole lot of personal and virtual experiences, I really hope y'all able to get the message !&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;I boarded an "along" vehicle ,&lt;br&gt;
Four passengers are to be at the back seat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though, I am very sure the back seat was originally designed to accommodate 3 passengers , but you know, prices of things have gone up!, even the drivers need to make ends meet and NURTW does not apparently care about the welfare of passengers&lt;br&gt;
(if at all they ever did).&lt;br&gt;
So they stuff the back seats with 4 passengers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, on this particular day,&lt;br&gt;
I was the third passenger,&lt;br&gt;
It was barely convenient for us even before &lt;strong&gt;the fourth passenger&lt;/strong&gt; joined us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The driver drove on with the hope of getting &lt;strong&gt;the fourth passenger&lt;/strong&gt; along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could not contain the thought of a &lt;strong&gt;fourth passenger&lt;/strong&gt; joining us, it would be worse !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I decided to pay for the &lt;strong&gt;fourth&lt;/strong&gt; (vacant) seat but I kept this plan to myself and stayed mute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping mute is not so nice but cunningly smart …..&lt;br&gt;
You can't blame me too,&lt;br&gt;
We are all saving cost ! 😂.&lt;br&gt;
No one knew my intention of paying for the fourth seat, &lt;br&gt;
We kept moving !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is the exact plan…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was actually waiting ….. to see if the driver would be able to make &lt;strong&gt;efforts&lt;/strong&gt; to find a &lt;strong&gt;fourth passenger&lt;/strong&gt; to shove to the back seat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, that would determine my next line of action .&lt;br&gt;
If he happens to find a &lt;strong&gt;fourth passenger&lt;/strong&gt;, then,&lt;br&gt;
I will reveal my intention of paying for the extra (fourth) seat 💺 ….. 😞!&lt;br&gt;
And If he does not find any, I will just "throway face" and continue to enjoy the "free-spaced" ride.!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, …..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's exactly how lot of things are in life !&lt;br&gt;
I have seen several life scenarios based exactly on this model!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lotta people are waiting to see&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt; "if you would make it"&lt;br&gt;
"If you could do it"&lt;br&gt;
"If you could achieve it"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before proffering their (long) "&lt;strong&gt;due&lt;/strong&gt;" responsibilities, duties, and help ….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have seen it played out a lot in life,&lt;br&gt;
Lot of people would only step in to help you, do the right thing they needed to have done, only when they discovered you have been able to pull through without their actions and or in-actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people are denied their due benefits 'cause they were thought undeserving, or they have not made enough efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some are waiting to see if you are "worth" it, or whether you deserved it according to their own criteria before giving it to you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I was concerned ,&lt;br&gt;
The driver &lt;strong&gt;did not worth&lt;/strong&gt; getting paid for a passenger he has not found until he actually got one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lot of people won't help you until you have made a positively resulted efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's why your rich uncle or friend might not help you with your educational pursuit until you study hard and you graduate!&lt;br&gt;
You know, that's a point when you can actually do without their involvement!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's why your company won't promote you at the due time until you work so much on yourself till they see other companies bidding for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In relationships,&lt;br&gt;
A lot of people don't value or rate their partners until their partners are valued by someone more than them!&lt;br&gt;
It's not like people really want to step in and assist you, they will only be forced to do so when they know you have grown to a level you can do without their so called assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Psychologically, some people find it easier to help those that don't actually need the help, than the actual needy ones !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The baseline message is&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;em&gt;TRY,&lt;br&gt;
make EFFORTS ,&lt;br&gt;
Help yourself ,&lt;br&gt;
Build yourself *&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Try your best on your own without necessarily depending on a virtual or promised help anywhere!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lot of people would proffer lot of helps, advices , assistances when you are already up there, when you technically don't really need their assistance and you will just wonder where were all these before you got here !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can keep on with so many examples and (not personal) experiences ..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a newbie on some stuffs , &lt;br&gt;
I really needed some one to just put me through but my supposed helper (maybe sincerely)was too busy! &lt;br&gt;
But he came back looking for me to help me when he knew I have been able to get them fixed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I needed a setup from a friend,&lt;br&gt;
He didn't give me, by the time he learnt I have made research and found an alternative and sure source of getting the same setup !&lt;br&gt;
He proffered the same aid I earlier requested!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company I worked with delayed my promotion but swept to action when they got the news of a bigger company fixing a virtual appointment meeting with me .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot !&lt;br&gt;
Some scenarios are just too ridiculous!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't make (right) efforts to put your self up, No body will rate you !&lt;br&gt;
Make (right) efforts !&lt;br&gt;
Make efforts to get your &lt;strong&gt;fourth passenger&lt;/strong&gt; and you would be surprised at how many were &lt;strong&gt;willing&lt;/strong&gt; to pay for the fourth seat!&lt;br&gt;
The fourth passenger ~ amfstacks&lt;br&gt;
✍️🙏🏽&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-does-an-nft-marketplace-work"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How Does An NFT Marketplace Work?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following are the simple steps that briefly explain how the NFT marketplace works. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Irrespective of the buyer or seller, the foremost step they have to take is to sign up with the platform by specifying the required information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the initial setup, a verification process has to be followed, which includes KYC. Once done with the verification, the crypto wallet will be created.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Henceforth, the users will be able to mint their works and their NFTs will be listed in the marketplace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The buyers who have interest in your NFT works would place their bids when works come for auction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the seller is self-satisfied with the bids, the auction will be closed and transactions made. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From now, the buyer will have ownership of the NFT works and these will be saved in their wallets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#salient-features-to-consider-during-nft-marketplace-development"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Salient Features To Consider During NFT Marketplace Development

&lt;p&gt;To define how deep learning can benefit people in healthcare and medical aspects, let’s look into the healthcare treatments. So people apply deep learning in healthcare to assist professionals in the medical sciences and lab technicians. Here are a few benefits of deep learning in healthcare that you might know: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep learning in healthcare can be a learning tool collecting data and recording information about patients, their symptoms, and treatments. Doctors or professionals in the medical field can use this information as a future preference for the patients’ treatments. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep learning in healthcare allows you to create a model based on data sources available when you require a risk score on administration. Furthermore, &lt;a href="https://adamosoft.com/"&gt;healthcare software development firms&lt;/a&gt; apply deep learning techniques in healthcare to provide accurate and timely risk scores. That boosts confidence and appropriately allocates the resources. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When using deep learning in healthcare, people can reduce costs and get improved outcomes. For example, &lt;a href="https://adamosoft.com/electronic-health-records-software-ehr"&gt;electronic health records&lt;/a&gt; (EHR) and &lt;a href="https://adamosoft.com/blog/medicine-apps-as-a-patients-assistant-for-medication-intake/"&gt;digital healthcare applications&lt;/a&gt; can make data more accessible to trained algorithms than ever. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thanks to deep learning in healthcare, health staff give more accurate and faster diagnostics during patient treatments. Doctors can identify patterns by connecting custom healthcare software.  For instance, deep learning in healthcare can determine whether the skin lesions are cancerous or not like any certificated dermatologists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#top-applications-of-deep-learning-in-healthcare"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Top applications of deep learning in healthcare
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#computer-vision-one-of-the-largest-successes-of-deep-learning-in-healthcare"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Computer vision: One of the largest successes of deep learning in healthcare
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computer vision emphasizes images and videos and handles tasks such as object classification, segmentation, and detection. This deep learning technique is useful in determining whether patients’ radiograph contains malignant tumors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medical imaging, for example, can benefit from advances in object classification and image detection. Many studies have proved the results in complicated diagnostics spanning dermatology, radiology, and pathology. Furthermore, deep learning in healthcare could support physicians by giving second opinions and providing concerning areas in images. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, the models of deep learning in healthcare have obtained physician-level accuracy at a variety of diagnostic tasks. Thanks to the custom healthcare software, people can identify moles from melanomas, diabetic retinopathy, cardiovascular risk, and spinal analysis with magnetic resonance imaging. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#natural-language-processing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Natural language processing
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Natural language processing is one of the top applications of deep learning in healthcare. This application of deep learning in the medical field focuses on analyzing text and speech to infer meaning from words. When developing custom healthcare software, software engineers use deep learning algorithms to process inputs such as language, speech, and time-series data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significant successes of natural language processing include machine translation, image captioning, and text creation. In terms of the healthcare industry, sequential deep learning and healthcare languages benefit &lt;a href="https://adamosoft.com/electronic-health-records-software-ehr"&gt;electronic health records&lt;/a&gt; (EHR). For example, a hospital typically generates about 150,000 pieces of data. With such a huge amount of data, the applications of deep learning in healthcare can solve many problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#reinforcement-learning"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Reinforcement learning
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one of the most successful applications of deep learning in healthcare, reinforcement learning is a technique to train computational agents. This reinforcement learning can happen through trial and error, demonstration, or a hybrid method. &lt;a href="https://adamosoft.com/health-care-software-development"&gt;Healthcare software development firms&lt;/a&gt; use reinforcement learning in which health fields accomplish better goals through learning expert demonstration. People can learn to predict the expert’s actions through imitation or by inferring the experts’ objectives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another healthcare domain that can benefit from deep reinforcement learning is robotic-assisted surgery (RAS). Deep learning can promote the robustness of RAS by using computer vision models to adapt to surgical environments and learn from physical motions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#generalized-deep-learning"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Generalized deep learning
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond computer vision, natural language processing, etc, generalized deep learning is adaptable to healthcare domains where data requires customized processes. More specifically, modern genomic technologies collect various measurements of proteins in their blood. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, deep learning in healthcare can use these data to analyze these measures, so it helps to provide more accurate treatments and diagnosis. Moreover, deep learning can further boost additional modalities such as medical images, and wearable device data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#future-of-deep-learning-a-ray-of-hope-for-medical-and-health-fields"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Future of deep learning: A ray of hope for medical and health fields
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future of deep learning in healthcare has never been more promising. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning not only bring such a precious opportunity to develop custom healthcare software meeting specific needs.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let it be the child who asks you with curiosity  "What are you doing?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the child see you programming with a big astonished face or a woow expression, try to not finish bad with your ex-girlfriend (her uncle), or you will be feel pretty bad for loose a diamond in the middle of the way. A child that feel passion for programing without scratch or a very visual interface (not the ex-girlfriend obviously)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"The blender system"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is probabily the most easiest way to explain to a non proggramer guy, what is a function and what is programming&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The future of Salesforce will be bright and enthusiastic, it will continue to grow and reach new heights. First of all, Salesforce CRM is the market leader in the CRM domain and generates huge revenue. As business dependencies are increasing on Salesforce, testing of the ERP becomes the prime concern. Salesforce Testing is a critical element of Salesforce administration and implementation. All Salesforce specialists must apply testing methodologies to their areas of expertise. In this blog, we are going to emphasize the challenges of Salesforce testing and how a predictive test automation tool Opkey with the power of AI overcomes all your challenges.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The automated testing of Salesforce is challenging as most web pages are dynamic in nature on the Salesforce platform. Therefore, Salesforce demands that automation testers create a strong automation framework to sustain in the future. In the search for the best automation tool to automate Salesforce testing, many choose Selenium as their go-to tool. If you’re also considering using Selenium to test Salesforce, read on to ensure you make an informed decision and learn about the challenges that await you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combined, the Selenium toolset offers a number of possibilities for Salesforce test automation. Selenium is a popular software testing tool that is open-source and supports most browsers and operating systems. It is perhaps best known for allowing testers to automate in any preferred programming language. The problem is, not all testers know how to program. Because of this, testers can end up spending a lot of time setting up and maintaining automation flows. So the question is: Is Selenium worth the time investment?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Selenium has many benefits, it also lacks a number of features to make it the ultimate Salesforce test automation tool. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, Selenium only allows you to test web apps, not mobile or desktop apps. So, end to end test automation across all enterprise ecosystems becomes a big challenge for enterprises using Selenium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Useful features like reporting and data-driven testing are only possible with the integration of additional tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Test scripts that are created with Selenium, require a significant maintenance effort to keep the scripts up to date with regular changes coming with every Salesforce update.&lt;br&gt;
Selenium-based scripts don’t understand the impact of change after any update nor perform any risk-based analysis.&lt;br&gt;
In other words, Selenium is by no means an “all-in-one” platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us look at some technical testing challenges with Selenium scripting, particularly to Salesforce test automation, and how a codeless automation tool Opkey relieves many headaches for software testing teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Handling Dynamic Elements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dynamic elements are more common in ERPs such as Salesforce and SAP. These elements change locator with each page load. Oftentimes, this is the ID that changes, as it is dynamically generated with each page load. Consequently, the test may fail where a dynamic element is present, creating many false positives when initiated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opkey offers its intelligent AI-powered recorder, which can use self-healing technology to update location strategies when dynamic elements change locators. Best of all, Opkey’s test builder is updated with a more robust localization strategy, so your test will run smoothly on subsequent runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Navigation through windows/tabs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It’s common in today’s complex application landscape to have tests across multiple browser tabs or even windows. Oftentimes, you may also need to interact with multiple sites, validating that information flowed from one system to another. Maintaining browser state and user data across multiple tabs or windows can be a monumental task. Especially when it comes to recording and playback solutions, they are often confined to a single browser tab, making it impossible to properly capture these complex scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opkey automated engine navigates through multiple tabs and windows while maintaining test status and transferring test data. Even Opkey’s smart recorder can keep pace with these scenarios, letting you take advantage of both recording and playback approaches, even in the most difficult situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iFrames&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An iFrame is basically a web page within another web page. They are commonly used in more complex packaged applications such as Salesforce and SAP. Additionally, they are a popular way to embed third-party content (like advertisements) into a web page. Working with iFrames with Selenium is not an easy task. You need to create sound logic using code to select the right frame to interact with. Otherwise, Selenium will fail to find your locator because it is not looking for the right place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opkey’s Smart Test Builder can manage iFrames with ease. Just click on your test case normally as any user would, and Opkey’s smart test automation will handle all of the frame switching and complex logic creation for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opkey is uniquely qualified to automate dynamic Salesforce applications with its predictive autonomous testing platform. Key features include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zero-code Test builder–&lt;/strong&gt; Opkey’s zero-code test builder can easily handle dynamic objects and specific controls provide 70% faster test creation as compared to Selenium. The test builder is also updated continuously to be in sync with the latest Salesforce updates freeing you from all maintenance worries. &lt;br&gt;
Salesforce API testing– Opkey’s automation engine generates tests automatically for all your REST and SOAP services. It can automatically detect API endpoints for your salesforce org, ensuring 70% faster API test creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model-Based Testing approach–&lt;/strong&gt; With Opkey’s model-based testing approach you can easily create a model of your application with drag and drop canvas. Provides 50+ Pre-Built Salesforce model for the most comprehensive &lt;a href="https://www.opkey.com/salesforce/"&gt;Salesforce test automation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
End to end impact analysis– Based on risk-based testing, Opkey’s foresight solution gives you information on the scope of Salesforce testing after each update. The impact analysis feature identifies what exactly will break, and automatically updates your test scripts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and try the &lt;a href="https://www.opkey.com/"&gt;Opkey test automation platform&lt;/a&gt; for all your Salesforce testing worries.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How they made controls at Github?</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/kiranmantha/how-they-made-controls-at-github-1h18</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Did you observe the cover image of this article?? if yes, then that's the answer to this article's title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes github makes use of &lt;code&gt;details and summary&lt;/code&gt; html5 tags to create controls like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Episode1: Dropdown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Episode2: Modals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can treat this as television series but don't afraid this won't go forever like ever 😌. we got very few episodes that u can count using single hand 👏 😆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now in Episode1 let's see how they created a dropdown using details and summary tags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;let's create a basic details and summary structure:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;details&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;role=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'dropdown'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;I'm a dropdown&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/summary&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/details&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;if observed above snippet we're using &lt;code&gt;role&lt;/code&gt; attribute to define the usecase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the above snippet got rendered we just see an accordion with empty content. But a dropdown contains a list of options right let's add them&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;details&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;role=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'dropdown'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;I'm a dropdown&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/summary&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'1'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'radio'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'dropdown'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;for=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'1'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Option 1&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'2'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'radio'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'dropdown'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;for=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'2'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Option 2&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'3'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'radio'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'dropdown'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;for=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'3'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Option 3&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'4'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'radio'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'dropdown'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;for=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'4'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Option 4&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/details&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;great this will render an accordion with a list of 4 options with radio buttons. whenever you select an option, the previous selection is cleared because we make use of name attibute on radio button list. now let's style this as a dropdown.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight scss"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$padder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;.5rem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1rem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$trigger-border-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#ccc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$option-hover-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#eee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$chevron-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#3273dc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$checkmark-url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sx"&gt;url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='24' height='24' viewBox='0 0 24 24' fill='none' stroke='%23FFF' stroke-width='4' stroke-linecap='round' stroke-linejoin='round'%3E%3Cpolyline points='20 6 9 17 4 12'%3E%3C/polyline%3E%3C/svg%3E")&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$chevron-url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sx"&gt;url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='24' height='24' viewBox='0 0 24 24' fill='none' stroke='rgba(65, 84, 98, 0.999)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;' stroke-width='&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;' stroke-linecap='&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;round&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;' stroke-linejoin='&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;round&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'%3E%3Cpolyline points='&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'%3E%3C/polyline%3E%3C/svg%3E");&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;details[role='&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dropdown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'] {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    &amp;amp; &amp;gt; summary {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;      pointer-events: none;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;      color: rgba(16, 16, 16, 0.3);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;  }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;  &amp;amp; &amp;gt; summary {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    border-radius: 2px;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    &amp;amp;::-webkit-details-marker {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    &amp;amp;::after {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;      content: '';&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;  }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;excellent. we made an awesome dropdown. But there's an issue here. If you open the dropdown, whenever you click outside the dropdown should close which is not happening right now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The immediate solution which come across your mind is adding an event listener to window to close drodown. right?? But what if i say we don't have to use javascript to close the dropdown. Then what's the solution?? css. Yes we can leverage css to close dropdown when we click outside. lets's see how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the above scss snippet, add &lt;code&gt;before&lt;/code&gt; pseudo selector to &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;[open] &amp;gt; summary {...}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight scss"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;summary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="k"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;::before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;fixed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;bottom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;z-index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;80&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;cursor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;' '&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;transparent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That's it. we didn't use a single line of javascript code to create this dropdown. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can add checkboxes to convert this to multi-select dropdown. in &lt;code&gt;html&lt;/code&gt; snippet, convert radio buttons to checkboxes. but we need to add extra css to style the new layout. this is complete css for our dropdown:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight scss"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$padder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;.5rem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1rem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$trigger-border-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#ccc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$option-hover-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#eee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$chevron-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#3273dc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$checkmark-url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sx"&gt;url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='24' height='24' viewBox='0 0 24 24' fill='none' stroke='%23FFF' stroke-width='4' stroke-linecap='round' stroke-linejoin='round'%3E%3Cpolyline points='20 6 9 17 4 12'%3E%3C/polyline%3E%3C/svg%3E")&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$chevron-url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sx"&gt;url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='24' height='24' viewBox='0 0 24 24' fill='none' stroke='rgba(65, 84, 98, 0.999)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;' stroke-width='&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;' stroke-linecap='&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;round&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;' stroke-linejoin='&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;round&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'%3E%3Cpolyline points='&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'%3E%3C/polyline%3E%3C/svg%3E");&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;details[role='&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dropdown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'] {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;  }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;          margin-right: 4px;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;          display: inline-block;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;          width: 20px;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;          height: 20px;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;          background-color: #fff;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;          border: 1px solid;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;          vertical-align: text-bottom;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;        }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;        &amp;amp;:checked + label:before {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;          background-image: $checkmark-url;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;          background-repeat: no-repeat;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;          background-position: center;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;          background-size: calc(1rem * 0.8) auto;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;          background-color: $chevron-color;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;          border: 1px solid $chevron-color;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;        }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;      }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;      label {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;        cursor: pointer;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;        color: inherit;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;        display: block;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;        position: relative;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;        padding: $padder;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;        border-left: 3px solid transparent;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;        white-space: nowrap;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;        &amp;amp;:hover {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;          background-color: $option-hover-color;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;        }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;      }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;  }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Awesome 😍 we created a dropdown out of html and css. But..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 2 caveats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have to maually close the dropdown when we are using this dropdown for single select. Whenever an option is selected, then remove &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; attribute on details tag using &lt;code&gt;detailsTag.removeAttribute('open')&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;update the &lt;code&gt;summary&lt;/code&gt; tag text when an option is selected or comma seperated options in case of multi-select.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how Github make use of details and summary tag for dropdown and that's the end of this episode. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the working example &lt;a href="https://stackblitz.com/edit/web-platform-vz6n19?file=index.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#endtitles"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  EndTitles
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you know there is a very small css library(~10kb) which helps us in getting freedom from the clutches of remembering &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; number of helper classes just to design your layout?? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if not then, welcome to &lt;a href="https://picocss.com/"&gt;PicoCSS&lt;/a&gt;. Just write semantic html for your layout and leave the rest to PicoCSS. It comes with built-in responsive layouts and light/dark modes. I raised a &lt;a href="https://github.com/picocss/pico/pull/86"&gt;PR&lt;/a&gt; for above dropdown implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not mentioning this library because i raised a PR but i love how the contributors make leverage of html5 and css to create awesome layouts. Go ahead and check their docs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile bring out your thoughts on how we can change the position of dropdown if it is out of viewport and post your solutions in comments section below. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you in next episode. Thanks..&lt;br&gt;
Kiran 👋&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Good Bye console.log,no console.log in 2022</title>
      <author>SHIVANSH PATEL</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2021 06:30:06 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/imshivanshpatel/good-bye-consolelogno-consolelog-in-2022-1foc</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/imshivanshpatel/good-bye-consolelogno-consolelog-in-2022-1foc</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;yes you heard it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we frequently use &lt;strong&gt;console.log()&lt;/strong&gt; to check our outputs in console, it's ok in Development mode but it is highly disgraced in production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so then what's the solution for it.so in production we basically use production grade loggers.This article is going to teach you how to use &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ps-logger"&gt;ps-logger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q.Why ps-logger ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
=&amp;gt;yes you have &lt;strong&gt;few&lt;/strong&gt; other options but the problem is that you have to do lots of manual configurations in it.That's why beginners don't even touch production grade loggers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ps-logger"&gt;ps-logger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a plug and play logger.There is no manual configurations.you have to just install and use it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm i ps-logger
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example:-
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;ps-logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;This is info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;warn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;This is warning&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;This is error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;debug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;This is debug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;prompt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;This is prompt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;verbose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;This is verbose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;silly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;This is silly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_u0PdjcD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4n7u5kg64veijm949bxc.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_u0PdjcD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4n7u5kg64veijm949bxc.PNG" alt="ps-logger" width="544" height="215"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you want to disable its colors
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;in future updates it will provide more features to you guys&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mastering on flex-basis behaviour</title>
      <author>⚡Preethi</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2021 06:25:57 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/preethi_dev/mastering-on-flex-basis-behaviour-56a2</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/preethi_dev/mastering-on-flex-basis-behaviour-56a2</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey Gang, Feel lucky to see you again. when start to learning on flexbox, feel like the least well-explained property in Flexbox tutorials. start to getting confused😥 like what exactly &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; behavior?? what's the difference between &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt;?? etc.,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uh, increase our frustartion rate right. After reading lots of blog and did some exprimentation. Finally grasped the answer for all question🎉🎉. Then I'm get ready to make you mastering on &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; behaviour and let's get this show on the road. So, Be feel like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--a6cOaC_h--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gxj5yoe0n9lrjytcffv0.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--a6cOaC_h--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gxj5yoe0n9lrjytcffv0.gif" alt="Image description" width="498" height="460"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before understanding of &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt;. Need to aware of &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Main axis&lt;/b&gt; of flexbox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flex items formula&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Main axis of flexbox&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If &lt;code&gt;flex-direction: row&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;flex-direction: row-reverse&lt;/code&gt;, your &lt;code&gt;main-axis&lt;/code&gt; will run left to right or right to left of the page in the inline direction (horizontally).
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--j86F582n--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5h5wywuoo7cb5xntqasu.png" alt="Image description" width="522" height="152"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If &lt;code&gt;flex-direction: column&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;flex-direction: column-reverse&lt;/code&gt;, your &lt;code&gt;main-axis&lt;/code&gt; will run top to bottom or bottom to top of the page in the block direction (vertically).
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PyWG99nM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x9liam9aifn9hf5jt977.png" alt="Image description" width="709" height="227"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Flex item formula&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flex item(which means elements inside the flex container) following specific formula,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vQPLtTDH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vuvya31pioueoctmf15b.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vQPLtTDH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vuvya31pioueoctmf15b.png" alt="Image description" width="520" height="143"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Which conveys that,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If no &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;flex-basis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is specified, then the &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; falls back to the item's &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; property.&lt;br&gt;
If no &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; is specified, then the &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; falls back to the computed width of the item's contents&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;flex-basis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The default value of &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;b&gt;auto&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; take an element’s size across the main axis. which means,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if &lt;code&gt;flex-direction&lt;/code&gt; will be &lt;b&gt;row&lt;/b&gt; and flex-basis is 250px, then main axis is in inline direction(horizontally) and it take 250px in &lt;b&gt;width&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if &lt;code&gt;flex-direction&lt;/code&gt; will be &lt;b&gt;column&lt;/b&gt; and flex-basis is 250px, then main axis is in block direction(vertically) and it take 250px in &lt;b&gt;height&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you get my point😍. If can't, don't worry. You can understood through below example,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--acEfPqjj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i51kmnwotu59f2nefv81.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--acEfPqjj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i51kmnwotu59f2nefv81.gif" alt="Image description" width="800" height="295"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 if &lt;code&gt;flex-direction&lt;/code&gt; will be &lt;b&gt;row&lt;/b&gt; and flex-basis is 160px, then main axis is in inline direction(horizontally) and it take 160px in &lt;b&gt;width&lt;/b&gt;. If we change the flex direction to &lt;b&gt;column&lt;/b&gt;, then main axis is in block direction(vertically) and it take 160px in &lt;b&gt;height&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;code&gt;Flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; thus alternately determines width or height, depending on &lt;code&gt;flex-direction&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Seems like &lt;b&gt;dynamic&lt;/b&gt; in nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend you to practice in codpen like just swtich the &lt;code&gt;flex-direction&lt;/code&gt; and see the effect lively..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/preethi-dev/embed/bGoLOqe?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey, Still with me🥳. I can understood, You are getting very curious about &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; behaviour. So, It's my pleasure to show you &lt;b&gt;4 key behaviours of flex-basis&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4 key behaviours of flex-basis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; controls either “&lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt;” or “&lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt;” based on the &lt;code&gt;flex-direction&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; will override any other &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt; properties if specifically declared anything other than &lt;code&gt;flex-basis: auto;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; will still obey &lt;code&gt;min-width&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;max-width&lt;/code&gt; or height settings, which is based on &lt;code&gt;flex-direction&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; is set to &lt;b&gt;auto&lt;/b&gt;, it first checks for a &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt; property (based on direction) if none, it uses the elements content sizing.(just remember that flex-item formula &lt;b&gt;content &amp;lt;- width &amp;lt;- flex-basis&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; is: the size of flex items before they are placed into a flex container(which means before the flex-shrink or flex-grow getting applied). &lt;b&gt;It's the ideal or hypothetical size of the items&lt;/b&gt;. After placing the flex item in flex container, things may getting changed based on flex container size. Because flex container won't have enough space(&lt;code&gt;flex-shrink&lt;/code&gt; start to shrinking the items), or will have extra space(&lt;code&gt;flex-grow&lt;/code&gt; start to growing the items).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;uh😅, &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; guy have so much of behaviour and Congratulations,You reached the destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nVRbKW5M--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h9dbaimtu10jph7n1455.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nVRbKW5M--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h9dbaimtu10jph7n1455.gif" alt="Image description" width="498" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please execuse me, I will end up with a bonus info.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;A best practice is to just use flex-basis instead of width or height&lt;/b&gt;. Especially since Safari still has an old flexbox bug where it won't apply flex-shrink properly to items that use height instead of flex-basis&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If i continue now, which make you feel overwhelmed😥. &lt;b&gt;So, If you feel need live example for key behaviours of flex-basis and just drop a comment &lt;/b&gt;which make a way to know about your thought and I will start to build part-2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you loved this blog, Then give an endearing heart💝and drop your thought about this blog😍 which really a lot to me. I love the discussion with you, If you feel not comfortable at styling concepts or have any doubts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for Reading!!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Preethi&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey there! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm mixing up this week's win thread in honor of the upcoming new year (for those cultures that recognize the New Year as beginning this upcoming Saturday, that is). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of looking back on our weeks, what would you say your biggest win was for this past YEAR? What are you proud of having accomplished?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All wins count — big or "small" 🎉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of 2021 'wins' include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting a new job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning to value your personal strengths &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking more time off to unplug with loved ones regularly ... or whatever else might have sparked joy and purpose ❤️ &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Congrats on your accomplishments in 2021! You're amazing 🌠 &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introduction to Asynchronous Processing and Message Queues</title>
      <author>Apoorv Tyagi</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2021 06:08:46 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/apoorvtyagi/introduction-to-asynchronous-processing-and-message-queues-27od</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/apoorvtyagi/introduction-to-asynchronous-processing-and-message-queues-27od</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a client-server architecture, the client can request a job to be done from the server by sending messages between each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Handling this communication can increase in complexity when you begin to manage the rate at which messages are sent, the number of requests a server can handle, or the response time which the client demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog, we'll see one way to handle this intricacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-synchronous-processing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Synchronous Processing?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In synchronous processing, a client sends a request to the server and waits for the server to complete its job and send back the response before the client can resume doing any other work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process is often referred to as a &lt;em&gt;blocking&lt;/em&gt; request as the client gets blocked from doing any other work until a response is received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GNhszEDd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640532456293/NNIoKI1h2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GNhszEDd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640532456293/NNIoKI1h2.png" alt="image.png" width="875" height="587"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-asynchronous-processing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Asynchronous Processing?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asynchronous processing is the exact opposite of synchronous processing. Here, the client doesn't wait for a response after sending a request to the server and continues doing any other work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process is referred to as a &lt;em&gt;non-blocking&lt;/em&gt; request as the execution thread of the client is not blocked. This allows systems to scale as more work can be done in a given amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#synchronous-vs-asynchronous-processing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Synchronous vs Asynchronous Processing
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synchronous requests block the execution thread of the client, forcing them to wait for the response to come before they can perform another action. On the other hand, asynchronous requests do not block and allow for more work to be done in a given time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since we do not know much time the request will take, it is difficult to build responsive applications with synchronous processing. The more blocking operations, the slower system becomes. With asynchronous processing, response time is quick as the client does not have to wait on the request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fault tolerance of asynchronous processing is higher than that of synchronous processing, as it is easy to build a retry mechanism when a request fails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wN6DiVmG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640532560708/lA0pdjuge.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wN6DiVmG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640532560708/lA0pdjuge.png" alt="image.png" width="450" height="253"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-are-message-queues"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What are Message Queues?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A message queue is a component that buffers requests from one service and broadcasts asynchronously to another service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, clients are the message producers, who send request messages to the queue instead of any server. They get an acknowledgment when the message is added to the queue, which enables them to continue with their other jobs without having to wait for the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Servers are known as message consumers and are served these messages from the queue based on the number of requests they can serve at any given time. This continues until all the messages in the queue have been served.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two most common messaging queues are — &lt;a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/"&gt;RabbitMQ&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://kafka.apache.org/"&gt;Kafka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#structure-of-message-queues"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Structure of Message Queues
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A message queue is primarily a broker of messages between message producers and message consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each distinct entity in the messaging queue setup (producers, consumers, and queue) has a responsibility and they're decoupled from each other as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only contract between all entities is the messages for which the message queue facilitates the movement from producers to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following sections, we will discuss the responsibilities of each component and look at the various modes with which the message queue delivers a message to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#message-producers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Message Producers
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Message producers initiate the asynchronous processing request. Producers have a responsibility to generate a valid message and publish it to the message queue. Messages submitted to the queue are then queued up and delivered to consumers to be processed asynchronously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Producers communicate with message queues using the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#message-brokers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Message Brokers
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A message broker is simply just a queue. You can even implement a simple broker programmatically that buffers messages and sends them to consumers as and when needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Message brokers are the actual decoupling elements in the setup, sitting between and managing the process of communication between producers and consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of their simplicity, brokers are optimized for high concurrency and throughput.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that adding message brokers introduces an extra layer of complexity into your infrastructure and requires you to scale them as well. Brokers also have specific requirements and limitations when it comes to scalability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#message-consumers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Message Consumers
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main responsibility of consumers is to receive and process messages from the queue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most consumers are API services that perform that actual asynchronous processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumers can be implemented in different application languages or technologies and maintained independently from other components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve decoupling, consumers should know nothing about the producers. The only contract that should exist between the two is valid messages from the queue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When properly decoupled, consumers can serve as independent service layers that can be used by both the message queue setup and other components in your infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#consumer-communication-strategies"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Consumer Communication Strategies
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Message queues need to transmit messages down to consumers, depending on how application developers implement consumers, message queues have three distinct ways of delivering messages to the consumers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Pull Model&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this model, the consumer periodically checks the status of the queue. This is done at a scheduled interval programmed on the side of the consumer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are messages found in the queue, the consumer picks them up until there are no more messages left to process, or when the 'N' number of messages has been consumed. This 'N' can be configured on the message broker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Push Model&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a message is added, the consumer is notified and the message is then pushed down to it. Messages are pushed down to consumers at a rate at which the consumer can easily regulate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Subscription Model&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this model, consumers can subscribe to a topic. This publisher publishes a message to a topic rather than a queue. Each consumer connected to the broker maintains its private queue to receive messages from topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the consumers subscribe to the topics and when a message is published to that topic, the message is cloned for each subscriber and added to the consumer’s private queue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#comparing-different-message-brokers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Comparing Different Message Brokers
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we have seen above, for asynchronous communication we usually need a message broker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are the few considerations you have to look at when choosing a broker for managing your asynchronous operations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Scale&lt;/strong&gt;: The number of messages sent per second in the system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Data Persistency&lt;/strong&gt;: The capability to recover messages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Consumer Capability&lt;/strong&gt;:  The capability to manage one-to-one / one-to-many consumers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#rabbitmq"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  RabbitMQ
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Scale: Based on configuration and resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Persistency: Both persistent and transient messages are supported.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  One-to-one vs One-to-many consumers: Both.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RabbitMQ supports all major languages, including Python, Java, .NET, PHP, Ruby, JavaScript, Go, Swift, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#kafka"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Kafka
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Scale: Can send up to a million messages per second.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Persistency: Yes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  One-to-one vs One-to-many consumers: Only one-to-many&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kafka has managed SaaS on both Azure and AWS. Kafka also supports all major languages, including Python, Java, C/C++, Clojure, .NET, PHP, Ruby, JavaScript, Go, Swift, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#redis"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Redis
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Scale: Can send up to a million messages per second.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Persistency: Not supported (it’s an in-memory database).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  One-to-one vs One-to-many consumers: Both.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Redis is a bit different from the other message brokers. Redis is an in-memory data store. Originally, Redis only supported one-to-one communication with consumers. However, since Redis 5.0 introduced the pub-sub, you can have one-to-many as another option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog, we covered how asynchronous processing is advantageous over its counterparts and how a message queue helps us achieve asynchronous processing along with keeping the different entities in its setup decoupled from each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also covered some basic characteristics of the most commonly used message brokers: Redis, Kafka, and RabbitMQ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a bit more detailed instruction for selecting the right message broker to use according to different use cases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short-lived Messages: Redis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Redis is good for short-lived messages where persistence isn’t required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Large Amounts of Data: Kafka&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Kafka is good for storing a large amount of data for long periods. Kafka is also ideal for one-to-many use cases where persistency is required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complex Routing: RabbitMQ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  RabbitMQ is good for complex routing communication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
