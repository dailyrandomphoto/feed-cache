      <title>Dealing with discomfort. Change.</title>
      <author>Holger Blank</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Mar 2021 13:51:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/s2engineers/dealing-with-discomfort-change-3boo</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/s2engineers/dealing-with-discomfort-change-3boo</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I rarely, if ever, talk or write about my personal journey in public. Mainly because I feel uncomfortable while doing so. Time to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my time as a co-organizer of tech-community events  like &lt;a href="https://jsconf.eu"&gt;JSConf EU&lt;/a&gt; and others for the last 10+ years I had the opportunity to listen and learn a lot. But as I figured out really soon, I also had the need to learn a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It hasn't been that one single event that helped me to see the undeniable structural facts of our unequal society and workplaces around me. I learned, slowly, over years. I was able to see things clearer over time. Most of the time I felt uncomfortable with a lot of things I've seen and learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my personal journey, as a highly privileged white-male, I was lucky to have a group of people around me that helped me to reflect the situation, making me feel uncomfortable, developing my views including also co-creating small things that hopefully made a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I'm glad that the team I'm working with most of the time, is not only incredibly open for change but also drives a lot of change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raffaele (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pixari"&gt;@pixari&lt;/a&gt;) from our Munich based team wrote an incredible article about his journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest spending 11 minutes reading that one (not only) to every of my male colleagues. I also propose to spend many more minutes following all the links he has collected.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag__link"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="/s2engineers/step-up-listen-up-shut-up-50ca" class="ltag__link__link"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ltag__link__content"&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;Step up. Listen up. Shut up.&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;Raffaele Pizzari ・ Mar  3 ・ 11 min read&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;div class="ltag__link__taglist"&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#shecodedally&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#genderequality&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#womensrights&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#choosetochallenge&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The next post I recommend reading is from Feli (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kotzendekrabbe"&gt;@kotzendekrabbe&lt;/a&gt;). Feli and me first met at JSConf EU 2015, since 2016 we're working together. Since then, Feli made me feel uncomfortable more than once. I'm thankful for every single time!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="/s2engineers/nevertheless-feli-coded-choosetochallenge-yourself-4enn" class="ltag__link__link"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ltag__link__content"&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;Nevertheless, Feli Coded - ChooseToChallenge Yourself&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;Feli (she/her) ・ Mar  4 ・ 3 min read&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;div class="ltag__link__taglist"&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#shecoded&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#womenintech&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#choosetochallenge&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#career&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Becoming uncomfortable is always my starting point for change. And it could become yours too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest not only to allow others to make you feel uncomfortable, but creating a culture where everybody is aware of their unearned privileges and is fostering a culture where being confronted is valued as a joint and common starting point of change.&lt;/p&gt;

  My name is just Sharon, I do not have any nicknames(at least that I know of)
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#where-do-you-work" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Where do you work?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B. Braun Group &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-do-you-do" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What do you do?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work as an Innovation and Business Development Manager at B. Braun Group, a healthcare company that manufactures medical devices and solutions. My job entails identifying internal and external innovative ideas which we can develop into new products to protect and improve the health of people across the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#who-or-what-inspired-you-to-pursue-the-career-you-have-today" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Who or what inspired you to pursue the career you have today?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My high school Physics teacher inspired me to study engineering at the University. Since then, I've had an incredibly supportive network of mentors who have influenced the changes in my career path to what I'm doing today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-your-favourite-music-genre" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is your favourite music genre?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My playlist has a little bit of everything - from Jazz to traditional Luhya music. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  what is your secret talent that no one knows about?

&lt;p&gt;Knitting and Crocheting &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-advice-for-allies-to-support-underrepresented-folks-who-code-is" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My advice for allies to support underrepresented folks who code is...
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, never stop learning. Stay curious and updated in your field.&lt;br&gt;
Second, it is okay to have a non-linear career path. Keep an open mind and always be on the look out for new opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-do-you-keep-yourself-up-to-date-in-your-field" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How do you keep yourself up to date in your field?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read - a lot! &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  How would you describe your job to a bunch of 5 year olds
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find new companies which can be friends with my company, and we can all play together and make cool products that help sick people feel better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-cool-thing-are-you-working-on-right-now" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What cool thing are you working on right now?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm currently supporting the roll out of our new company strategy. It's exciting to see how a company that was founded over 180 years ago is adopting new technology and preparing for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-was-your-first-job" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What was your first job?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was an ICT4D Intern at a Community Knowledge Centre. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-are-the-toughest-challenges-youve-had-at-work" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What are the toughest challenges you've had at work?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overcoming Imposter Syndrome and learning to negotiate and advocate for myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-upcoming-technological-innovation-will-dramatically-impact-the-industry-in-the-next-five-years" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What upcoming technological innovation will dramatically impact the industry in the next five years?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artificial Intelligence and Robotics are dramatically changing the Healthcare industry, from enabling early detection to AI-assisted surgeries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-skill-do-you-think-everyone-should-learn" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What skill do you think everyone should learn?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hard to pick one - but I'd say everyone needs to pay as much attention to their soft skills as they do to their technical skills. Emotional intelligence, great communication skills and creative problem solving skills will get you very far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#have-you-taken-a-huge-leap-of-faith-at-work-did-it-pay-off" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Have you taken a huge leap of faith at work? Did it pay off?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes I have. I quit my job to move to a new country for a 1 year fellowship program that had no guaranteed future after that. It did pay off. I experienced a lot of growth over the one year, and the work that I did during the fellowship built a foundation for a new job with the same company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-can-we-follow-you" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How can we follow you?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am Founder/CEO of GlobalX Investments/GlobalX Innovation Labs based in Nairobi, Kenya.  GlobalX's vision is to drive a more diverse, inclusive and competitive digital economy with a focus on emerging technologies, that opens up equal opportunities for all.

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Who or what inspired you to pursue the career you have today?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love working in tech because first, I like to make positive impact in society through innovations. Secondly, I get bored easily, so I like to do stuff that keeps me engaged and allows me to try different things, discover and keep learning. Being in tech allows me to do this. I always look forward to creating or being part of teams that create solutions for humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

  What is the best advice you can give to someone who just started their career?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believe in yourself and seek all the support you require to succeed, but you must be ready to knock many doors.&lt;/p&gt;

  How would you describe your job to a bunch of 5 year olds
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you heard of, seen, built or learnt how to build robots? Coded using scratch? Heard of, seen or built a drone or best still flown one? My work involves helping build or giving guidance/teaching individuals or companies to build or do these type of things. My work also involves helping people who create these things start/run businesses, just like the shopkeeper where you buy bread from runs their shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  What cool thing are you working on right now?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am working on an initiative that aims to increase the representation of women in Artificial Intelligence. This was born out of my participation in the ITCILO AI Lab between Aug-Nov 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-was-your-first-job" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What was your first job?

  &lt;/a&gt;
  What are the toughest challenges you've had at work?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being able to fund/get adequate resources for some initiatives I am passionate about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-upcoming-technological-innovation-will-dramatically-impact-the-industry-in-the-next-five-years" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What upcoming technological innovation will dramatically impact the industry in the next five years?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artificial Intelligence (AI)-related innovations are definitely the industry game changer. It is estimated that by 2030, AI will contribute $15.7 Trillion to the global GDP, making it the biggest commercial opportunity in today’s fast changing economy. AI basically refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving. From disease mapping and prediction tools; song or TV show recommendations from Spotify and Netflix; conversational bots for customer support and marketing; to delivery of blood to remote locations that would be typically hard-to-reach, AI has definitely had a major contribution so far and continues to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-skill-do-you-think-everyone-should-learn" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What skill do you think everyone should learn?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public Speaking&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#have-you-taken-a-huge-leap-of-faith-at-work-did-it-pay-off" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Have you taken a huge leap of faith at work? Did it pay off?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes I have-getting into entrepreneurship. It has paid off especially in terms of impact, growing my professional brand as well as making me learn about myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A guy named Arthur Kennedy is the who introduced me to coding and opened up my mind about technology. His patience and brilliance made me want to be more like him. I am really grateful to him for that and the amazing ladies from Rails Girls Mombasa and Nairobi who we not only gave each other hope in our coding journey but took up the challenge to teach and inspire others.&lt;/p&gt;

  My advice for allies to support underrepresented folks who code is...
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't be afraid, allow yourself to make mistakes that is how you learn, ask the dumb questions and be very patient with yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  How do you keep yourself up to date in your field?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to read tech blogs, follow tech blogs on twitter, I recently started picking coding challenges on exercism and hackerrank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-would-you-describe-your-job-to-a-bunch-of-5-year-olds" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How would you describe your job to a bunch of 5 year olds
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the apps you use on the internet? I build those😎.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-cool-thing-are-you-working-on-right-now" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What cool thing are you working on right now?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently worked on implementing a feature that allows you to link your your forms from ona to Tableau for visualization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-was-your-first-job" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What was your first job?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does an intern count? I am currently at my first job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-are-the-toughest-challenges-youve-had-at-work" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What are the toughest challenges you've had at work?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started out as an intern, I had to learn a new language within the three months. It was also my first time working on code that goes to production. It was the toughest yet the best experience ever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-upcoming-technological-innovation-will-dramatically-impact-the-industry-in-the-next-five-years" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What upcoming technological innovation will dramatically impact the industry in the next five years?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe machine learning and robotics is something people will  embrace even more. 2020 has made us realize we don't really need to be at the same place to get things done therefore dependence on machines will increase as we move forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-skill-do-you-think-everyone-should-learn" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What skill do you think everyone should learn?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;critical thinking. You might be a good developer but if you can't think how to implement your code, you will stay at the same place. As my mentor says, coding is easy as long as you know what you are coding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#have-you-taken-a-huge-leap-of-faith-at-work-did-it-pay-off" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Have you taken a huge leap of faith at work? Did it pay off?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think pick up features or new technologies at work is always a leap of faith for me. Sometimes I might take longer to even deliver but my end goal is not to just complete but to come out better and with knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

  My name is just Celine, I do not have any nicknames(at least that I know of)
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#where-do-you-work" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Where do you work?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am an incoming software engineer at Slack. Will be working on the front-end. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-do-you-do" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What do you do?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a software engineer. I am also a you-tuber and make tech content specifically. I also write about technology, most especially software engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#who-or-what-inspired-you-to-pursue-the-career-you-have-today" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Who or what inspired you to pursue the career you have today?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always been fascinated by tech ever since I was a kid. I particularly chose to pursue a software engineering career because I loved how it gave me the opportunity to solve problems as well as create things that are important for humanity. I also love how versatile my career is, especially because I am that person who enjoys exploring new things, hence as a software engineer, I  am able to do a lot of different things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-your-favourite-music-genre" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is your favourite music genre?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love Afro beats, I listen to bongo a lot. Lately started listening to 'Amapiano'.  We can say that I listen to a lot of African music&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be open to learning. Learning is something that is never ending in life and being open to it will for sure open a lot of opportunities for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  What cool thing are you working on right now?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I am excited about finally launching  a program that I have always wanted to start. It will be a mentor-ship program for women in stem. I have always wanted to empower other women and it means a lot to me that I am finally going to be able to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-was-your-first-job" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What was your first job?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worked as a student library assistant&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think learning how to code is fundamental, especially with how the world is quickly become technologically oriented&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. I had a Perl web scraper that I needed to update. It was old, ugly, messy. It used xml and wsdl, which I hadn't worked with before. But it really helped me understand a lot and learn a new language&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy International Women's Day!✨💖👯&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-most-recent-achievement-was" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My most recent achievement was…
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dream goal. One of the reasons I work in tech is because it allows us to work remotely easily. Last year, I got my first full remote position - which is my third and current job. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I very appreciate the company value non-technical expertise and people skills just as highly as technical expertise. The job was challenging from the beginning but I've learned so much there. If I hadn't been given the opportunity, I wouldn't have all that valuable experience behind me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#advocating-for-myself-looks-like" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Advocating for myself looks like…
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first would be allowing myself to take a break and rest. Next would be knowing I have a lot to learn and take it one step at a time. I've also learned to make sure I am comfortable with being uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-biggest-goal-is" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My biggest goal is…
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am keen to help inspire women from non-tech backgrounds to get into tech. It was really encouraging for me to see women from all kinds of backgrounds who didn’t have a Computer Science degree like me to work in the tech industry. And I always believe there were transferable skills between each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-advice-for-allies-to-support-underrepresented-folks-who-code-is" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My advice for allies to support underrepresented folks who code is...
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always be kind and support them in every possible way🌻 Be proud of what you achieved and learned in a time even if it is just a small thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have grown so much as a woman and a developer and I am still working on it but despite everything, nevertheless, I coded. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Dev.to, for the extra step of having someone reading the #shecoded posts and inspired other women through women's stories.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>To All of My Talented Sisters</title>
      <author>Negar</author>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;"Why shouldn't I give it a try?" I wonder, sitting in the living room four years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing up, I always had huge dreams about my future, from being a superhero to becoming an astronaut. Hopefully, my parents never stopped me from dreaming big and never question any of my goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But around age 22, in the middle of my plan for becoming an astrophysicist at the physics faculty, I realized that this is not a job that makes me want to wake up every day and go back to work. I was feeling like that I had a plan for my life for years and now I am lost. I have always been the girl with the plan since I was 6 and now the same person didn't even know what should she do after graduation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was almost 4 years ago when my friend sent me a photo of a girl who was working as a developer and said "Look how successful she is!", that one picture made me wonder "Why shouldn't I give it a try?".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always been into technology. Ever since I've got my very first computer I couldn't get my hands off it. Even when I should study for my exams I rather read the book from the PDF instead of the physical book, just because then I didn't have to leave my computer. But programming was never something for me to think of. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The summer after my graduation I registered for a short frontend Bootcamp. Compared to the others in the same class I was one of the people with the least related background knowledge. I was scared and fragile. Compared to a person with a programming degree, I was lacking 4 years of studying. With all of that fears and doubts, I kept my mind open and gave all of my attention to the courses. Sometimes, I found myself opening the 20th browser tab to search for the meaning of another new concept just to be able to read an article to the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nine months later I found my very first job as a Frontend developer with HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, and Bootstrap on my skillset in my resume. I remember promising my employer in the interview that I won't be the same person in two months due to all the new things that would learn. I stood by my words and in two years of working in that team, I never let them down with anything that was assigned to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--C8FQrcic--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qqpdrjpfq74wacv1mjiq.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--C8FQrcic--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qqpdrjpfq74wacv1mjiq.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I start writing articles and making videos in my free time to share my knowledge as little as it was with the new fellow developers to help them have fewer struggles at the beginning of the road. With all the supports and encouragement that I've got from people online, there were always a few destructive comments, making fun of the simplicity of the topics or accusing me to get attention &lt;strong&gt;just because I am a girl&lt;/strong&gt;, not that I am doing anything valuable. I have to confess that some of these comments dissipate my motivation for showing up and providing more content for a while. But then I've learned no matter how experienced and professional you are, there are always some people feeling insecure about your growth and try to feel better by making you feel insecure on some levels. The best reaction to these destructive behaviors is to keep moving on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past four years, I've learned that you never know everything and you never have all the answers, even if you have all the degrees and experiences. I've learned that tools and frameworks can be learned in two months but what you need years of experience are the fundamentals that happen to seem less important and useful. I've learned that sometimes your soft skills, morals, and communications are more important factors to make you a valuable employee for a good company than the number of programming languages that you have mastered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month I proudly had a talk at the &lt;a href="https://frontenddeveloperlove.com/"&gt;JS World Conference&lt;/a&gt;, one of the conferences that I have always been dreaming about. And when it was happening it didn't seem like a dream anymore; It was reality, and it was achievable. I still have my doubts and fears when it comes to doing the things that I have never done, but from the bottom of my heart, I know that all the dreams can become reality, and then they won't seem impossible anymore. There is no such thing as a superhero because everyone can achieve anything, they just need to keep on trying and take a new step forward once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-journey-is-not-a-linear-path" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My journey is not a linear path
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My journey into tech has been a long winded process of finding myself and my own voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I graduated with a Pharmacology degree and worked as a Research Lab Scientist for 3 years. In those 3 years, I wanted to pursue PhD because I love research and data. I had a change of heart when I realised I didn’t want to spend the next 20 to 30 years going into the lab, putting on my white coat, experimenting both &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. I wanted to be creative but yet utilise my love for problem solving and learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left the field when I was diagnosed with endometriosis. The pain I experienced as a woman during ovulation and menstruation was unbearable. It took 3 years for that diagnosis, I spent those time in the lab and I think that was one of the deciding factors that I wanted to work in tech because there is a greater flexibility in working conditions, I could work with my laptop and tend to myself when I experience pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined a coding Bootcamp under apprenticeship - I went for an interview with a small BI company and I was really excited because I could possibly combine software engineering and data. I started the Bootcamp. I learnt a lot in 12 weeks but looking back, the learning style was a lot of ticking boxes and I wanted to go deeper into the subjects. I joined the company but I was the only developer with no outline of the projects I should be working on and was told to work on sales consultancy support. I was misled but I spent the whole time, hoping or wishing that there would be a project where I could utilise my skills but this never came. I quit after 2 and the half months for various reasons. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first job in tech set me back and I was left questioning my ability and whether or not a hostile and unsupportive work environment is the norm in tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I passed my Microsoft exam, quit my job and found out I was expecting. That was a lot of emotions in less than a month - happiness, excitement, anxiousness, self-deprecation and a whole lot more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was anxious about the pregnancy and what my future in tech will be. Will I have a second chance at it? Will I be able to reboot my career in tech? Am I capable of being a software engineer? Will I be ok taking a career break?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#fast-forward-20-months-later" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Fast forward 20 months later
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent my time during pregnancy dipping in and out playing around with Gatsby, coming up with project ideas that didn’t get executed and creating learning tracker and plans so I could use it after the birth of my baby. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t get to work on any projects or learning while I saw other new mums thriving in their learning with a young baby. I blamed myself for not being disciplined but the truth was, motherhood was not natural to me and I suffered with postpartum anxiety. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that my little one is 12 months old, I have learnt so much about motherhood and myself thus far - it taught me to be kind to myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am now hopeful for my future with my family by my side, friends who lift me up and supportive communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My recent achievements look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I found supportive moms-in-tech Slack group and Virtual Coffee community. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I created my &lt;a href="//www.cristien.xyz"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; to document my learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s okay to have a multitude of interests from design, web dev, data and machine learning (I tend to talk myself down for not being able to narrow my interests to one thing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was recently awarded a Bank of America scholarship to study Python with Code First Girls and currently enrolled in the evening classes for a month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have also accepted into Front End Foxes School - European region cohort 🦊 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allowing myself to take a break and rest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking kindly to myself when I don’t achieve what I need to achieve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I’ve learnt so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you have to be put in challenging situations to be true to yourself and speak up about what you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I quit my first job in tech because I wasn’t going to let myself be treated unkindly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I stopped coding for a bit because my family is my priority and fertility is not something I’m going to take for granted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I am back to code consistently and this time, with self-compassion and a sprinkle of self-belief that I can achieve my dream goal: to land a remote Software Engineering or Data Scientist role this year within an inclusive, supportive company who I can contribute my skills to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have grown so much as a woman and a developer who have struggled to find my voice. I am still work in progress but despite everything, nevertheless I coded. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy International Women’s Day!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After seeing the initiative that DEV is proposing for such a special day as 8 March, I didn't want to miss it, so I'm joining in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-biggest-achievement-this-year" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My biggest achievement this year
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, after the best professional year of my life, I decided to try my luck and try to join the company I loved, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/passionatepeoplenl/"&gt;Passionate People&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are not going to deny that I still have insecurities after 5 years in this sector, but what I see as important is that they do not stop me from pursuing my goals or my dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many times you have to do things that you don't feel capable of, like trying to get into the company of your dreams, but if you try, you will get there, so don't give up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here I am... 😱&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#women-in-tech-who-have-appeared-in-my-life" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Women in tech who have appeared in my life
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said, last year was completely crazy for me, for all the goals I achieved, for everything I accomplished in my working life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I owe it all to many women in this sector, for their support, for their help, for their strength and for making a place for us in places we were not part of!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I have to name someone first, it has to be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/debs_obrien"&gt;Debbie O'brien&lt;/a&gt;, we can say that Debbie is my shadow manager 🤣 She has been a crucial person in my life this last year, she has helped me to grow, to make an effort, to value what I do and above all to believe in myself, in my knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone told me a year and a half ago that Debbie would talk to me in a video call I would faint (she was like a divine being for me hahahaha)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another person who inspires me the most is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lauragift_"&gt;Gift Egwuenu&lt;/a&gt; how she manages to do everything she sets out to do, being everywhere and having time to cook, dance and go for a run, she is a superheroine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And my partner in crime &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/miriamgonp"&gt;Miriam Gonzalez&lt;/a&gt; could not be missing in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that the tech community has brought me is the opportunity to meet other people in online events during this year of confinement. One of them is Miriam, who is now a very important pillar, with whom I am setting up projects that make me live again a little and remember what it was like to have a laugh with friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to meeting more women in tech and joining forces 🤗&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-biggest-goal-for-this-year" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My biggest goal for this year
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contribute more to open source, encourage more women in the sector to participate, increase the female open source community, like &lt;a href="https://www.vuevixens.org/"&gt;Frontend Foxes&lt;/a&gt; has done for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to be able to mentor a woman who wants to enter in the Frontend world would also be awesome 🤩&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-advice-for-allies-to-support-underrepresented-folks-who-code" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My advice for allies to support underrepresented folks who code
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't turn a blind eye when a colleague is undervalued by their superiors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be human, if someone makes a mistake, don't whip them, remind them that we all make mistakes, that we are improving and learning thanks to having made them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Respect the speed of others, many people cannot keep up with the pace of another person, you have to try to give space and work adapting to the other person. That will make you both perform much better as a team!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thanks to all the women who have opened this path for others, who don't stop growing and surpassing themselves, we are warriors!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3U6foQyJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/m3b0uxdo4md0l9e2bo70.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3U6foQyJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/m3b0uxdo4md0l9e2bo70.gif" alt="Female warriors"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
