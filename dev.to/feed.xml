&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#before-the-cryptocurrency-exchange-development"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Before the cryptocurrency exchange development:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before developing a crypto exchange platform it’s so crucial to know the budget you have for this project. Knowing your budget will help you and the Development Company to decide about the features, options, and customization of the website. The time it takes to develop the platform varies based on the customization of each website. &lt;br&gt;
Gain complete knowledge about all the factors that decide the development price and choose the type of exchange you want to launch. Based on the exchange type and the features, the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://radindev.com/cryptocurrency-exchange-development-cost/"&gt;cryptocurrency exchange development cost&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; will be different. The DEX development cost will be different than developing a centralized and so on. Different methods are being used to launch an exchange website which we are going to discuss in detail in the following each of them has some advantages and disadvantages and they have an effect on the development cost. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--N_dODIQ9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://radindev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Artboard-1-2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--N_dODIQ9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://radindev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Artboard-1-2.png" alt="features shape the cryptocurrency exchange cost"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-factors-decide-the-cryptocurrency-exchange-development-cost"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What factors decide the Cryptocurrency exchange development cost?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#type-of-the-exchange-development"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Type of the exchange development:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Centralized Crypto exchange:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The customers deposit their funds directly into the exchange, and the third party controls the whole transaction process. It works like a traditional and typical bank exchange where transactions take place after being approved. The exchanges depend on the person who is in control of the funds. The centralized exchange manages order books, which record all the buy and sell orders. The disadvantage of this type is that because they are stored in a specific place the possibility of hackers attack is so high. It is hard little to trust the security of these platforms.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;strong&gt;Decentralized crypto exchange:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Users can perform anonymous transactions without the need for a middle man, which means it does not depend on a third party to run and control the customer’s funds. The transactions in DEX happen directly peer-to-peer between the two individuals. This type of exchange will reduce the potential for rubbery because it doesn’t actually store the cryptocurrency. But you have to keep in mind that there is no third party in the exchange so solving all the errors and problems is on the traders.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Hybrid exchanges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Hybrid exchanges have the good features of both DEX and CEX exchanges. Hybrid crypto exchanges address the issue of centralized and decentralized exchanges. It has the usability and liquidity of centralized exchange and security of the decentralized exchange. &lt;br&gt;
Each of the categories of exchanges that are mentioned above affects the exchange development cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peer-to-peer exchange:&lt;/strong&gt;  p2p crypto exchanges software development refers to transferring cryptocurrencies that are not connected to the central bank and transactions can be executed without the need for a third party or a central organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#trading-orders"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Trading orders
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OTC order&lt;/strong&gt; over the counter order is simply the decentralized market in which individuals trade different assets directly between two parties without a central exchange or broker.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Stop limit&lt;/strong&gt; stop-limit order will be executed at a specified or better price, from the stop price that has been set before. As soon as it reaches the stop limit turns into the limit order to buy or sell at that limit price or higher.&lt;br&gt;
Margin order: margin order is a type of trading that the trader can borrow money from a broker to purchase stock and gain more benefit.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Future order&lt;/strong&gt; this refers to orders that traders bet on the future value of an asset with the terms that the trader will buy or sell the assets at the price they agreed on it in the future.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;OCO&lt;/strong&gt; OCO refers to one cancels the other order, the name of the trading shows how it works, in this type if the stop or limit price is reached and the transaction happens successfully, the other order will be canceled automatically.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--N7rV-raj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://radindev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Artboard-3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--N7rV-raj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://radindev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Artboard-3.png" alt="exchange development methods"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He also worked with companies such as Dell and Dish Network.&lt;br&gt;
The Coinbase exchange started with a small business that initially only worked with bitcoin, but eventually supported other coins as well, increasing the number of its employees.&lt;br&gt;
This exchange has been constantly growing and improving its features since the beginning of its 7-year life.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-does-coinbase-work"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How does Coinbase work?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users must first register on the cryptocurrency exchange platform. By entering user information such as name, email and then setting a password and verifying the email address you can then create a complete account and log informally.&lt;br&gt;
To start using Coinbase, there are two ways to buy cryptocurrency, these two methods are different, and you can choose one of them based on their features, which are described below.&lt;br&gt;
Using your bank accounts or credit card are two ways you should link to an exchange platform account. The two methods of buying cryptocurrency are different in terms of transaction speed and restrictions. &lt;br&gt;
Users who choose to link to their bank accounts are limited to transactions worth $ 2,500 per week. The downside is that it takes 2-4 business days for the purchased and sold coins to be displayed in the Coinbase account. While users who link their credit cards will immediately show the currencies they have purchased and exchanged in their Coinbase accounts. The downside is that this option has a higher trading limit of $ 250 per week.&lt;br&gt;
If the user chooses to buy a coin using a bank account, he/she will be asked to perform one or two trial transactions. If linking a credit card, users must send a screenshot of the card they want to link to Coinbase.&lt;br&gt;
Once the account is set up, users can exchange cryptocurrencies. Before each transaction, the cost of services and the number of coins purchased are displayed to the user. Once the user has sufficient funds, he can start his business. This platform provides details of the trade cost and purchase amount for verification. Once secured, encrypted currencies are stored in your wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;

  Comparison of Kucoin and Coinbase
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coinbase has more deposit methods, including the use of credit cards and bank accounts, receives lower costs for the purchase of cryptography, and in today's difficult conditions has made the most profit compared to its history and competitors.&lt;br&gt;
While KuCoin has trading costs of less than 0.1%, trading bots and many additional features are among the ways to make money on your cryptography.&lt;br&gt;
Coinbase has a trading volume of $ 213 billion. This exchange has more than 100 commercial pairs available. Supports Fiat currency trading.&lt;br&gt;
KuCoin has a trading volume of $ 36 billion. This exchange has 445 pairs of available trades. Does not support Fiat currency transactions.&lt;br&gt;
Result:&lt;br&gt;
Kucoin is good for low costs, order types, payment options, but Coinbase is better for beginners who want to pay less. It is also great for long-term traders who want high profits and lower losses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How not to update states in React!!</title>
      <author>Nehal Mahida</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 23 Oct 2021 03:50:19 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/nehal_mahida/how-not-to-update-states-in-react-33om</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/nehal_mahida/how-not-to-update-states-in-react-33om</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;How do you guys update your state if it depends on the previous value?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple!!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;counter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCounter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;updateCounter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCounter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;counter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you are doing the same as above, You are doing it wrong!! 😮&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my code works perfectly with the above syntax!! 😟&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, sometimes it works, sometimes it does NOT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WHY?? 🤔&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because react schedules state updates asynchronously, It does not perform them instantly. So if your code has multiple state updates you might be depending on some outdated or incorrect values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an official statement from React team about this issue&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;this.props&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;this.state&lt;/code&gt; may be updated asynchronously, you should not rely on their values for calculating the next state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmm, So what is the solution?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we go...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To handle this situation, react allows us to pass a function in setState, which will give us the previous value of a state. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here react guarantees us that the value is always updated correctly. 🤩&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;counter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCounter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;updateCounter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCounter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;prevState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// some logic &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;prevState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>The Developer Advocate's Guide to Addressing Product Friction</title>
      <author>Kurt Kemple</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 23 Oct 2021 03:06:09 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/theworstdev/the-developer-advocates-guide-to-addressing-product-friction-1p4j</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/theworstdev/the-developer-advocates-guide-to-addressing-product-friction-1p4j</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last three months, we've been developing a framework at Apollo called DX Audits to help us identify, document, report, and address product friction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team and company is growing quickly and it was becoming increasingly difficult to address product friction. We wanted a framework that would help us make that part of developer advocacy more repeatable, teachable, and reportable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, with a rough outline of a framework and our eyes bright and full of hope, we embarked on a journey of experimentation that led us to some fascinating places. We cried, laughed, and cried some more, and in the end, we discovered that the fundamentals behind these audits were sound and can provide a lot of value, but we were working with the wrong separation of concerns!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, I'll share what worked and what didn't work in the first version, how v2 differs from v1, and then we'll look at the updated DX audit process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're not familiar with the first version of the &lt;a href="https://www.apollographql.com/blog/community/devrel/dx-audits-a-framework-for-developer-advocacy/"&gt;DX Audit framework&lt;/a&gt; or if you just want to know what the framework looks like, you can skip to the "DX Audits v2" section. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-we-learned"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What we learned
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall the framework is solid. Adding structure around how we approach understanding developer pain points and delivering that feedback to other teams has largely impacted our dev advocacy work at Apollo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#benefits"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Benefits
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest win of the process by far was the friction logs. They have already had a significant impact on our ability to demonstrate the problems community members are facing. Other teams loved the detailed walkthroughs and additional context that we could provide with our insider knowledge. Because we were looking at developer workflows holistically, it exposed friction that otherwise was undocumented or unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from friction logs, we also benefitted from the audit process in two other significant ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Consistency and structure -&lt;/strong&gt; DX audits provide structure around what is otherwise an abstract part of developer advocacy. For example, our newest team member found it easier to understand how everyone approached delivering feedback because we all spoke the same language and followed the same process. On the other side, using the framework allowed us to extend that same consistency to other teams. For example, we now all deliver feedback in a unified format. A consistent method of feedback makes it easier for other teams to integrate it into their workflows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Proof of impact -&lt;/strong&gt; Ask any developer advocate what the most challenging part of the job is, and they'll likely say it's proving the impact they have. It's always been notoriously difficult to track the outcomes that stem from feedback. Now, we can keep track of our accomplishments in our DevRel database. Saving every friction log and action item that stems from an audit provides a direct paper trail from our work to the resulting changes made throughout the Apollo platform and the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#drawbacks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Drawbacks
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While overall, the process was a success, there were some issues with the first version of DX audits. Navigating any new approach will bring challenges, but the three things that caused significant friction (pun 100% intended) were: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Slow feedback loop -&lt;/strong&gt; I listed &lt;strong&gt;consistency and structure&lt;/strong&gt; as benefits from DX audits, but the framework created slow feedback loops in its original form. For example, with the cycle taking place over a few months, a friction log done in week two wouldn't technically get reported on or have any action items done to improve that friction for another five weeks or more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Workload bottlenecks -&lt;/strong&gt; With everyone on the team going through the cycle together, we ended up with surges in activity during certain stages and lulls in others. A more concrete example is that we released very little content during the build phase, but then during the implementation phase (now called the follow up phase), we had a surge of content in response to the findings in the audits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Too much ceremony -&lt;/strong&gt; We were doing way too much on the reporting front. I'm generally a big believer that you can't have too much documentation. Still, the original framework caused a lot of duplicated effort around documenting and reporting on our findings to others. So we spent a lot of time figuring out the best way to organize our feedback to be respectful of everyone's time and avoid duplication of communication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#our-epiphany"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Our epiphany
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before, the framework was sound, but we used the wrong separation of concerns! The most significant issues we faced were related to timing. Forcing each use case to wait for all the others to advance to the next step in the process created a bottleneck, preventing value from being created until the very end of the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, audits are scoped to an individual use case, and developer advocates move through each step independently of other use cases. This allows us to provide value in a much shorter timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7V-uTbwR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zktkbwl78e8yk17htcmr.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7V-uTbwR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zktkbwl78e8yk17htcmr.png" alt="Illustration showcasing each version of the audit process as a timeline. It shows the stark difference in time to receive feedback in each version of the framework. (1 week instead of 5)"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dx-audits-v2"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  DX Audits v2
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of a DX audit is to document, report, and address product friction by having a developer advocate experience a given developer workflow, document and report their findings, and surface actionable steps to take to reduce friction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An audit is scoped to a single use case that a developer advocate wants to experience. A use case is essentially a workflow that a developer would have to go through to complete a given task (i.e., add monitoring to a GraphQL server).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Audits consist of four steps. Discover, build, report, and follow up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#discover"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Discover
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This step is the work before the work. Discovery is where developer advocates should gather as much context about the use case they're about to audit. Depending on what initiates the audit, you might already have enough context to move ahead. However, there may be times you want to gather more information. In those cases, some great places to get feedback are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Community and customers&lt;/strong&gt; - GitHub, forums, social media, events, surveys and forms, issues raised by solutions, support and customer success, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Input from stakeholders&lt;/strong&gt; - product updates, roadmaps, engineering timelines, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes these audits so valuable to others is that aside from identifying friction, we also use our insider knowledge to surface actionable steps we can take to remedy it. Your feedback is only as good as the context you have!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't spend the time to make sure you have the full scope of the use case and have strong relationships with other teams, your feedback won't be as impactful as it could. Check out &lt;a href="https://dev.to/theworstdev/the-developer-advocates-guide-to-getting-buy-in-1ba4"&gt;The Developer Advocate's Guide to Getting Buy-in&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about providing quality feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#build"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Build
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this step, you'll work through the developer workflow from the previous step and record your experience in a friction log. Generally, developer advocates build a project that allows you to experience the workflow you want to audit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you build could be anything from an example app to working entirely within a given product UI. The important part is that you complete the workflow from start to finish with as much empathy and minimal assumptions as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friction logging is an excellent opportunity to create some content as well! For example, live streaming yourself going through these workflows and open-sourcing any projects you build can be a great resource of information for developers and an opportunity to get feedback from the community!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some helpful best practices we've landed on for making the most out of friction logs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Channel your empathy&lt;/strong&gt; – You want to approach the workflow as a developer might. Try to make no assumptions and question if the step would be more difficult for someone without your insider knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;More detail is better than less&lt;/strong&gt; – The goal is to provide enough context about the steps you took to achieve your goal that anyone can read the document and understand or retrace your steps to reach the same outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Don't forget the good&lt;/strong&gt; – When you experience something delightful, make sure to document that and also be sure to include the positive experiences when summarizing a friction log!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Consistency is key&lt;/strong&gt; – Everyone should be using the same template to create friction logs. Of course, DAs should have the freedom to use whatever tools allow them to be most productive, but friction logs need to be accessible and structured similarly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#report"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Report
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this step is to create a clear outline of what we see as wins and issues and provide that feedback to related decision-makers as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developer advocates should use their best judgment when deciding where and when to deliver feedback from an audit. In scenarios where someone may not expect input, it's best to make sure you include the right people and that you've done enough work upfront to &lt;a href="https://dev.to/theworstdev/the-developer-advocates-guide-to-getting-buy-in-1ba4"&gt;get the buy-in, you'll need&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a friction log is complete, the next step is to summarize and report your findings to involved parties. Add a detailed executive summary to the top of the friction log, including the highs and lows of the experience, any realizations or insights you uncovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be sure to document possible action items decision-makers could take to address any friction points discovered and add them to the friction log!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#follow-up"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Follow Up
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this step, DAs work on the action items outlined in the friction log and track progress from any items that require cross-team collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's essential to ask action item owners for a link to track the progress of the work. Having a direct link to the work done in response to your feedback allows you to 1) make sure you follow up and nothing falls through the cracks, and 2) directly connects the audit to every Jira issue, Airtable entry, or document that resulted from your feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use Airtable and some automation to make sure we see action items through to completion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GSrLL0y_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/w3g39bhodzv3mvzp2nsm.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GSrLL0y_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/w3g39bhodzv3mvzp2nsm.png" alt='A kanban view in Airtable that shows action items being moved through stages of completion. Each card in the "In Progess" and "Done" columns contains a link to the related work.'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DX Audits provide structure and make it easier to teach, repeat, and report on a part of developer advocacy work that is difficult to quantify. Not only are the audits beneficial to the DevRel team, but many other teams at Apollo have found them valuable, and they are becoming a standard part of our collaboration process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the initial version of DX audits was beneficial in many ways, we didn't realize those benefits until the very end of the cycle. Scoping audits down to a single-use case allows us to deliver value much faster while still maintaining enough structure to support our goals around collaboration and consistency.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fusetunnel - A Fast, Scalable, and Free Tunnel</title>
      <author>Chris More</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/chrismore/fusetunnel-a-fast-scalable-and-free-tunnel-47g0</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are many times where we want to share our localhost app with the world, either for testing purposes, to show progress, demo websites or run personal cloud services from your home. Fusetunnel helps you to do this easily! No need to mess with DNS or deploy to have others test out your changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fusetunnel is great for working with browser testing tools like Browserling or external API callback services like Twilio, which require a public URL for callbacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fusetunnel is Fusebit’s version of localtunnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main difference with localtunnel (and other tunnels) is that Fusetunnel is end-to-end encrypted, giving the user greater security, promoting data protection, and preventing unauthorized access to data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://fusebit.io/blog/fusetunnel-fast-scalable-and-free-tunnel/?utm_source=dev.to&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_content=cmore"&gt;Read more about Fusetunnel and fork the open-source repo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  Intro
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Howdy! 👋 I currently do not work in the tech industry. I went to school and received a CS degree, but have been working outside my degree since graduating. I am currently planning a career transition to jump into some sort of development and the timing worked out that as I was refreshing the skills I learned in school, I stumbled on theDEV community in late September just in time to see the Hacktoberfest 2021 announcement! What better way to get going on some open source contribution and learn some thing along the way. Here's a summary of my (sometimes simple) contributions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first contribution was focused on re-acquainting myself with git and GitHub CLI commands. So I found the &lt;a href="https://coders-railroad.netlify.app/"&gt;CodersRrailroad&lt;/a&gt; , which was a project started as a fun Hacktoberfest project for beginners. Right up my alley! After a quick JSON addition and fumbling through &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;gh&lt;/code&gt; commands, I submitted my first PR 👍.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;a href="https://github.com/Ohio-Elixir"&gt;

      &lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://github.com/Ohio-Elixir/ohio_elixir"&gt;
        ohio_elixir
      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;
      Main site repo
    &lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As I searched through of posts of potential projects and lists of issues, I came across a repo for &lt;a href="https://www.ohioelixir.com/"&gt;OhioElixir&lt;/a&gt;, which is a site for US-based community of Elixir developers and enthusiasts. The issue was seemingly simple: add a favicon to the site (which I've never done before). Simple enough, right? But wait... this site is built on a majority of Elixir code and runs a Phoenix framework. Thus begins the journey of briefly learning about both Elixir and Pheonix, how to install them (which seemed to be half of the battle), and how to run them. After much frustration and error, I was able to finally overcome and add a favicon properly to appear on all pages. Nailed it!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag-github-readme-tag"&gt;
  &lt;div class="readme-overview"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;
      &lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--i3JOwpme--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev.to/assets/github-logo-ba8488d21cd8ee1fee097b8410db9deaa41d0ca30b004c0c63de0a479114156f.svg" alt="GitHub logo"&gt;
      &lt;a href="https://github.com/alfg"&gt;
        alfg
      &lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://github.com/alfg/opendrinks"&gt;

      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;
      🍸 Open Source Drinks! Add your own recipe in a pull request! Inspired by 🎃Hacktoberfest!
    &lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Next up was a neat project I found, &lt;a href="https://opendrinks.io/"&gt;Open Drinks&lt;/a&gt;, where contributors can submit recipes for various alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. It was another great exercise of &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;gh&lt;/code&gt; commands as well as familiarizing myself with JSON objects and properties. I decided to submit a drink I enjoyed at the Christmas markets from my time in Germany, &lt;a href="https://opendrinks.io/recipe/gluhwein"&gt;Glühwein&lt;/a&gt;. Go checkout some other awesome &lt;a href="https://opendrinks.io/"&gt;recipes&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag-github-readme-tag"&gt;
  &lt;div class="readme-overview"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;
      &lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--i3JOwpme--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev.to/assets/github-logo-ba8488d21cd8ee1fee097b8410db9deaa41d0ca30b004c0c63de0a479114156f.svg" alt="GitHub logo"&gt;
      &lt;a href="https://github.com/rocambille"&gt;
        rocambille
      &lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://github.com/rocambille/library-of-twitter"&gt;
        library-of-twitter
      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;
      
    &lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Last, but definitely not least, was taking on a feature implementation for &lt;a href="https://rocambille.github.io/library-of-twitter/"&gt;Library of Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, which randomly generates a tweet of random characters. The added feature was to generate a tweet of random words and to also allow users to toggle between the two. Boy oh boy was this taking a huge bite. I have some very basic experience in web development just from online courses I've been taking, but the added complication of learning how to make &lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt; requests to a JSON file, implementing async functions, and working through Promises was not something I expected to be so complex. Also, coming up with a custom toggle radio button to match the app's design was also a big challenge. In the end though, I think the end result was a success! It may not be the cleanest code or most efficient way of implementing that functionality, but it works nonetheless and I was very pleased with the result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#wrapup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Wrap-up
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it was sometimes difficult to find the time to learn and code, Hacktoberfest has been very rewarding in giving me a nudge towards open source contribution and sparking that drive to carve out time to code. Thank you to all of the organizers of the event and those here on DEV that post incredibly helpful content for a beginner like me. Look forward to seeing y'all around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. Any advice from those that shifted careers to tech/development is well appreciated as I come up with my transition plan.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What Do You Mean By Design Pattern?</title>
      <author>Jr Gnu</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 23 Oct 2021 00:05:28 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/jrgnuproject/what-do-you-mean-by-design-pattern-53k0</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is a design pattern: Patterns are solutions to common software design problems? Knowing these patterns distinguishes a professional programmer from ordinary programmers. No matter what programming language you write in, knowing and using these templates in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern"&gt;software design&lt;/a&gt; can help you a lot in creating software. So, we advise you not to miss the continuation of this study in any way.&lt;br&gt;
What is a pattern design?&lt;br&gt;
Over time, programmers have encountered various problems in software development. Many of these problems were independent of programming languages and the like. So, to solve these problems, various solutions were the best way to resolve these problems, design patterns or Design Pattern say. In other words, sets of the best solutions to common problems in the software programming process are called design patterns. Pattern designs are developed by experienced programmers to solve common problems in object-oriented programming.&lt;br&gt;
[panel type = 'info' title = '']&lt;br&gt;
Design patterns are not part of software architectures and only provide the correct way of &lt;a href="https://www.signupgenius.com/go/10C0F49A4A822A5F8CF8-howtogrow"&gt;object-oriented coding&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, these templates only enter the realm of object-oriented coding and are independent of programming languages.&lt;br&gt;
[/ panel]&lt;br&gt;
History Of Design Patterns&lt;br&gt;
Design patterns were first introduced by Christopher Alexander. Christoph Alexander referred to design patterns as solutions to problems that commonly occur in the programming process. In 1994, a group called the Gang of Four, consisting of Eric Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and the Wilsides Cup, categorized design patterns by application. The Gang of Four, or GOF for short, published these patterns in a book called Design Patterns. This book divides 23 of the design patterns into three general categories and introduces and teaches them.&lt;br&gt;
In this book, Gamma and his colleagues have considered a specific structure to introduce each of the design patterns. They have refused to introduce design patterns visually. Because they believed that the introduction of design patterns required a new and specific structure. Therefore, they designed the following structure in order to better present the design of the patterns. The main components of this structure are:&lt;br&gt;
• Name and classification: state the name of the template and a short description of it.&lt;br&gt;
• Purpose: In this section, a brief description of the purpose of the template is provided.&lt;br&gt;
• Another name: If the design pattern is known by other names, they are introduced in this section.&lt;br&gt;
• Solution: This section deals with a scenario in which a design pattern is used and how to use classes and objects to solve the problem.&lt;br&gt;
• Application: This section describes the conditions under which the model will be used.&lt;br&gt;
• Structure: In this section, the main structure of design patterns using UML is displayed.&lt;br&gt;
• Classes and objects used: The responsibilities of the classes or objects used in the design template are written in this section.&lt;br&gt;
• How to Collaborate: This section describes how classes and objects work together.&lt;br&gt;
• Implementation method: In this section, the implementation steps are discussed.&lt;br&gt;
• Sample Code: In this section, examples are shown in the form of programming languages.&lt;br&gt;
• Practical examples: In this section, practical examples of the design pattern are mentioned.&lt;br&gt;
• Relationship between design pattern and other patterns: Related sections Design pattern with other patterns are examined in this section.&lt;br&gt;
Types Of Design Patterns In Software Engineering&lt;br&gt;
Design patterns are divided into three general categories, Creational Design Patterns, Structural Design Patterns, and Behavioral Design Patterns, according to the applications and purposes presented for that purpose.&lt;br&gt;
The Models Are Designed Producer (Creational Design Patterns)&lt;br&gt;
The design patterns to solve problems related to the creation of objects in an application are presented, the models are the manufacturer's design or Creational say. The most common design patterns are:&lt;br&gt;
• Singleton&lt;br&gt;
•  Factory Method&lt;br&gt;
• Prototype&lt;br&gt;
• Abstract Factory&lt;br&gt;
• Builder&lt;br&gt;
• Object Pool&lt;br&gt;
Structural Design Patterns&lt;br&gt;
Structural design patterns are a set of &lt;a href="http://ec2-3-90-209-53.compute-1.amazonaws.com/history-of-laravel/"&gt;solutions that help programmers solve&lt;/a&gt; software scalability problems. These design patterns are used to manage the relationship between classes and objects. These design patterns are:&lt;br&gt;
• Adapter &lt;br&gt;
• Decorator&lt;br&gt;
• Facade&lt;br&gt;
• Bridge&lt;br&gt;
• Composite&lt;br&gt;
• Flyweight&lt;br&gt;
• Proxy&lt;br&gt;
Behavioral Design Patterns&lt;br&gt;
Behavioral design patterns are a set of coding strategies related to the interaction and communication of objects. These design patterns are:&lt;br&gt;
• Chain of responsibility&lt;br&gt;
• Strategy&lt;br&gt;
• Iterator&lt;br&gt;
• Command&lt;br&gt;
• Mediator&lt;br&gt;
• Memento&lt;br&gt;
• Observer&lt;br&gt;
• State&lt;br&gt;
• Template Method&lt;br&gt;
• Real Targeted Visitor&lt;br&gt;
Advantages of using software design templates&lt;br&gt;
One can look at the design of patterns with the view that using them is, in fact, benefiting from the experience and expertise of the best object-oriented programmers in the coding process. Some believe that problems such as overuse of classes, poor design, and. Are among the fundamental problems of object-oriented programming. Pattern designs provide many benefits to programmers by properly understanding the principles of object-oriented programming. Among the most important benefits of using them can be mentioned the following:&lt;br&gt;
• Increase scalability&lt;br&gt;
• Expandability&lt;br&gt;
• Increase flexibility&lt;br&gt;
• Speed up software development&lt;br&gt;
• Reduce errors and problems&lt;br&gt;
• Reduce coding rate&lt;br&gt;
When And Where Should We Use Design Patterns?&lt;br&gt;
Knowing when and where to use design templates is one of the most common questions asked by programmers. Since each design pattern is provided for a specific application and to solve a specific problem in the programming process, we must be able to identify those problems during software development. After identifying and diagnosing such problems, we need to learn how to use the design patterns provided to solve them so that we can use them.&lt;br&gt;
Conclusion&lt;br&gt;
Understanding the concepts of design patterns is a must for all programmers. Because design templates are provided with the aim of solving common coding problems and standardizing the software development process. &lt;a href="https://bizhuubz-ideas-7a824.netlify.app/"&gt;Using design templates&lt;/a&gt;, programmers are able to build flexible, scalable, and scalable software that is designed to be principled.

      <title>Build an NFT Wallet with OutSystems &amp; Filecoin</title>
      <author>sydneylai</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 23:31:01 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/sydneylai/build-an-nft-wallet-with-outsystems-filecoin-2ik4</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/sydneylai/build-an-nft-wallet-with-outsystems-filecoin-2ik4</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Author: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sydneylai"&gt;@sydneylai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You hear about NFTs as collectables or images, but how do we store or collect them? Today we will build an NFT wallet and host them on IPFS as a unique NFT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We host the images in IPFS because this a peer to peer and a decentralized form of storage, rather than a centralized solution like AWS or Google Cloud. Therefore if AWS goes down or you forget to pay your Cloud subscription, you still have a hosting solution that assigned a unique identifier or content identifier (CID).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have a unique image, you can either distribute your NFTs on a marketplace, put it on a smart contract or turn it into a game. I'll include resources below for how else you can continue to build. This tutorial is for beginners who want to learn how to create and host their NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#start-here"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Start Here
&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Exposing a REST API for NFT Storage and OutSystems 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tools you'll need:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OutSystems IDE &lt;a href="https://outsyste.ms/developers"&gt;https://outsyste.ms/developers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Filecoin's NFT Storage &lt;a href="https://nft.storage/"&gt;https://nft.storage/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#filecoin-and-ipfs-explained"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Filecoin and IPFS Explained
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vocab 101&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CID&lt;/strong&gt; - content ID&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Pinning&lt;/strong&gt; - asking the node to keep the data, so that it's not trashed, if you pin it hte data presists&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Quede vs Pinning&lt;/strong&gt; - next deal brokered to get on the Filecoin network&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#making-an-nft-wallet-and-hosting-nfts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Making an NFT Wallet and Hosting NFTs
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nft.storage/"&gt;https://nft.storage/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here is your hosted image, with a CID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--paz6CeV---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/mSeqVgg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--paz6CeV---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/mSeqVgg.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hosting NFTs on marketplaces or wallets typically request ETH and gas. NFT developers who want free decentralized storage, you will be able to host your images on-chain with NFT.storage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just upload your data and you'll receive an IPFS hash of the content (a CID) that can be used in on-chain NFT data as a pointer to the content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MMIO-dU0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/scEMLLd.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MMIO-dU0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/scEMLLd.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How it works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upload your data, get back an IPFS hash of the content (a CID) that can be used in on-chain NFT data as a pointer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Storage + Retrieval is free!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Metadata is returned in proper formats!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fetch it back via IPFS (pinned redundantly &amp;gt;3x) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backed up to Filecoin (stored redundantly &amp;gt;5x)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://filecoin.io/"&gt;Filecoin&lt;/a&gt; provides long term storage for the data ensuring that even if nft.storage is attacked or taken down the NFT data persists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#consume-api"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Consume API
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AhxXoRZQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/pHRQ9Zh.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AhxXoRZQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/pHRQ9Zh.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can upload either a single file or consume the API to upload multiple files in a directory. The API follows a typical POST and GET Method.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;**/Upload** - Consuming the API / Post Method
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Explains uploads, throws it on some IPFS nodes, available over the network, not just centralized, it's free, the storage providers. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://nft.storage/api-docs/"&gt;https://nft.storage/api-docs/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#consume-nft-storage-api"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Consume NFT Storage API
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Start with a mobile app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you launch Service Studio, you want to create a mobile application by clicking on "From Scratch" and then "Phone app". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Name your application. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here you can design your application however you'd like. In this process, I'm creating an NFT wallet with a simple scrolling mechanism similar to the Instagram layout. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Consume the NFT Storage REST API&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on Service, as we are building a service to consume the REST API&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--s89wGaaQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/OPcthtT.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--s89wGaaQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/OPcthtT.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right Click on REST and consume REST API&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--D4VHjnnd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/qveCE74.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--D4VHjnnd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/qveCE74.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add Multiple Methods&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find the YAML file here &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://nft.storage/api-docs/"&gt;https://nft.storage/api-docs/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Convert the NFT Storage YAML file to a JSON&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://nft.storage/schema.yml"&gt;https://nft.storage/schema.yml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Convert with &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.convertjson.com/yaml-to-json.htm"&gt;https://www.convertjson.com/yaml-to-json.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6hK8yP6l--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/c32MHjg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6hK8yP6l--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/c32MHjg.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check and address any errors and warnings&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3: Create and map out your REST API&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add Authorizations to your Methods&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Double-click on the orange REST API Method titled "Click" &amp;gt; "Heads and Authentication"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Request headers dropdown select "Authorization"&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GUC6lf9K--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/ghidFSN.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GUC6lf9K--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/ghidFSN.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on the "Test" tab and include a CID in the URL parameter values. You can find your CID &lt;a href="https://nft.storage/api-docs/"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt; if you are logged in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bn5BsV4J--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/5a1BgES.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bn5BsV4J--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/5a1BgES.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
in Request headers values, Authorization, include: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bearer[KEY TOKEN]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bearer&lt;/strong&gt; - When things are stored in, there is a storage deal made, what each API call is doing in the background&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VwltSonJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/FMFQW6G.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VwltSonJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/FMFQW6G.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;click on "Test" to see an&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;"ok":true value&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy to response body&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on Finish &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hit the green Publish button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now repeat &lt;strong&gt;Step 3&lt;/strong&gt; for the rest of the REST API Methods titled "delete", "list", "status", "store" respectively&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the "List" method,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Include a future date for the &lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt; parameter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tNsGRyJb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/qZqWoov.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tNsGRyJb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/qZqWoov.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IaRcfaPF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/W8ZQ2BJ.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IaRcfaPF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/W8ZQ2BJ.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copy over and match the fields&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you're creating an Authorization input parameter for both "Status" and "Store" you may get an error or empty payload, just click "Finish"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7V8vggSL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/wKzGEVp.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7V8vggSL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/wKzGEVp.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hit the green Publish button&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4: Create a Service Action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Right Click on "Service Action" and title your action "List"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logic flow will visually appear&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Logic tab, &lt;br&gt;
Integrations &amp;gt; REST &amp;gt; NFTStorageAPI &amp;gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drag the "list" Run Server Action into the logic flow and click on the icon until you see the "Authorization" dropdown&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's empty&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In "list" Run Server Action, copy all four input parameters, and paste in the "List2" Service Action&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--smaw-3a8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/87BKrXc.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--smaw-3a8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/87BKrXc.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now include the Before and Limit within the List Run Server Action you just created on the Logic Flow&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--14n_G5IZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/jkrEGGY.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--14n_G5IZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/jkrEGGY.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assign the "list" Run Sever Action by dragging an "Assign" blue icon from the left tray into the logic flow, below the "list" icon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1U0MrYRB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/JuGUlq0.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1U0MrYRB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/JuGUlq0.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assign the variable with "Response"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AHy22WTC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/PMisnBD.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AHy22WTC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/PMisnBD.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💡 You may get errors asking to make your structures public&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 5: Integrate your API wrapper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To integrate your API, head to Interface &amp;gt; Home Screen and "Fetch Data from Other Sources", which I've named "ShowStorage"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ATtTv8r6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/42lS6td.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ATtTv8r6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/42lS6td.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the upper left-hand side there is a 🔌 icon where I will manage my dependencies. I want all the modules that I've created before, to be referenced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rVycuma9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/DxSowRF.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rVycuma9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/DxSowRF.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Head to the Logic tab and locate "List" Service Action, click on and drag the icon into the logic flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Head to the interface tab and double-click on the Output Parameter we've named "Response", set the Data Type to a ListResponse matching the Response Output Parameter in the Logic tab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the logic flow, drag and drop an Assign into the logic flow. In the drop-down, assign Response and List3.Response (or whichever number list you have show up).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pLdkqby1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/x95Op9t.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pLdkqby1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/x95Op9t.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your Run Server Action titled "List", set&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;before: "CurrDateTime()"&lt;br&gt;
Authorization: " "Bearer TOKEN" " &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your Authoization Bearer TOKEN is a string so must close in quotes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Hc8-3eK2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/4tg57AF.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Hc8-3eK2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/4tg57AF.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 6: Connect the database and images&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Interface tab in the Mainflow UI Flow, add a Block widget and add an Input Parameter titled "CID".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Double-Click on the "Home" Screen icon and select "Widget Tree" on the top right. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Content, drag and drop a Block widget and set the sources: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source Block "MainFlow\Block1"&lt;br&gt;
CID "ShowStorage.Response.value.Current.cid"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uOEEP7gH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/6ha9zX9.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uOEEP7gH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/6ha9zX9.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Include three "x.y Expression" widgets within Content&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first Expression, map the expression to &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ShowStorage.Response.value.Current.cid&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Folder structure is seen here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FciP5j4R--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/uFXRu2i.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FciP5j4R--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/uFXRu2i.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second Expression, can be expressed as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FormatDateTime(ShowStorage.Response.value.Current.created, "d MMM yyyy HH:mm")&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third Expression, we can showcase the pinning service. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Images&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Interface tab, click on the Block1 widget. Drag and drop an Image widget from the left. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set the Type to "External URL"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"https://" + CID + ".ipfs.dweb.link"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the API wrapper that I've titled "IPFSNFTStorage", create an Input Parameter within the "store" REST API Method. The Input Parameter will be named "Binary Image" and set the Data Type to "Binary Data".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hf6MI1pk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/a1XLz2r.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hf6MI1pk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/a1XLz2r.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now copy the three input parameters in store and create a Service Action titled "Upload" within the Service Actions folder. Paste the three input parameters within the "Upload" Service Action&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--W86J7ijt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/I2mGIr2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--W86J7ijt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/I2mGIr2.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Double-click on "Upload" Service Action and drag the store REST API Method onto the logic flow&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "Store" Run Server Action is like requestion something from someone, in this case asking someone for the image.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--by3_ed92--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/6GasJs7.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--by3_ed92--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/6GasJs7.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore the Assign widget in the logic flow will be the response to the request: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kOkLu3TJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/YAeddk1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kOkLu3TJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/YAeddk1.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#success-star"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Success ⭐
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have integrated your NFT Storage API and your mobile application can now display hosted NFTs&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Quickly Grab Stuff From Your Git History</title>
      <author>Ben Lovy</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 23:30:11 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/deciduously/quickly-grab-stuff-from-your-git-history-2bon</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/deciduously/quickly-grab-stuff-from-your-git-history-2bon</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While working through a problem, my colleague remembered a prior version of our application had a syntax example we could use.  Thankfully, the codebase has been checked into &lt;a href="https://git-scm.com/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;!  We knew the code in question revolved around the &lt;a href="https://blog.ielliott.io/nix-docs/stdenv-mkDerivation.html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkDerivation&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; functionality in &lt;a href="https://nixos.org/"&gt;nix&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, this particular code has been moved out of our codebase and added to &lt;a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs"&gt;&lt;code&gt;nixpkgs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so we can pull the derivation from the main tree instead of defining our own out-of-tree logic.  My first instinct was to start digging through that (huge) repository to find the file and use that as a reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No need!  We have it in our &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; history.  We can query this using &lt;code&gt;git log -S&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git log -S mkDerivation

    use mold and wasm-bindgen from nixpkgs

    use mold as the linker to speed up incremental compiles on x86_64-linux
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beautiful - that top commit looks like it represents when we switched to pull this derivation directly from &lt;code&gt;nixpkgs&lt;/code&gt;.  Removing the code is sufficient - each &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; commit represents a diff.  This commit should show us the code:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

            dontUseCmakeConfigure = "true";
            buildPhase = "make -j $NIX_BUILD_CORES";
            installPhase = "mkdir -p $out $out/bin $out/share/man/man1 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; PREFIX=$out make install";
          })
          cachix
          cargo-insta
          clang_12

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There it is, in the text!  In my terminal, additions are highlighted in green and removals are in red.  This was a removal, but you still get the full removed text.  I was able to copy that &lt;code&gt;stdenv.mkDerivation&lt;/code&gt; code and work from there.  Thanks, &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;.  (Thit).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an aside, I highly recommend the following &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; alias:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;l = "log --all --graph --decorate --abbrev-commit --format=format:'%C(bold blue)%h%C(reset) - %C(bold white)%an%C(reset) %C(bold yellow)%d%C(reset)%n%C(bold cyan)%aD%C(reset) - %C(bold green)(%ar)%C(reset)%n%C(white)%s%C(reset)'";
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It's a mess of text, but it produces super easy to read git histories:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;* 9b24232 - Ben Lovy  (HEAD -&amp;gt; main, origin/main, origin/HEAD)

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The coloration doesn't reflect here, in your terminal this will be &lt;em&gt;even cooler&lt;/em&gt;.  As a &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; novice, this sort of output is instrumental in keeping track of changes to the codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
