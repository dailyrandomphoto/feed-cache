&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#top-applications-of-deep-learning-in-healthcare"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Top applications of deep learning in healthcare
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#computer-vision-one-of-the-largest-successes-of-deep-learning-in-healthcare"&gt;

People can learn to predict the expert’s actions through imitation or by inferring the experts’ objectives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another healthcare domain that can benefit from deep reinforcement learning is robotic-assisted surgery (RAS). Deep learning can promote the robustness of RAS by using computer vision models to adapt to surgical environments and learn from physical motions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#generalized-deep-learning"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Generalized deep learning
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond computer vision, natural language processing, etc, generalized deep learning is adaptable to healthcare domains where data requires customized processes. More specifically, modern genomic technologies collect various measurements of proteins in their blood. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, deep learning in healthcare can use these data to analyze these measures, so it helps to provide more accurate treatments and diagnosis. Moreover, deep learning can further boost additional modalities such as medical images, and wearable device data. &lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/imshivanshpatel/good-bye-consolelogno-consolelog-in-2022-1foc</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;yes you heard it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we frequently use &lt;strong&gt;console.log()&lt;/strong&gt; to check our outputs in console, it's ok in Development mode but it is highly disgraced in production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so then what's the solution for it.so in production we basically use production grade loggers.This article is going to teach you how to use &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ps-logger"&gt;ps-logger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q.Why ps-logger ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
=&amp;gt;yes you have &lt;strong&gt;few&lt;/strong&gt; other options but the problem is that you have to do lots of manual configurations in it.That's why beginners don't even touch production grade loggers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ps-logger"&gt;ps-logger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a plug and play logger.There is no manual configurations.you have to just install and use it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm i ps-logger
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If &lt;code&gt;flex-direction: column&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;flex-direction: column-reverse&lt;/code&gt;, your &lt;code&gt;main-axis&lt;/code&gt; will run top to bottom or bottom to top of the page in the block direction (vertically).
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PyWG99nM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x9liam9aifn9hf5jt977.png" alt="Image description" width="709" height="227"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Flex item formula&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flex item(which means elements inside the flex container) following specific formula,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vQPLtTDH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vuvya31pioueoctmf15b.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vQPLtTDH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vuvya31pioueoctmf15b.png" alt="Image description" width="520" height="143"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Which conveys that,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If no &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;flex-basis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is specified, then the &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; falls back to the item's &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; property.&lt;br&gt;
If no &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; is specified, then the &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; falls back to the computed width of the item's contents&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;flex-basis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The default value of &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;b&gt;auto&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; take an element’s size across the main axis. which means,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if &lt;code&gt;flex-direction&lt;/code&gt; will be &lt;b&gt;row&lt;/b&gt; and flex-basis is 250px, then main axis is in inline direction(horizontally) and it take 250px in &lt;b&gt;width&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if &lt;code&gt;flex-direction&lt;/code&gt; will be &lt;b&gt;column&lt;/b&gt; and flex-basis is 250px, then main axis is in block direction(vertically) and it take 250px in &lt;b&gt;height&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you get my point😍. If can't, don't worry. You can understood through below example,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--acEfPqjj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i51kmnwotu59f2nefv81.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--acEfPqjj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i51kmnwotu59f2nefv81.gif" alt="Image description" width="800" height="295"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 if &lt;code&gt;flex-direction&lt;/code&gt; will be &lt;b&gt;row&lt;/b&gt; and flex-basis is 160px, then main axis is in inline direction(horizontally) and it take 160px in &lt;b&gt;width&lt;/b&gt;. If we change the flex direction to &lt;b&gt;column&lt;/b&gt;, then main axis is in block direction(vertically) and it take 160px in &lt;b&gt;height&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;code&gt;Flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; thus alternately determines width or height, depending on &lt;code&gt;flex-direction&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Seems like &lt;b&gt;dynamic&lt;/b&gt; in nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend you to practice in codpen like just swtich the &lt;code&gt;flex-direction&lt;/code&gt; and see the effect lively..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/preethi-dev/embed/bGoLOqe?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey, Still with me🥳. I can understood, You are getting very curious about &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; behaviour. So, It's my pleasure to show you &lt;b&gt;4 key behaviours of flex-basis&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4 key behaviours of flex-basis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; controls either “&lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt;” or “&lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt;” based on the &lt;code&gt;flex-direction&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; will override any other &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt; properties if specifically declared anything other than &lt;code&gt;flex-basis: auto;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; will still obey &lt;code&gt;min-width&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;max-width&lt;/code&gt; or height settings, which is based on &lt;code&gt;flex-direction&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; is set to &lt;b&gt;auto&lt;/b&gt;, it first checks for a &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt; property (based on direction) if none, it uses the elements content sizing.(just remember that flex-item formula &lt;b&gt;content &amp;lt;- width &amp;lt;- flex-basis&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; is: the size of flex items before they are placed into a flex container(which means before the flex-shrink or flex-grow getting applied). &lt;b&gt;It's the ideal or hypothetical size of the items&lt;/b&gt;. After placing the flex item in flex container, things may getting changed based on flex container size. Because flex container won't have enough space(&lt;code&gt;flex-shrink&lt;/code&gt; start to shrinking the items), or will have extra space(&lt;code&gt;flex-grow&lt;/code&gt; start to growing the items).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;uh😅, &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; guy have so much of behaviour and Congratulations,You reached the destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nVRbKW5M--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h9dbaimtu10jph7n1455.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nVRbKW5M--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h9dbaimtu10jph7n1455.gif" alt="Image description" width="498" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please execuse me, I will end up with a bonus info.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;A best practice is to just use flex-basis instead of width or height&lt;/b&gt;. Especially since Safari still has an old flexbox bug where it won't apply flex-shrink properly to items that use height instead of flex-basis&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If i continue now, which make you feel overwhelmed😥. &lt;b&gt;So, If you feel need live example for key behaviours of flex-basis and just drop a comment &lt;/b&gt;which make a way to know about your thought and I will start to build part-2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you loved this blog, Then give an endearing heart💝and drop your thought about this blog😍 which really a lot to me. I love the discussion with you, If you feel not comfortable at styling concepts or have any doubts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for Reading!!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Preethi&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;- Make your CSS life easier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey there! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm mixing up this week's win thread in honor of the upcoming new year (for those cultures that recognize the New Year as beginning this upcoming Saturday, that is). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of looking back on our weeks, what would you say your biggest win was for this past YEAR? What are you proud of having accomplished?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All wins count — big or "small" 🎉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of 2021 'wins' include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting a new job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning to value your personal strengths &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking more time off to unplug with loved ones regularly ... or whatever else might have sparked joy and purpose ❤️ &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Congrats on your accomplishments in 2021! You're amazing 🌠 &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introduction to Asynchronous Processing and Message Queues</title>
      <author>Apoorv Tyagi</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2021 06:08:46 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/apoorvtyagi/introduction-to-asynchronous-processing-and-message-queues-27od</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/apoorvtyagi/introduction-to-asynchronous-processing-and-message-queues-27od</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a client-server architecture, the client can request a job to be done from the server by sending messages between each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Handling this communication can increase in complexity when you begin to manage the rate at which messages are sent, the number of requests a server can handle, or the response time which the client demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog, we'll see one way to handle this intricacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-synchronous-processing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Synchronous Processing?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In synchronous processing, a client sends a request to the server and waits for the server to complete its job and send back the response before the client can resume doing any other work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process is often referred to as a &lt;em&gt;blocking&lt;/em&gt; request as the client gets blocked from doing any other work until a response is received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GNhszEDd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640532456293/NNIoKI1h2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GNhszEDd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640532456293/NNIoKI1h2.png" alt="image.png" width="875" height="587"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-asynchronous-processing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Asynchronous Processing?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asynchronous processing is the exact opposite of synchronous processing. Here, the client doesn't wait for a response after sending a request to the server and continues doing any other work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process is referred to as a &lt;em&gt;non-blocking&lt;/em&gt; request as the execution thread of the client is not blocked. This allows systems to scale as more work can be done in a given amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#synchronous-vs-asynchronous-processing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Synchronous vs Asynchronous Processing
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synchronous requests block the execution thread of the client, forcing them to wait for the response to come before they can perform another action. On the other hand, asynchronous requests do not block and allow for more work to be done in a given time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since we do not know much time the request will take, it is difficult to build responsive applications with synchronous processing. The more blocking operations, the slower system becomes. With asynchronous processing, response time is quick as the client does not have to wait on the request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fault tolerance of asynchronous processing is higher than that of synchronous processing, as it is easy to build a retry mechanism when a request fails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wN6DiVmG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640532560708/lA0pdjuge.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wN6DiVmG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640532560708/lA0pdjuge.png" alt="image.png" width="450" height="253"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-are-message-queues"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What are Message Queues?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A message queue is a component that buffers requests from one service and broadcasts asynchronously to another service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, clients are the message producers, who send request messages to the queue instead of any server. They get an acknowledgment when the message is added to the queue, which enables them to continue with their other jobs without having to wait for the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Servers are known as message consumers and are served these messages from the queue based on the number of requests they can serve at any given time. This continues until all the messages in the queue have been served.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two most common messaging queues are — &lt;a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/"&gt;RabbitMQ&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://kafka.apache.org/"&gt;Kafka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#structure-of-message-queues"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Structure of Message Queues
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A message queue is primarily a broker of messages between message producers and message consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each distinct entity in the messaging queue setup (producers, consumers, and queue) has a responsibility and they're decoupled from each other as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only contract between all entities is the messages for which the message queue facilitates the movement from producers to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following sections, we will discuss the responsibilities of each component and look at the various modes with which the message queue delivers a message to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#message-producers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Message Producers
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Message producers initiate the asynchronous processing request. Producers have a responsibility to generate a valid message and publish it to the message queue. Messages submitted to the queue are then queued up and delivered to consumers to be processed asynchronously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Producers communicate with message queues using the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#message-brokers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Message Brokers
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A message broker is simply just a queue. You can even implement a simple broker programmatically that buffers messages and sends them to consumers as and when needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Message brokers are the actual decoupling elements in the setup, sitting between and managing the process of communication between producers and consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of their simplicity, brokers are optimized for high concurrency and throughput.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that adding message brokers introduces an extra layer of complexity into your infrastructure and requires you to scale them as well. Brokers also have specific requirements and limitations when it comes to scalability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#message-consumers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Message Consumers
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main responsibility of consumers is to receive and process messages from the queue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most consumers are API services that perform that actual asynchronous processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumers can be implemented in different application languages or technologies and maintained independently from other components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve decoupling, consumers should know nothing about the producers. The only contract that should exist between the two is valid messages from the queue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When properly decoupled, consumers can serve as independent service layers that can be used by both the message queue setup and other components in your infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#consumer-communication-strategies"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Consumer Communication Strategies
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Message queues need to transmit messages down to consumers, depending on how application developers implement consumers, message queues have three distinct ways of delivering messages to the consumers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Pull Model&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this model, the consumer periodically checks the status of the queue. This is done at a scheduled interval programmed on the side of the consumer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are messages found in the queue, the consumer picks them up until there are no more messages left to process, or when the 'N' number of messages has been consumed. This 'N' can be configured on the message broker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Push Model&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a message is added, the consumer is notified and the message is then pushed down to it. Messages are pushed down to consumers at a rate at which the consumer can easily regulate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Subscription Model&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this model, consumers can subscribe to a topic. This publisher publishes a message to a topic rather than a queue. Each consumer connected to the broker maintains its private queue to receive messages from topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the consumers subscribe to the topics and when a message is published to that topic, the message is cloned for each subscriber and added to the consumer’s private queue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#comparing-different-message-brokers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Comparing Different Message Brokers
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we have seen above, for asynchronous communication we usually need a message broker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are the few considerations you have to look at when choosing a broker for managing your asynchronous operations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Scale&lt;/strong&gt;: The number of messages sent per second in the system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Data Persistency&lt;/strong&gt;: The capability to recover messages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Consumer Capability&lt;/strong&gt;:  The capability to manage one-to-one / one-to-many consumers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#rabbitmq"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  RabbitMQ
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Scale: Based on configuration and resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Persistency: Both persistent and transient messages are supported.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  One-to-one vs One-to-many consumers: Both.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RabbitMQ supports all major languages, including Python, Java, .NET, PHP, Ruby, JavaScript, Go, Swift, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#kafka"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Kafka
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Scale: Can send up to a million messages per second.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Persistency: Yes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  One-to-one vs One-to-many consumers: Only one-to-many&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kafka has managed SaaS on both Azure and AWS. Kafka also supports all major languages, including Python, Java, C/C++, Clojure, .NET, PHP, Ruby, JavaScript, Go, Swift, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#redis"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Redis
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Scale: Can send up to a million messages per second.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Persistency: Not supported (it’s an in-memory database).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  One-to-one vs One-to-many consumers: Both.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Redis is a bit different from the other message brokers. Redis is an in-memory data store. Originally, Redis only supported one-to-one communication with consumers. However, since Redis 5.0 introduced the pub-sub, you can have one-to-many as another option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog, we covered how asynchronous processing is advantageous over its counterparts and how a message queue helps us achieve asynchronous processing along with keeping the different entities in its setup decoupled from each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also covered some basic characteristics of the most commonly used message brokers: Redis, Kafka, and RabbitMQ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a bit more detailed instruction for selecting the right message broker to use according to different use cases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short-lived Messages: Redis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Redis is good for short-lived messages where persistence isn’t required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Large Amounts of Data: Kafka&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Kafka is good for storing a large amount of data for long periods. Kafka is also ideal for one-to-many use cases where persistency is required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complex Routing: RabbitMQ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  RabbitMQ is good for complex routing communication.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>HELM Cheatsheet: For Beginners</title>
      <author>aashiya123</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2021 06:01:25 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/aashiya123/helm-cheatsheet-for-beginners-1cb3</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Helm is a package and operation manager for Kubernetes. Though handling Kubernetes applications and several releases can increase the development and deployment complexities. The Helm as a packaging manager allows you to wrap up all the Kubernetes components within a single package for deployment, thus reducing complexities. You can integrate several Kubernetes objects within the Helm chart, which is deployed as a whole. You can use Helm to deploy a single application or a part of an extensive application. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of tools that can be used with Helm charts to ease the Kubernetes deployment process. You can also integrate the Helm charts within the CI/CD process to automate each process, giving developers leverage to work on writing codes rather than running and handling production deployments. You can use and install the Helm with one click. Helm comes with the command-line user interface called ‘helm’ to perform the Helm functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Below are some Helm commands&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helm help command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above command will provide you information about the available Helm commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;# helm help&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want any details about the Helm command, you can use the helm help  below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;# helm help search&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helm search command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above command will allow you to search for the charts. You can use helm search  as mentioned below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;# helm search phpmyadmin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;output-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
NAME                    CHART VERSION   APP VERSION     DESCRIPTION&lt;br&gt;
stable/phpmyadmin       4.3.5           5.0.1           DEPRECATED phpMyAdmin is an mysql administration frontend&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helm fetch command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the above command, you can download the chart locally without installing it. You can use the chart name with the fetch command to download all the charts and template files within the directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;# helm fetch stable/phpmyadmin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;# ls -ltr&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;output- &lt;br&gt;
Total 32&lt;br&gt;
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 28921 Jun 29 11:04 phpmyadmin-4.3.5.tgz&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helm install command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the above command, you can easily install the chart followed by the chart name. You can use the ‘- name’ option if you want to name the deploy chart and ‘- version’ to specify the chart version as per your requirement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;# helm install stable/phpmyadmin --name myphpadmin --version 4.3.3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above command will provide the deployed resources overview, which can be checked from the Kubernetes with the below command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;# kubectl get all |grep -i myphpadmin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helm init command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use the above command to initialize the helm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helm status command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check the chart installation status using the above command. You have to provide the chart name about which you want the status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;# helm status myphpadmin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helm list command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use the list command with complete details of the currently deployed chart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;# helm list&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;output- &lt;br&gt;
NAME            REVISION        UPDATED                         STATUS          CHART                   APP VERSION     NAMESPACE&lt;br&gt;
myphpadmin      1               Mon Jun 29 11:35:32 2020        DEPLOYED        phpmyadmin-4.3.3        5.0.1           default&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helm upgrade command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the help of the upgrade command, you can upgrade the chart version. In the above examples, we have version 4.3.3, and now we are upgrading it to 4.3.4 using the below command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;# helm upgrade myphpadmin stable/phpmyadmin --version 4.3.4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helm history command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the above command’s help, you can check the installed chart’s history followed by the chart name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;# helm history myphpadmin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;output- &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REVISION        UPDATED                         STATUS          CHART                   APP VERSION     DESCRIPTION&lt;br&gt;
1               Mon Jun 29 11:35:32 2020        SUPERSEDED      phpmyadmin-4.3.3        5.0.1           Install complete&lt;br&gt;
2               Mon Jun 29 11:53:48 2020        DEPLOYED        phpmyadmin-4.3.4        5.0.1           Upgrade complete&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helm rollback command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use the rollback command if you want to move to the previous version of the helm chart. You have to mention the version number with the command as mentioned below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;# helm rollback myphpadmin 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Rollback was a success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helm delete command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can delete the helm chart using the delete command as mentioned below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;# helm delete myphpadmin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
release "myphpadmin" deleted&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helm repo list command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the help of the above command, you can list down the repositories used currently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;# helm repo list&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;output- &lt;br&gt;
NAME    URL&lt;br&gt;
stable  &lt;a href="https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com"&gt;https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
local   &lt;a href="http://127.0.0.1:8879/charts"&gt;http://127.0.0.1:8879/charts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helm repo update command
With the help of the above command, you can update the repositories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;# helm repo update&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;output- &lt;br&gt;
Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...&lt;br&gt;
...Skip local chart repository&lt;br&gt;
...Successfully got an update from the "stable" chart repository&lt;br&gt;
Update Complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helm reset command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use the reset command to uninstall the tiller component and the ‘-remove-helm-home’ option after the remove command to remove the helm’s home directory. You can use the ‘-f’ option to remove it forcefully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;# helm reset -f --remove-helm-home&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;output- &lt;br&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you have ever been on a job hunt for a software developer position, you would have come across the so-called LeetCode style interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that most of us don’t have to &lt;a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/"&gt;invert a Binary Tree&lt;/a&gt; at our actual job, that is how most coding/technical interviews are conducted at big tech companies like Google and Microsoft. Yes, even at the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies"&gt;unicorns&lt;/a&gt; (except for Stripe, because they are cool) and startups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I’ll be writing about the thought process of how I came about building and deploying a very simple JavaScript app for free with &lt;a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/"&gt;Cloudflare Worker&lt;/a&gt;. If you simply want to deploy and use the app on your own, check out the repository &lt;a href="https://github.com/ngshiheng/todoleet"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tldr"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  TL;DR
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;  How to get the Daily LeetCoding Challenge question using LeetCode API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Creating a Todoist task using Todoist API&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#problem-statement"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Problem Statement
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since a year ago, I have been trying to make it a habit to solve the Daily LeetCoding Challenge (which I’m still struggling with). As I am using &lt;a href="https://todoist.com/"&gt;Todoist&lt;/a&gt; as my main productivity tool of choice, I have a daily task that looks just like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZjNmaAcB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ybr1vh7bwp9ihw2ivbdr.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZjNmaAcB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ybr1vh7bwp9ihw2ivbdr.png" alt="My Todoist habitual tasks" width="700" height="218"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Todoist habitual tasks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a lazy person, having to check leetcode.com every time I want to practice is too much of a hassle. So then I thought, why not just sync the Daily LeetCoding Challenge to my Todoist every day?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#requirements"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Requirements
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by defining what I want the app to do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get Daily LeetCoding Challenge question&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to create a new task on my Todoist account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sync new Daily LeetCoding Challenge question on time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The app has to sync on time for free every day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start!&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#leetcode-api"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  LeetCode API
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any sane person would do, the first thing I did was to do some research. By research, I meant I started to Google for information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did was to immediately Google for “leetcode API”, looking for the official API documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#official-api-documentation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Official API documentation
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, there wasn’t any official LeetCode API documentation available. While there is a couple of unofficial LeetCode API repositories on GitHub, I would rather not use any unofficial API due to reliability concerns (poorly maintained, outdated, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-good-ol-devtool-inspection"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Good Ol’ DevTool inspection
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second thing that immediately came to my mind was to inspect the network request being made while visiting the site &lt;a href="https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/"&gt;https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this, I was able to figure out the exact API called to query for the Daily LeetCoding Challenge — done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Vw5UmkHo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kebw2s3s6y0kjugedpj6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Vw5UmkHo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kebw2s3s6y0kjugedpj6.png" alt="Since LeetCode is using GraphQL, you would need to check out the “Payload” tab to see the GraphQL body" width="700" height="382"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since LeetCode is using GraphQL, you would need to check out the “Payload” tab to see the GraphQL body&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the GraphQL request body:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight graphql"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# HTTP POST to https://leetcode.com/graphql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;questionOfToday&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;activeDailyCodingChallengeQuestion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;userStatus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;question&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;acRate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;difficulty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;freqBar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;frontendQuestionId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;questionFrontendId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;isFavor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;paidOnly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;isPaidOnly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;titleSlug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hasVideoSolution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hasSolution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;topicTags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;slug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can use the &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; command below to try it out yourself:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--request&lt;/span&gt; POST &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--url&lt;/span&gt; https://leetcode.com/graphql &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Content-Type: application/json'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'{"query":"query questionOfToday {\n\tactiveDailyCodingChallengeQuestion {\n\t\tdate\n\t\tuserStatus\n\t\tlink\n\t\tquestion {\n\t\t\tacRate\n\t\t\tdifficulty\n\t\t\tfreqBar\n\t\t\tfrontendQuestionId: questionFrontendId\n\t\t\tisFavor\n\t\t\tpaidOnly: isPaidOnly\n\t\t\tstatus\n\t\t\ttitle\n\t\t\ttitleSlug\n\t\t\thasVideoSolution\n\t\t\thasSolution\n\t\t\ttopicTags {\n\t\t\t\tname\n\t\t\t\tid\n\t\t\t\tslug\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n","operationName":"questionOfToday"}'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Code&lt;br&gt;
Enough talking, let’s start to write some code that does exactly what we went through:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Just some constants&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;LEETCODE_API_ENDPOINT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;https://leetcode.com/graphql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;DAILY_CODING_CHALLENGE_QUERY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`
query questionOfToday {
    activeDailyCodingChallengeQuestion {
        date
        userStatus
        link
        question {
            acRate
            difficulty
            freqBar
            frontendQuestionId: questionFrontendId
            isFavor
            paidOnly: isPaidOnly
            status
            title
            titleSlug
            hasVideoSolution
            hasSolution
            topicTags {
                name
                id
                slug
            }
        }
    }
}`&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// We can pass the JSON response as an object to our createTodoistTask later.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetchDailyCodingChallenge&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Fetching daily coding challenge from LeetCode API.`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;init&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;method&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Content-Type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;application/json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;DAILY_CODING_CHALLENGE_QUERY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;LEETCODE_API_ENDPOINT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Task “Get Daily LeetCoding Challenge question” — checked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#todoist-api"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Todoist API
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like what we did in the previous step, I was able to find the &lt;a href="https://developer.todoist.com/rest/v1/#overview"&gt;official API documentation&lt;/a&gt; for Todoist. Typically, the first section that I always look for in API documentation is the &lt;a href="https://developer.todoist.com/rest/v1/#authorization"&gt;Authorization&lt;/a&gt; section, especially when you want to perform create/update/delete operations on an app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, authorization was pretty straightforward for Todoist:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://todoist.com/app/settings/integrations"&gt;Get your API token&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whenever you make a request, attach &lt;code&gt;Authorization: Bearer xxx-your-todoist-api-token-xxx&lt;/code&gt; to your HTTP request header&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of what the curl command to create a new task on Todoist would look like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--request&lt;/span&gt; POST &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'https://api.todoist.com/rest/v1/tasks?='&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Authorization: Bearer xxx-your-todoist-api-token-xxx'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Content-Type: application/json'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'{
"content": "Buy a jar of peanut butter",
"due_string": "Today"
}'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Code
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing a function that does what we said is relatively easy, it looks something like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;TODOIST_API_ENDPOINT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;https://api.todoist.com/rest/v1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Passing in the `question` object from fetchDailyCodingChallenge function&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createTodoistTask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;question&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;questionInfo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;question&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;activeDailyCodingChallengeQuestion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;questionTitle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;questionInfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;question&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;questionDifficulty&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;questionInfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;question&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;difficulty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;questionLink&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`https://leetcode.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;questionInfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Creating Todoist task with title &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;questionTitle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;questionTitle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;](&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;questionLink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;)`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Difficulty: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;questionDifficulty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;due_string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Today&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;priority&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;init&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;method&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Content-Type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;application/json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;Authorization&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Bearer &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;TODOIST_API_TOKEN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Set at environment variable&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;TODOIST_API_ENDPOINT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/tasks`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Task “Create a new task on my Todoist account” — done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cloudflare-worker"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cloudflare Worker
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we’re down to our one final task — running/automating the 2 tasks above every day, for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that came to my mind was Cron job. So, I immediately started looking for free solutions on the Internet. After spending a couple of hours doing some homework, I came across Cloudflare Worker, and I figured to give them a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It runs on V8 JavaScript, not Node.js&lt;br&gt;
This is probably one of the most common misconceptions &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudflare-workers/"&gt;about Cloudflare Worker&lt;/a&gt;. As the worker’s environment is not in Node.js, a lot of packages (e.g. &lt;code&gt;npm install some-node-package&lt;/code&gt;) that are running on Node.js would simply not work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tip: Check out the supported packages and libraries &lt;a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/works"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lucky for us, we only need to use the JavaScript built-in &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch"&gt;&lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#more-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  More code
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting a Cloudflare Worker project is dead simple (&lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/quickstarts"&gt;reference&lt;/a&gt;), basically:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install the Wrangler CLI using &lt;code&gt;npm install -g @cloudflare/wrangler&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run wrangler generate  &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/quickstarts#templates"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The entry point is &lt;code&gt;addEventListener&lt;/code&gt; function. For our use case, we will be using the &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/scheduled-event"&gt;ScheduledEvent&lt;/a&gt; API where we simply have to change our event from &lt;code&gt;"fetch"&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;"scheduled"&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s stitch everything together:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Move the constants to const.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;syncLeetCodeCodingChallenge&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;question&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetchDailyCodingChallenge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createTodoistTask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;question&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;scheduled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Change 'fetch' to 'scheduled'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;waitUntil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;syncLeetCodeCodingChallenge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, we would simply need to modify the wrangler.toml as below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight toml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="py"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"&amp;lt;your-project-name&amp;gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="py"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"webpack"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="err"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nn"&gt;[triggers]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="py"&gt;crons&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"1 0 * * *"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the setting above, the worker will run every day at &lt;a href="https://crontab.guru/#1_0_*_*_*"&gt;00:01 UTC&lt;/a&gt; and sync the Daily LeetCoding Challenge to your Todoist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all! Moving on to testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-test-cloudflare-workers-locally"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to test Cloudflare workers locally
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to try out the Cron triggers locally, we would need to install the &lt;a href="https://miniflare.dev/cli.html"&gt;Miniflare CLI&lt;/a&gt;. After installation, you may run your worker using:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# At terminal 1&lt;/span&gt;
miniflare

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# At terminal 2&lt;/span&gt;
curl &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"http://localhost:8787/.mf/scheduled"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you see a new task is created on your Todoist, you have made it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#deployment"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Deployment
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No side project is ever done without hosting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To deploy the app on your own immediately, check out the &lt;a href="https://github.com/ngshiheng/todoleet"&gt;project repository&lt;/a&gt; and use the &lt;a href="https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/ngshiheng/todoleet"&gt;“Deploy with Workers”&lt;/a&gt; button. If you’re interested in the know-how:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a Cloudflare account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add &lt;code&gt;TODOIST_API_TOKEN&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;code&gt;wrangler secret put TODOIST_API_TOKEN&lt;/code&gt;. You may find the newly added secret under 'Cloudflare Worker' → 'Settings' → 'Variables'. You can get your Todoist API token &lt;a href="https://todoist.com/app/settings/integrations"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optional: This is only required for &lt;a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-cloudflare-workers-with-wrangler"&gt;Wrangler actions&lt;/a&gt;. Add &lt;code&gt;CF_API_TOKEN&lt;/code&gt; into your GitHub repository secrets. You can create your API token from &lt;a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens"&gt;https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens&lt;/a&gt; using the &lt;code&gt;Edit Cloudflare Workers&lt;/code&gt; template.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, to publish any new changes to your Cloudflare Worker, run &lt;code&gt;wrangler publish&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we are finally done!&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#closing-thoughts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Closing Thoughts
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there’s a lot more that we could have done, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Handling unanswered questions from previous days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Making the app configurable/customizable for users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Add tags to our task&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Allowing users to create a random LeetCode question as a task based on question tag&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to leave these features out for another day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is a lot of hate on coding interviews as such, I personally look at it this way — by learning some brain teasers, you probably get paid a lot more, so why not? It is really a matter of perspective. If you happen to enjoy doing them, that is even better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I don’t find as much joy doing LeetCode questions. Rather, I work on LeetCode problems as if I am lifting weights at the gym. While I don’t enjoy lifting weights, I do like reaping the benefits of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all for today. Let me know what are you building with Cloudflare Worker!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello Devs, if you are aiming for cloud certifications in 2022 but are not sure which cloud certification should you go for then you have come to the right place. Earlier, I have shared a list of the &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/12/top-10-it-certifications-for-java-programmers.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;best IT certifications for Java developers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and today, I am going to talk about the best cloud certification to aim for in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can go through this list of cloud certifications and choose the best one depending upon your skills and experience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have shared the best cloud certifications for beginners, developers, system admins, and solution architects from Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing services is growing exponentially in nowadays technology and become a priority among big-name organization such as Netflix which uses Amazon AWS to run their business from hosting to database and analytics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, many cloud computing has come to the real world with different infrastructure and services such as &lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/5-best-courses-to-learn-google-cloud-platform-gcp-in-2021-169093a3771a"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Cloud&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/5-best-azure-fundamentals-courses-to-pass-az-900-certification-exam-in-2020-9e602aea035d"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Azure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of those cloud services are complicated in their infrastructure and it requires the person who wants to deal with them to get some sort of certificate to deal with a specific service and companies nowadays are requiring people to have these certifications in order to validate their skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article will discuss with you some of the best cloud certifications from companies like Amazon &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AWS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google cloud&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and having those certifications will make your resume stand out among the other competitor during the hiring process and you can get a higher salary than the others without those certifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, if you want to become a Full Stack Cloud Developer in 2022 then Coursera has an excellent resource called &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=CuIbQrBnhiw&amp;amp;mid=40328&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fprofessional-certificates%2Fibm-full-stack-cloud-developer"&gt;IBM Full Stack Cloud Developer Professional Certificate&lt;/a&gt; which you can use to learn Cloud Native and Full Stack Development using hands-on projects with Containers, Microservices and more and start your career in application development in cloud native environment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=CuIbQrBnhiw&amp;amp;mid=40328&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fprofessional-certificates%2Fibm-full-stack-cloud-developer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zjy25g4t--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera_assets/meta_images/generated/XDP/XDP%257ESPECIALIZATION%21%257Eibm-full-stack-cloud-developer/XDP%257ESPECIALIZATION%21%257Eibm-full-stack-cloud-developer.jpeg" alt="IBM Full Stack Cloud Developer Professional Certificate | Coursera" width="880" height="461"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-microsoft-certified-azure-fundamentals"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you notice, all top four cloud certification is from Amazon AWS, and it's because AWS is the most popular public cloud platform for both startups and big companies but Microsoft Azure is catching up quickly which has, in turn, boost the demand for certified Azure Cloud professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Azure fundamentals certification is better for individuals to know some foundation of the cloud services and this certificate will teach you the cloud concepts as well as how to use Microsoft Azure services, security, privacy, and pricing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the best cloud certification for beginners who wants to learn Azure. This is very similar to AWS cloud practitioner and you can pass this certification with a couple of weeks' preparation. If you need recommendations then this course on Udemy &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Faz-900-azure-exam-prep-understanding-cloud-concepts%2F"&gt;AZ-900 Azure Exam Prep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; will explain all of this in one course and prepare you for the exam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the same note, if you want to start with Google Cloud then you can prepare for &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2021/11/top-5-courses-to-crack-google-cloud.html"&gt;Google Cloud Platform Digital Cloud Leader&lt;/a&gt; and if you are working or going to work on AWS Platform then you can aim for the Cloud Practitioner exam in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these three exams are respective introductory and easiest cloud certification for their respective platform but if you have to choose the easiest between three of them then I highly recommend you to go for &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/02/top-5-courses-to-crack-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-exam-certification-clf-c01.html#axzz7BbH9AnEo"&gt;AWS Cloud Practitioner&lt;/a&gt; as its most popular and probably easier to clear than the other two as AWS is the most mature public cloud platform out there.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Connecting to a database and managing it absolutely not beginner friendly! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing your backend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deploying it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and Deploying on the other side requires further knowledge about cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a backend developer myself who usually writes the backend in python coupled with a micro framework called &lt;a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/"&gt;flask&lt;/a&gt; it's quite hard and time consuming to deploy a single letter change I made in script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now its not gonna be the same, integrating a backend is simplified to integrating an API!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSV2API is tiny project that helps noobs to integrate a Database with the beginner knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here's how we do it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A database as the name suggests we need data, it is usually store in cloud storages. Here it is going to a CSV file that is manually stored in our repository or any other online storage provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The minimum pre-requisite in a Database is &lt;strong&gt;querying&lt;/strong&gt; and CSV2API supports that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial we will be using this &lt;a href="https://github.com/dev-Roshan-lab/healthcare/blob/main/data.csv"&gt;sample&lt;/a&gt; dataset, which talks about a list of Doctors and their job in their niche.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a simple API request to our simplest backend which is already created for us, in python programming language would be:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://csv2api1.p.rapidapi.com/api/v1"&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="n"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;'x-rapidapi-host'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"csv2api1.p.rapidapi.com"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;'x-rapidapi-key'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"YOUR-RAPIDAPI-KEY"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;querystring&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"url"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev-Roshan-lab/healthcare/main/data.csv"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"GET"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;querystring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Output:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such a simple API request can helps us with a JSON string which can further consumed as per the needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let us understand the code:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At first we import &lt;a href="'https://pypi.org/project/requests/'"&gt;requests&lt;/a&gt; which is used to send API requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We define required variables to send a &lt;strong&gt;GET&lt;/strong&gt; request. replace &lt;strong&gt;YOUR-RAPIDAPI-KEY&lt;/strong&gt; with the key that you get on signing up for the free &lt;a href="'https://rapidapi.com/dev.vividgoat/api/csv2api1/'"&gt;API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then we send a &lt;strong&gt;GET&lt;/strong&gt; request to the API.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One that we need to keep in mind is that &lt;strong&gt;url&lt;/strong&gt; parameter in the request URL requires a raw CSV file url unlike the common link to any CSV file in Github.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here's how we get it:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Jsh32MLI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/baa78cr5xj2d6jppweng.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Jsh32MLI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/baa78cr5xj2d6jppweng.png" alt="Raw image github" width="880" height="89"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally we print what requested for!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Querying&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Querying is very important in accessing and receiving data, without it might cause numerous troubles when the application is scaled!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;receiving huge amounts data can make the app slower.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Might lead to unwanted expenses in cloud provider.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;parsing the JSON will get harder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introducing changes into the data will consume more CPU.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Makes it harder for the developer to work on the data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily we have a support for querying in CSV2API&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here's how we do it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we pass a URL parameter called &lt;code&gt;query&lt;/code&gt;, for example in our sample dataset we have columns called &lt;strong&gt;name, type, rating, goodReviews, totalScore, satisfaction, isfavourite, image, description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can query in such a way that we only get the data of a doctor with specific &lt;strong&gt;rating&lt;/strong&gt;or &lt;strong&gt;type&lt;/strong&gt;etc.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://csv2api1.p.rapidapi.com/api/v1"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;querystring&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"url"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev-Roshan-lab/healthcare/main/data.csv"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"query"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"name=='Dr. Sanjay Sachdeva' and rating==4.5"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;'x-rapidapi-host'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"csv2api1.p.rapidapi.com"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;'x-rapidapi-key'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"YOUR-RAPIDAPI-KEY"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"GET"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;querystring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the above snippet the query we passed to our database is &lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;query= name == 'Dr. Sanjay Sachdeva' and rating == 4.5&lt;/code&gt; where we are asking the API to return us the data where there name of the Doctor is Dr. Sanjay Sachdeva and his rating is 4.5. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Output:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{"results":[{" meet_id":" null"," tags":"Throat problem*Ear problem*Ear Nose Throat Diseases*Microscopic Ear Surgery*Endoscopic Nose &amp;amp; Paranasal Sinus Surgery ( Fess)*Microscopic Laryngoscopic Surgery*Sleep Disorders*Hearing Aids*Sinus Surgery*Ear Infection","description":"Dr. Sanjay Sachdeva is one of the best ENT Surgeons in Delhi with specialization in Otorhinolaryngology. He has a rich experience of 32 years in the field of ENT and Head and Neck Surgery.

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As we can see the amount just drastically reduced and comprehending is now way easier than before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precautions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;String must be passed under single quotes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boolean must be Capitalized. eg: &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt; is correct &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; is wrong similarly for True.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integers or Float should be under single quotes or double quotes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Test the API for further columns and for different data at &lt;a href="https://rapidapi.com/dev.vividgoat/api/csv2api1/"&gt;RapidAPI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got doubts or facing errors?&lt;br&gt;
Lemme see what you got, in the Discussions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--q1LtKXqu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hk4bu7uxdyho8dijrf8i.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--q1LtKXqu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hk4bu7uxdyho8dijrf8i.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="404"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 . create react app&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ npx create-react-app project_name
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;5 . Install EmailJS library&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ npm install @emailjs/browser --save
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;6 . Create contact form&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;ref=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;{form}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;onSubmit=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;{sendMail}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'contact-form'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"text"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"form-input"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"name"&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="na"&gt;placeholder=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'your name'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"text"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"form-input"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"subject"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;placeholder=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'subject'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"email"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"form-input"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"email"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;placeholder=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'youremail'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"message"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"form-input"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"message"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;placeholder=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'message'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"submit"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'form-button'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;value=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Send Mail"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;useRef() hook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Note - The useRef is a hook that allows to directly create a reference to the DOM element in the functional component.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Result -&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;[Log] &amp;lt;form class="contact-form"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;input type="text" class="form-input" name="name" placeholder="your name"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;input type="text" class="form-input" name="subject" placeholder="subject"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;input type="email" class="form-input" name="email" placeholder="youremail"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;input type="message" class="form-input" name="message" placeholder="message"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;input type="submit" class="form-button" value="Send Mail"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;7 . Now call emailjs.sendForm()&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;emailjs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sendForm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;YOUR_SERVICE_ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;YOUR_USER_ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This function generate email message and send it to your mail id.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My 2021 Year in Review</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like last year, 2021 has been quite the year. Despite the pandemic, I stayed healthy and managed to have a pretty good year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reply to Nader Dabit's Tweet sum up a lot of my year, but let's break it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#talks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Talks
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gave four talks. Were these conference talks? Most were lunch and learns, but I also had a Hacktoberfest talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first talk of the year was for &lt;a href="https://the-collab-lab.codes/"&gt;The Collab Lab&lt;/a&gt;. I went over what Storybook is and how you can use it in your application. I even did a live coding session demonstrating its use in one of The Collab Lab cohort's projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ypsD-9qQzYg"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the accompanying &lt;a href="https://www.iamdeveloper.com/storybook2021"&gt;slide deck&lt;/a&gt; and blog post for the talk.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="/nickytonline/storybook-talk-live-coding-klp" class="ltag__link__link"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ltag__link__content"&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;Storybook Talk / Live Coding&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;Nick Taylor ・ Mar 16 ・ 2 min read&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;div class="ltag__link__taglist"&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#javascript&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#react&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#storybook&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#ux&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Collab Lab was looking for more mentors recently, so I offered to mentor. I'm looking forward to meeting my cohort in Q2! Let's go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second talk of the year was a lunch and learn for my favourite community, &lt;a href="https://virtualcoffee.io"&gt;Virtual Coffee&lt;/a&gt;! It was all about debugging JavaScript. From console.log to debugger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the accompanying &lt;a href="https://iamdeveloper.com/debug2021"&gt;slide deck&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up was another lunch and learn for Virtual Coffee, "Getting Started with Streaming on Twitch". A lot of folks were interested in streaming and learning in public, so I shared what I had learnt after one year of streaming on Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the accompanying &lt;a href="https://iamdeveloper.com/stream2021"&gt;slide deck&lt;/a&gt; and blog post for the talk. Check out the blog post, as there was stuff I didn't have time to mention or forgot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My last talk of the year was for Hacktoberfest. The AppWrite team approached me to talk about open source, and I was happy to oblige.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gave two workshops at Codeland 2021! The first one was about contributing to open source with my awesome co-worker Arit Amana.&lt;/p&gt;

  Making an Impact at Work
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's funny how this section of my year in review is short, but nonetheless, I made some big impacts at work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got end-to-end (E2E) testing in place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revived Gitpod in time for Hacktoberfest for Forem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mentored and paired a tonne&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shipped features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worked a lot with the community (we're open source)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#streaming-and-live-coding"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Streaming and Live Coding
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, I streamed a bunch with my co-worker Christina on the &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thepracticaldev"&gt;DEV Twitch stream&lt;/a&gt;, but I also got back into streaming more on &lt;a href="https://livecoding.ca"&gt;my channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in checking out the back catalogue of DEV Twitch streams, check out the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/ThePracticalDevTeam"&gt;DEV YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have &lt;a href="https://youtube.iamdeveloper.com"&gt;my own YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; where some of my streams persist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#explored-web3"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Explored Web3
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won't link to all the projects I've done in this space (you can check out &lt;a href="https://github.com/nickytonline"&gt;my GitHub profile&lt;/a&gt;, but I will link to one project since it's modestly popular. I created a web3 starter project template.&lt;/p&gt;

yarn&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start the project&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell position-relative overflow-auto js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;npm run dev
&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; or&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open &lt;a href="http://localhost:3000" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://localhost:3000&lt;/a&gt; with your browser to see the
result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Getting Started (Gitpod)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project can be run in Gitpod. Navigate to
&lt;a href="https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/nickytonline/hello-edge-and-node" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/nickytonline/hello-edge-and-node&lt;/a&gt;. If you
wish to load it in Gitpod as an external contributor, you will need to fork the
project first, then open the fork in Gitpod, e.g.
&lt;a href="https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/some_user_that_forked_the_repository/hello-edge-and-node" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/some_user_that_forked_the_repository/hello-edge-and-node&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gitpod will take a minute or two to load.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If this is the first time…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="gh-btn-container"&gt;&lt;a class="gh-btn" href="https://github.com/nickytonline/web3-starter"&gt;View on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in web3, definitely check out &lt;a href="https://buildspace.so"&gt;Buildspace&lt;/a&gt; and consider joining a DAO like &lt;a href="https://www.developerdao.com/"&gt;Developer DAO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm still exploring this controversial space, but all I can say for now is &lt;br&gt;
it's been fun exploring the tech and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

  Podcasts
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021 was the year of podcasts for me. Before 2021, I had never been a guest on a podcast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to my favourite community, Virtual Coffee, &lt;a href="https://virtualcoffee.io/podcast/0101-nickyt/"&gt;I had the privilege of being the podcast's first guest&lt;/a&gt;. It was awesome chilling with my friends Bekah and Dan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on in the year, I got to hang with my co-worker Ben Halpern, Jonathan Carter, principal program manager at Microsoft, and Cassidy Williams, director of developer experience at Netlify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We discussed Visual Studio Code and all things related to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the fall, &lt;a href="https://candost.blog/"&gt;Candost Dagdeviren&lt;/a&gt; reached out to me on &lt;a href="https://timeline.iamdeveloper.com"&gt;Polywork&lt;/a&gt; about being a guest on their podcast. It was a great discussion. Check out episode #25,  &lt;a href="https://candost.blog/podcast/sw-25-live-pair-programming-open-source-and-building-communities-with-nick-taylor/"&gt;Live Pair Programming, Open Source, and Building Communities with Nick Taylor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to round off the year of podcasts, I got to hang with my co-workers Ben Halpern and Arit Amana, along with Michael Boroff, mental health program manager at Crossover Health to discuss imposter syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#working-out"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Working Out 💪🏻
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since gyms are closed, I built a garage gym. It's not huge, but it lets me put in the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I trained consistently this year, typically 3 one hour HIIT sessions/week. I say typically because  I was on vacation (pandemic vacation) for parts of the year, and a few of the weeks might have been one or two sessions only due to appointments or some anomaly in my regular schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only did this keep me sane, it just all around made me feel better. Since I train at 7 am, it's also a great way to start the day feeling energized and having a clear head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm still not where I want to be, but it feels great working out consistently again as year one of the pandemic derailed my training. Also, after performing thousands of lunges this year and all kinds of single limb training, my body is snowboard-ready. 🏂🏻&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#fun-stuff"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Fun Stuff
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rebuilt my backyard rink. It's a little wider this year and twice as tall. I ran into issues mid-winter last year where the ice ended up being at the same height as the walls. I had to use scraps of wood; I had to make it taller along with snow and ice. It worked but making it twice as tall this year will avoid all that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it started&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
