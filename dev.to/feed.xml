      <guid>https://dev.to/cloudtech/iaas-vs-paas-vs-saas-41d2</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;An increasing number of businesses are choosing cloud services. If you aren’t familiar with this topic, cloud computing is when hardware (servers, storage, etc.) and software are delivered over the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to on-premises hardware and software, cloud-based solutions such as IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS offer several major benefits. Let’s briefly mention these benefits in order to understand why cloud computing is so popular in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ScJE94JU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jkfnnrt8lw0ijnf8hlk1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ScJE94JU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jkfnnrt8lw0ijnf8hlk1.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Background: Cloud Engineer | AWS Community Builder | AWS Educate Cloud Ambassador | 4x AWS Certified | 3x OCI Certified | 3x Azure Certified.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#scalability"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Scalability.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On-premises solutions are rather difficult to scale, as the type of hardware needed depends on your application’s demands. If your app experiences heavy traffic, you might need to significantly upgrade on-premises hardware. This problem doesn’t exist with a cloud service, which you can quickly scale up or down with a few clicks. Cloud services are a perfect solution for handling peak loads. With cloud-based services, businesses can use whatever computing resources they need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#costeffectiveness"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cost-effectiveness.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing removes hardware expenses, as hardware is provided by a vendor. There’s no need to buy, install, configure, and maintain servers, databases, and other components of your runtime environment. Moreover, using cloud-based solutions, you pay only for what you use, so if you don’t need extra resources you can simply scale down and not pay for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#immediate-availability"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Immediate availability.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud solutions are available as soon as you’ve paid for them, so you can start using a cloud service right away. There’s no need to install and configure hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#performance"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Performance.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud companies equip their data centers with high-performance computing infrastructure that guarantees low network latency for your applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#security"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Security.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud infrastructure is kept in safe data centers to ensure a top level of security. Data is backed up and can easily be recovered. Moreover, cloud vendors ensure the security of your data by using networking firewalls, encryption, and sophisticated tools for detecting cybercrime and fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantages of cloud solutions are huge, so it stands to reason that the cloud services market is booming. According to a forecast by Gartner, the global public cloud services market is expected to reach almost $247 billion this year and grow to over $383 billion by 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#global-market-of-public-cloud-services"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Global Market of Public Cloud Services
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet choosing the right cloud service can be rather challenging. Many people have no idea what SaaS, IaaS, and PaaS mean or which of these cloud solutions they need for their projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-do-iaas-paas-and-saas-mean"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What do IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS mean?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three major types of cloud services: IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. You’ve probably seen these abbreviations on the websites of cloud providers. Before going into details, let’s compare IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS to transportation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cloud-services-compared-to-means-of-transport"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cloud Services Compared to Means of Transport
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On-premises IT infrastructure is like owning a car.&lt;/strong&gt; When you buy a car, you’re responsible for its maintenance, and upgrading means buying a new car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IaaS is like leasing a car.&lt;/strong&gt; When you lease a car, you choose the car you want and drive it wherever you wish, but the car isn’t yours. Want an upgrade? Just lease a different car!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PaaS is like taking a taxi.&lt;/strong&gt; You don’t drive a taxi yourself, but simply tell the driver where you need to go and relax in the back seat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SaaS is like going by bus.&lt;/strong&gt; Buses have assigned routes, and you share the ride with other passengers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These analogies will help you better understand our more detailed explanations. Let’s give a definition to each of these terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_p2Je-KI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/iykkvc6hbo6rfrkea686.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_p2Je-KI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/iykkvc6hbo6rfrkea686.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#software-as-a-service-saas"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Software as a Service (SaaS)
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SaaS allows people to use cloud-based web applications.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, email services such as Gmail and Hotmail are examples of cloud-based SaaS services. Other examples of SaaS services are office tools (Office 365 and Google Docs), customer relationship management software (Salesforce), event management software (Planning Pod), and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SaaS services are usually available with a pay-as-you-go (which means subscription) pricing model. All software and hardware are provided and managed by a vendor, so you don’t need to install or configure anything. The application is ready to go as soon as you get your login and password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#software-as-a-service-saas"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#platform-as-a-service-paas"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Platform as a Service (PaaS)
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PaaS refers to cloud platforms that provide runtime environments for developing, testing, and managing applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to PaaS solutions, software developers can deploy applications, from simple to sophisticated, without needing all the related infrastructure (servers, databases, operating systems, development tools, etc). Examples of PaaS services are Heroku and Google App Engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PaaS vendors supply a complete infrastructure for application development, while developers are in charge of the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like SaaS, Platform as a Service solutions are available with a pay-as-you-go pricing model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#platform-as-a-service-paas"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Platform as a Service (PaaS)

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#infrastructure-as-a-service-iaas"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IaaS is a cloud service that provides basic computing infrastructure: servers, storage, and networking resources. In other words, IaaS is a virtual data center.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IaaS services can be used for a variety of purposes, from hosting websites to analyzing big data. Clients can install and use whatever operating systems and tools they like on the infrastructure they get. Major IaaS providers include Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Compute Engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with SaaS and PaaS, IaaS services are available on a pay-for-what-you-use model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#infrastructure-as-a-service-iaas"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
&lt;/h1&gt;

Hosted applications Servers and storage&lt;br&gt;

Perfect for: IT administrators&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, each cloud service (IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS) is tailored to the business needs of its target audience. From the technical point of view, IaaS gives you the most control but requires extensive expertise to manage the computing infrastructure, while SaaS allows you to use cloud-based applications without needing to manage the underlying infrastructure. Cloud services, thus, can be depicted as a pyramid:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#iaas-paas-saas-hierarchy-diagram"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  IaaS, PaaS, SaaS Hierarchy Diagram
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that &lt;strong&gt;you know what SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS mean&lt;/strong&gt;, let’s be more specific about when each should be used and &lt;strong&gt;what their advantages and disadvantages are.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#when-and-why-you-should-use-saas"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  When and Why You Should Use SaaS
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve already mentioned some examples of SaaS solutions, so you have a general understanding of when they’re used. Let’s provide some more details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#saas-solutions-can-be-used-for"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  SaaS solutions can be used for:
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal purposes.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millions of individuals all over the world use email services (Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo), cloud storage services (Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive), cloud-based file management services (Google Docs), and so on. People may not realize it, but all of these cloud services are actually SaaS services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies of various sizes may use SaaS solutions such as corporate email services (Gmail is available for businesses, for example), collaboration tools (Trello), customer relationship management software (Salesforce, Zoho), event management software (EventPro, Cvent), and enterprise resource planning software (SAP S/4HANA Cloud ERP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SaaS services offer plenty of advantages to individuals and businesses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Access to applications from anywhere.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike on-premises software, which can be accessed only from a computer (or a network) it’s installed on, SaaS solutions are cloud-based. Thus, you can access them from anywhere there’s internet access, be it your company’s office or a hotel room.&lt;br&gt;
Can be used from any device. Cloud-based SaaS services can be accessed from any computer. You only need to sign in. Many SaaS solutions have mobile apps, so they can be accessed from mobile devices as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automatic software updates.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to bother updating your SaaS software, as updates are carried out by a cloud service vendor. If there are any bugs or technical troubles, the vendor will fix them while you focus on your work instead of on software maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low cost.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to on-premises software, SaaS services are rather affordable. There’s no need to pay for the whole IT infrastructure; you pay only for the service at the scale you need. If you need extra functionality, you can always update your subscription.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simple adoption.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SaaS services are available out-of-the-box, so adopting them is a piece of cake. We’ve already mentioned what you need to do: just sign up. It’s as simple as that. There’s no need to install anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, SaaS solutions have certain disadvantages as well, so let’s mention a couple of them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have no control over the hardware that handles your data.&lt;br&gt;
Only a vendor can manage the parameters of the software you’re using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#when-and-why-you-should-use-paas"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  When and Why You Should Use PaaS
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PaaS solutions are used mostly by software developers. PaaS provides an environment for developing, testing, and managing applications. PaaS is therefore the perfect choice for software development companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No wonder that software developers use &lt;strong&gt;PaaS services such as Heroku, Elastic Beanstalk (offered by Amazon Web Services), and Google App Engine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PaaS provides a number of benefits to developers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#reduced-development-time"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Reduced development time.
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PaaS services allow software developers to significantly reduce development time. Server-side components of the computing infrastructure (web servers, storage, networking resources, etc.) are provided by a vendor, so development teams don’t need to configure, maintain, or update them. Instead, developers can focus on delivering projects with top speed and quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support for different programming languages.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PaaS cloud services usually support multiple programming languages, giving developers an opportunity to deliver various projects, from startup MVPs to enterprise solutions, on the same platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easy collaboration for remote and distributed teams.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PaaS gives enormous collaboration capabilities to remote and distributed teams. Outsourcing and freelancing are common today, and many software development teams are comprised of specialists who live in different parts of the world. PaaS services allow them to access the same software architecture from anywhere and at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High development capabilities without additional staff.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PaaS provides development companies with everything they need to create applications without the necessity of hiring additional staff. All hardware and middleware is provided, maintained, and upgraded by a PaaS vendor, which means businesses don’t need staff to configure servers and databases or deploy operating systems.&lt;br&gt;
Of course, PaaS cloud services have certain disadvantages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have no control over the virtual machine that’s processing your data.&lt;br&gt;
PaaS solutions are less flexible than IaaS. For example, you can’t create and delete several virtual machines at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#when-and-why-you-should-use-iaas"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  When and Why You Should Use IaaS
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IaaS solutions can be used for multiple purposes. Unlike SaaS and PaaS, IaaS provides hardware infrastructure that you can use in a variety of ways. It’s like having a set of tools that you can use for constructing the item you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#here-are-several-scenarios-when-you-can-use-iaas"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Here are several scenarios when you can use IaaS:
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Website or application hosting.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can run your website or application with the help of IaaS (for example, using Elastic Compute Cloud from Amazon Web Services).&lt;br&gt;
Virtual data centers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IaaS is the best solution for building virtual data centers for large-scale enterprises that need an effective, scalable, and safe server environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data analysis.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyzing huge amounts of data requires incredible computing power, and IaaS is the most economical way to get it. Companies use Infrastructure as a Service for data mining and analysis.&lt;br&gt;
Infrastructure as a Service provides the following major advantages for businesses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No expenses on hardware infrastructure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IaaS vendors provide and maintain hardware infrastructure: servers, storage, and networking resources. This means that businesses don’t need to invest in expensive hardware, which is a substantial cost savings as IT hardware infrastructure is rather pricey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perfect scalability.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though all cloud-based solutions are scalable, this is particularly true of Infrastructure as a Service, as additional resources are available to your application in case of higher demand. Apps can also be scaled down if demand is low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reliability and security.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensuring the safety of your data is a IaaS vendor’s responsibility. Hardware infrastructure is usually kept in specially designed data centers, and a cloud provider guarantees security of your data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, let’s specify the disadvantages of IaaS cloud solutions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IaaS is more expensive than SaaS or PaaS, as you in fact lease hardware infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All issues related to the management of a virtual machine are your responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#iaas-vs-paas-vs-saas-which-cloud-service-is-suitable-for-you"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  IaaS vs PaaS vs SaaS: Which Cloud Service Is Suitable for You?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s time to pick which cloud-based service you need. In fact, the choice totally depends on your business goals, so first of all consider what your company needs. Here are some common business needs that can easily be met with the appropriate cloud service:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your business needs out-of-the-box software (CRM, email, collaboration tools, etc.), choose Software as a Service.&lt;br&gt;
If your company requires a platform for building software products, pick Platform as a Service.&lt;br&gt;
If your business needs a virtual machine, opt for Infrastructure as a Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pzKkXZze--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fyrxb4579f2boiadyyoy.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pzKkXZze--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fyrxb4579f2boiadyyoy.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I decided to put a GitHub repo with a learning path, resources, and projects, I would take to gain a junior cloud engineer skillset in about 6 months. Here it is.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag-github-readme-tag"&gt;
  &lt;div class="readme-overview"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;
      &lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--i3JOwpme--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev.to/assets/github-logo-ba8488d21cd8ee1fee097b8410db9deaa41d0ca30b004c0c63de0a479114156f.svg" alt="GitHub logo"&gt;
      &lt;a href="https://github.com/madebygps"&gt;
        madebygps
      &lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://github.com/madebygps/self-taught-guide-to-cloud-computing"&gt;
        self-taught-guide-to-cloud-computing
      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;
      My self taught guide to cloud computing.
    &lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="ltag-github-body"&gt;
    
&lt;div id="readme" class="md"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
Learn the fundamentals of Cloud Computing in 6 months&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/madebygps/self-taught-guide-to-cloud-computing/main/img/timeline.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eF5B_3Pa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/madebygps/self-taught-guide-to-cloud-computing/main/img/timeline.png" alt="Timeline"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ts9vNsrJypE" rel="nofollow"&gt;Watch the guide here&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the learning path we would take if we had to start over again and work our way up to a junior cloud engineer skill set in about 6 months. Any links you see ARE NOT AFFILIATE LINKS, we don't want your money. Okay, let's go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/madebygps/self-taught-guide-to-cloud-computing/main/phase1/README.md"&gt;Go to Phase 1: Linux and Networking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Note&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a guide based on our experiences of going from help desk to Cloud and DevOps engineers. You journey is yours and you may need to learn different things at different stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tried to keep it as general and using the most popular options (in terms of content, community, and jobs) as possible. Mainly because these things are important when you're getting started. As you grow, you'll need to get specialized in certain areas :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Study tips and resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="gh-btn-container"&gt;&lt;a class="gh-btn" href="https://github.com/madebygps/self-taught-guide-to-cloud-computing"&gt;View on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I also created a YouTube video with an overview of the guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ts9vNsrJypE"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is based on my own experience. Your journey is yours. However, I still wanted to share in case anyone finds something useful. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Create a TypeScript Project with ExpressJS the Simplest Way!!</title>
      <author>SilvenLEAF</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 Jun 2021 02:47:34 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/silvenleaf/how-to-create-a-typescript-project-with-expressjs-the-simplest-way-578a</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/silvenleaf/how-to-create-a-typescript-project-with-expressjs-the-simplest-way-578a</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are wondering how to create a TypeScript BackEND project, fear not my brave knight. It's way easier than you can ever imagine!! Let go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-1"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 1
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First init our project by running &lt;strong&gt;npm init -y&lt;/strong&gt; on our terminal, it'll create a package.json file. Then let's install these packages by running the following command on our terminal&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm i typescript ts-node express @types/node @types/express
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;typescript is the core package for typescript, ts-node is the node version for runnig .ts files just as we do with node app.js, in this case we do, ts-node app.ts. @types/node and @types/express has all the types for node and express respectively. You say why? Well typescript is all about type na :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#bonus-step"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Bonus Step
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let's install some helping dev stuff&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm i --D nodemon ts-node-dev
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ts-node-dev package binds nodemon with typescript. The typescript version for &lt;strong&gt;nodemon app.js&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;ts-node-dev app.ts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let's update our package.json file&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;....keep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;others&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;unchanged&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"main"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"app.ts"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"scripts"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"start"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"ts-node app.ts"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"dev"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"ts-node-dev app.ts"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;...keep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;others&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;unchanged&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-2"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 2
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run the following command, it'll will create a tsconfig.json file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;tsc --init
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-3"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 3
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's create an express App&lt;br&gt;
Write these on the app.ts file that we created&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;




&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// -------------------firing express app&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;urlencoded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;extended&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;__dirname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;client/build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)));&lt;/span&gt;




&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// -------------------routes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;/home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Welcome to the home page!`&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// --------------------Listen&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PORT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;PORT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Server running on PORT &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PORT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yippie, our very first typescript express app is ready. Let's run and test it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Type either &lt;strong&gt;npm start&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;npm run dev&lt;/strong&gt; and then go to the &lt;strong&gt;localhost:5000&lt;/strong&gt; and test it out yourself. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Deploying SvelteKit using Cloudflare Workers</title>
      <author>Ashley Connor</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 Jun 2021 00:20:44 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/ashleyconnor/deploying-sveltekit-using-cloudflare-workers-16ni</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/ashleyconnor/deploying-sveltekit-using-cloudflare-workers-16ni</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I've been using SvelteKit as the frontend for a project I've been working on and after some local development I wanted to get it up and&lt;br&gt;
running on the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose &lt;a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/"&gt;Cloudflare Workers&lt;/a&gt; as I already have an account with them (this blog is hosted on &lt;a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com/"&gt;Cloudflare Pages&lt;/a&gt;) however, the documentation on using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/adapter-cloudflare-workers"&gt;adapter-cloudflare-workers&lt;/a&gt; is pretty sparse so I'll cover how I got it deployed here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sveltekit-adapter-configuration"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  SvelteKit adapter configuration
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't have an existing SvelteKit project you can follow allowing by generating the demo project:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;npm init svelte@next my-cloudflare-workers-demo
? Which Svelte app template? › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
❯   SvelteKit demo app &lt;span class="c"&gt;# select this&lt;/span&gt;
    Skeleton project
✔ Use TypeScript? … No / Yes
✔ Add ESLint &lt;span class="k"&gt;for &lt;/span&gt;code linting? … No / Yes
✔ Add Prettier &lt;span class="k"&gt;for &lt;/span&gt;code formatting? … No / Yes
✔ Copied project files

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;my-cloudflare-workers-demo
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;npm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once you're at the root of your project we can install the adapter:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;npm i @sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare-workers@next
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, let's configure the adapter in our &lt;code&gt;svelte.config.js&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// first import the adapter&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;adapter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare-workers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// then in the config object, add an adapter key under kit, and call the imported library&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;kit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// hydrate the &amp;lt;div id="svelte"&amp;gt; element in src/app.html&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;#svelte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;adapter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;adapter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That's all that's required from SvelteKit. Now onto the Cloudflare Workers configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#wrangler"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Wrangler
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#configuration"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Configuration
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To deploy to Cloudflare we will install the &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler/install-update"&gt;Wrangler CLI&lt;/a&gt; tool and generating an empty configuration:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;npm i @cloudflare/wrangler &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-g&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;wrangler init &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--site&lt;/span&gt; my-cloudflare-workers-demo
🕵️  You can find your zone_id &lt;span class="k"&gt;in &lt;/span&gt;the right sidebar of a zone&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'s overview tab at https://dash.cloudflare.com
🕵️  You can find your account_id in the right sidebar of your account'&lt;/span&gt;s Workers page
🕵️  You will need to update the following fields &lt;span class="k"&gt;in &lt;/span&gt;the created wrangler.toml file before continuing:
- account_id
✨  Successfully scaffolded workers site
✨  Successfully created a &lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;wrangler.toml&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now let's follow the instructions given and login to our &lt;a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com"&gt;Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt; dashboard to find our &lt;code&gt;account_id&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Login and then click on the "Workers" menu item on the right-hand side of the page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Y1BUvIXS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ff8qdpaczsuoauluf129.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Y1BUvIXS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ff8qdpaczsuoauluf129.png" alt="Cloudflare Workers menu item"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copy your Account ID from the sidebar:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--m4W2FLar--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sh6aczit734ld1oelqnw.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--m4W2FLar--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sh6aczit734ld1oelqnw.png" alt="Account ID"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optionally if you have a domain setup with Cloudflare that you wish to use with your Cloudflare Workers, grab the &lt;code&gt;zone_id&lt;/code&gt; from your domain's dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now edit your &lt;code&gt;wrangler.toml&lt;/code&gt; configuration file with those values:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight toml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="py"&gt;account_id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'4b05422c8548d995a6132421d4c31bba'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="py"&gt;zone_id&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'2ea755fa5c01136f1d07a2013c2d1c6f'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c"&gt;# optional, if you don't specify this a workers.dev subdomain will be used.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, we also need to make some adjustments to the &lt;code&gt;site&lt;/code&gt; key pointing it to the directories that will be generated by running build stage later on.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight toml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;site&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="py"&gt;bucket&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"./build"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="py"&gt;entry-point&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"./workers-site"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#authorization"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Authorization
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, let's authorize our Wrangler client so we can deploy our project:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;wrangler login
Allow Wrangler to open a page &lt;span class="k"&gt;in &lt;/span&gt;your browser? &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;y/n]
y
💁  Opened a &lt;span class="nb"&gt;link &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;in &lt;/span&gt;your default browser: https://dash.cloudflare.com/wrangler?key&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;...
💁  Validating credentials...
✨  Successfully configured. You can find your configuration file at: /Users/ashleyconnor/.wrangler/config/default.toml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#build-our-project-and-deploy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Build our project and deploy
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we need to build our project which we can do using &lt;code&gt;npm run build&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;npm run build

&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; my-cloudflare-workers-demo@0.0.1 build
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; svelte-kit build

  ✔ &lt;span class="k"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then run the &lt;code&gt;wrangler publish&lt;/code&gt; command:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;wrangler publish
up to &lt;span class="nb"&gt;date &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;in &lt;/span&gt;0.729s

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Your Server Side Rendered SvelteKit application should be up and running on the URL above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can visit the demo SvelteKit application running on Cloudflare Workers &lt;a href="https://my-cloudflare-workers-demo.ashconnor.workers.dev"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Saas: La metodología de 12 factores explicada</title>
      <author>Carlos Loredo</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 Jun 2021 00:13:26 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/loboaveces/saas-la-metodologia-de-12-factores-explicada-3ip2</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/loboaveces/saas-la-metodologia-de-12-factores-explicada-3ip2</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;La metodología de doce-factores es una metodología para crear aplicaciones de software como servicio (Saas). Consta de  algunas "mejores prácticas" diseñadas para permitir que las aplicaciones web se creen con portabilidad y resiliencia.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--83UDMaL8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8uyn56ay1tf8dsc5o7ej.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--83UDMaL8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8uyn56ay1tf8dsc5o7ej.jpg" alt="12-factores_img"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Para comprender esta metodología podemos dividir los doce factores en 3 componentes clave:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xArfJeCt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mop1e47n55jgyzp5ugzm.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xArfJeCt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mop1e47n55jgyzp5ugzm.png" alt="12-factores-3-componentes"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A continuación, veremos las mejores prácticas que se debe seguir en cada factor para que nuestra aplicación cumpla con esta metodología.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#factores-de-c%C3%B3digo"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Factores de código:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#factor-1-c%C3%B3digo-base"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Factor 1 - Código base:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--k1qMpU9d--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/88bat7esyojurnh3a8eu.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--k1qMpU9d--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/88bat7esyojurnh3a8eu.png" alt="codebase_img"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Se debe hacer seguimiento a los cambios en el código desden un sistema de control de versiones (VCS) como Github, BitBucket, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relación uno a uno entre el código base y la aplicación.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Puede haber múltiples implementaciones de la aplicación.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pueden haber diferentes versiones del código base en cada implementación.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#factor-5-compila-publica-y-ejecuta"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Factor 5: Compila, publica y ejecuta:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Ul0L5ykL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nqdkfa5ujzqt3hlctzj8.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Ul0L5ykL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nqdkfa5ujzqt3hlctzj8.png" alt="build_release_run_img"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build (Compilación): transforma un código base en una unidad ejecutable llamada build.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Release (Lanzamiento): Combina el build con la configuración para que esté listo para ejecutarse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ejecución: ejecuta la aplicación.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#factor-10-paridad-devprod"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Factor 10 - Paridad Dev/Prod:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IgRTzYKj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4pcf5i767q74tvl8alwp.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IgRTzYKj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4pcf5i767q74tvl8alwp.png" alt="dev_prod_img"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimiza las diferencias entre los entornos de implementación y producción.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Los servicios de back-end deben ser los mismos en todos los entornos (dev/prod).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#factores-de-implementaci%C3%B3n"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Factores de implementación:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#factor-2-dependencias"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Factor 2 - Dependencias:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ucqBffgk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nwo8742ttq3rbi120am5.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ucqBffgk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nwo8742ttq3rbi120am5.jpeg" alt="dependencia_img"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ten en cuenta que una aplicación solo es confiable como su dependencia menos confiable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asegúrate de que el código declare explícitamente cualquier dependencia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#factor-3-configuraci%C3%B3n"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Factor 3 - Configuración:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--p_IxD_oP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8tivn8wk9v1yvqarq47c.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--p_IxD_oP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8tivn8wk9v1yvqarq47c.png" alt="config_img"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;La configuración contiene todo lo que varía entre las implementaciones, como las credenciales y las ubicaciones de los servicios de respaldo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Las configuraciones deben mantenerse separadas del código&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Almacena la configuración en variables de entorno.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#factor-4-servicios-de-backend"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Factor 4 - Servicios de back-end:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4YPxemg_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r94g7io1nlu15tdsocq7.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4YPxemg_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r94g7io1nlu15tdsocq7.png" alt="back_end_img"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Las aplicaciones no deben distinguir entre servicios de back-end locales y de terceros.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Se debe acceder a todos los servicios mediante URLs y credenciales para que puedan intercambiarse sin cambiar el código.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#factor-6-procesos"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Factor 6 - Procesos:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KpGrb16t--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7hcklo53ws070o5i0srs.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KpGrb16t--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7hcklo53ws070o5i0srs.png" alt="process_img"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Stateless" y no comparten nada.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Los servicios de respaldo almacenan datos persistentes ya que la memoria y los sistemas de archivos no se comparten entre los procesos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Los datos se almacenan de forma centralizada.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#factor-7-enlace-a-trav%C3%A9s-de-puertos"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Factor 7 - Enlace a través de puertos:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LzV24ftG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/67qg3oel4zzh9bxw1980.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LzV24ftG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/67qg3oel4zzh9bxw1980.png" alt="ports_img"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exportación de servicios designando un puerto. HTTP y otros servicios se exportan de esta manera.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Para vincular un puerto normalmente debe declarar una biblioteca de servidor web.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Las aplicaciones pueden ser servicios que sean llamadas por otras aplicaciones a través de la URL y el puerto.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#factor-9-desechabilidad"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Factor 9 - Desechabilidad:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--l4CVczc6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/po4etp9xuwa9543758a3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--l4CVczc6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/po4etp9xuwa9543758a3.png" alt="disposability_img"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Las aplicaciones deben tener un tiempo de inicio de proceso mínimo y un cierre o terminación de la applicación eficiente.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementar código y configurar cambios rápidamente.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Escale aplicaciones fácilmente.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#factor-11-registros-logs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Factor 11 - Registros (logs):
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--598r2wTP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b7y490pmgjd6yljdfnyx.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--598r2wTP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b7y490pmgjd6yljdfnyx.png" alt="logs_img"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Las aplicaciones no deben preocuparse por almacenar registros (logs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Las aplicaciones deben tener registros de tendencias en forma de un flujo de eventos escrito en stdout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;El entorno de ejecución captura el flujo de todas las aplicaciones, agrega los registros y enruta los registros a su destino.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#factores-operativos"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Factores operativos:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#factor-8-simultaneidad"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Factor 8 - Simultaneidad:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--a8vgmFba--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4xlapzhnskergfq9tqs7.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--a8vgmFba--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4xlapzhnskergfq9tqs7.png" alt="concurrency_img"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Se pueden utilizar procesos concurrentes para escalar la aplicación.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Los procesos sin estado se pueden activar sin crear dependencias en otros procesos.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Developed an app to transcribe and translate from images</title>
      <author>Yuiko Ito</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/yuiko/developed-an-app-to-transcribe-and-translate-from-images-32gp</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey guys,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I developed an application that you can easily get a transcription and translation from images. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gyazo.com/eec97dbffb7364afd24f2e9a2e0372b8"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7Dcyae1f--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://i.gyazo.com/eec97dbffb7364afd24f2e9a2e0372b8.gif" alt="Image from Gyazo"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;URL→&lt;a href="https://pictranslator.info/"&gt;https://pictranslator.info/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This article is the fifth week of trying to write at least one article every week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Past articles are listed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/yuiko/face-detection-by-using-tensorflow-react-typescript-3dn5"&gt;React + TypeScript: Face detection with Tensorflow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/yuiko/ui-components-website-released-2g8e"&gt;UI Components website Released!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/yuiko/i-made-18-ui-components-for-all-developers-17l6"&gt;I made 18 UI components for all developers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/yuiko/image-transformation-convert-pictures-to-add-styles-from-famous-paintings-24ml"&gt;Image Transformation: Convert pictures to add styles from famous paintings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#functions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Functions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatically gets the language of the user's browser and sets it as the default language. (EN, DE, FR, ZH, JA)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transcribe with the click of a button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Translates to the default language (the language of the user's browser) with the click of a button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If need to change the language, it is possible to change the language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transcribed or translated text can be easily copied with the click of a button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#points-to-consider"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Points to consider
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to make it as simple as possible! So, you can understand it without any description.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, it looks like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Pq4QPpdy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jzjeckxcs571sv6uplqa.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Pq4QPpdy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jzjeckxcs571sv6uplqa.png" alt="スクリーンショット 2021-06-20 21.46.29"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you drag an image, you can select the Transcribe or Translate button like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--N2GoBlGO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vdrmw6j273omryhe6ev4.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--N2GoBlGO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vdrmw6j273omryhe6ev4.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially my application needed selected which language you want to translate.&lt;br&gt;
However, I was wondering if I wanted to translate an image, it might be bother to select language before translating. If your browser language is English, of course you want to translate to English, not to Japanese, Chinese or others. So I decided to make it possible to translate into the user's browser language with just one button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, if the language displayed is different from your native language (or the language you want to translate is different), you can use the button on the upper right to convert it to a different language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need to translate or transcribe from images, please use this!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I posted this to Product Hunt!↓&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/pic-translator"&gt;https://www.producthunt.com/posts/pic-translator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌖🌖🌖🌖🌖🌖🌖🌖&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading!&lt;br&gt;
I would be really grad if you use this website and give me any feedback!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🍎🍎🍎🍎🍎🍎&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to prepare custom image dataset, split as train set &amp; test set and build a CNN model using Keras?</title>
      <author>Danyson</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 Jun 2021 00:05:14 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/danyson/how-to-prepare-custom-image-dataset-split-as-train-set-test-set-and-build-a-cnn-model-using-keras-47jo</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/danyson/how-to-prepare-custom-image-dataset-split-as-train-set-test-set-and-build-a-cnn-model-using-keras-47jo</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine you have two class of images, &lt;code&gt;Class_A  &amp;amp;  Class_B&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you need a custom dataset with &lt;code&gt;train set and test set&lt;/code&gt; for training and validation of our image data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to use Keras for our Dataset generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--oehC6jkK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3khw7fhhky3awl8atgnz.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--oehC6jkK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3khw7fhhky3awl8atgnz.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
----------------------------------&lt;code&gt;logo:keras.io&lt;/code&gt;----------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#steps-in-creating-the-directory-for-images"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Steps in creating the directory for images:
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create folder named &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create folders &lt;code&gt;train&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;validation&lt;/code&gt; as subfolders inside folder &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create folders &lt;code&gt;class_A&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;class_B&lt;/code&gt; as subfolders inside &lt;code&gt;train&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;validation&lt;/code&gt; folders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place 80% class_A images in &lt;code&gt;data/train/class_A&lt;/code&gt; folder path.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place 20% class_A imagess in `data/validation/class_A folder path.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place 80% class_B images in &lt;code&gt;data/train/class_B&lt;/code&gt; folder path.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place 20% class_B imagess in &lt;code&gt;data/validation/class_B&lt;/code&gt; folder path.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#directory-structure"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Directory structure.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;`&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;data/
    train/
        class_A/
            class_A001.jpg
            class_A002.jpg
            .
            .
            .
        class_B/
            class_B001.jpg
            class_B002.jpg
             .
             .
             .
    validation/
        class_A/
            class_A001.jpg
            class_A002.jpg
             .
             .
             .
        class_B/
            class_B001.jpg
            class_B002.jpg
             .
             .
             .
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#steps-to-do-in-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Steps to do in code.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1, Imports.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D
from keras.layers import Activation, Dropout, Flatten, Dense
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;2, Initialize variables as follow&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;# image dimensions, set as per your preference.
img_width, img_height = 150, 150

train_data_dir = 'data/train'
validation_data_dir = 'data/validation'

# set the following parameters as per your preference
batch_size = 10
nb_train_samples = 800
nb_validation_samples = 200
epochs = 40
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;3, Augmentation configuration for train set&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rescale=1. / 255,
    shear_range=0.2,
    zoom_range=0.2,
    horizontal_flip=True)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;4, Augmentation configuration for test set&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;# rescaling
test_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1. / 255)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;5, Now, use the &lt;code&gt;flow_from_directory()&lt;/code&gt; method in &lt;code&gt;ImageDataGenerator&lt;/code&gt; class to generate a &lt;code&gt;tf.data.Dataset&lt;/code&gt; from image files in a directory.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(
    train_data_dir,
    target_size=(img_width, img_height),
    batch_size=batch_size,
    class_mode='binary')

validation_generator = test_datagen.flow_from_directory(
    validation_data_dir,
    target_size=(img_width, img_height),
    batch_size=batch_size,
    class_mode='binary')
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;6, Build an image classifier model, a sequential CNN architecture with relu as hidden neurons activation function and sigmoid as output neuron activation function.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;model = Sequential()
model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), input_shape=input_shape))
model.add(Activation('relu'))
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))

model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3)))
model.add(Activation('relu'))
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))

model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3)))
model.add(Activation('relu'))
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))

model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(64))
model.add(Activation('relu'))
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
model.add(Dense(1))
model.add(Activation('sigmoid'))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;7, Compile the model as follows&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy',
              optimizer='rmsprop',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;8, Now use &lt;code&gt;fit()&lt;/code&gt; method to fit your train set and validate your image dataset and calculate &lt;code&gt;steps_per_epoch &amp;amp; validation_steps&lt;/code&gt; by doing a &lt;code&gt;floor division&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;steps_per_epoch=nb_train_samples // batch_size&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;validation_steps=nb_validation_samples // batch_size&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;model.fit(
    train_generator,
    steps_per_epoch=nb_train_samples // batch_size,
    epochs=epochs,
    validation_data=validation_generator,
    validation_steps=nb_validation_samples // batch_size)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>ANSIBLE - AUTOMAÇÃO DE BACKUPS</title>
      <author>Thamayron</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 Jun 2021 00:04:29 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/thamayron/ansible-automacao-de-backups-4i17</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/thamayron/ansible-automacao-de-backups-4i17</guid>
      <description>&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sobre-ansible"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Sobre Ansible&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O Ansible é uma ferramenta de automação sem agente que gerencia hosts por meio de módulos através do protocolo SSH (por padrão). Uma vez instalado, o Ansible pode gerenciar remotamente, uma grande quantidade de máquinas, a partir de um servidor, ou seja, após instalar o Ansible, o servidor irá utilizar SSH para se comunicar com os hosts definidos em sua configuração.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ansible pode ser instalado e executado em qualquer máquina com Sistema Operacional baseado em UNIX (Red Hat, Debian, CentOS, macOS e qualquer um dos BSDs), não sendo possível utilizá-lo em Windows. É necessária a utilização do Python (Python 2 (versão 2.7) ou Python 3 (versão 3.5 e superior)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sobre-o-projeto"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Sobre o projeto&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neste post iremos utilizar o Ansible para rotinas de Backup de ativos de rede (Network Automation), podemos utilizá-lo em uma rede com equipamentos de diversas marcas e modelos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neste cenário utilizaremos:&lt;br&gt;
Host Ansible:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Máquina Windows, com WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), utilizando "Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--18611zRt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3aaeow8xv5ovsp9m97kc.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--18611zRt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3aaeow8xv5ovsp9m97kc.PNG" alt="Ubuntu"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hosts para backup:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Switch CISCO L3 (Layer 3 - Camada 3)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Switch HUAWEI L2 (Layer 2 - camada 2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Roteador MIKROTIK&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Roteador HUAWEI&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#topologia-utilizada"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Topologia Utilizada&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--55EtzZ02--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lk6xvmyib8m3uwuf66w2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--55EtzZ02--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lk6xvmyib8m3uwuf66w2.png" alt="Topologia"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#instalando-ansible"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Instalando Ansible&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Para instalar o Ansible no Ubuntu, iremos atualizar o sistema.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo apt update
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instalar Python e Ansible&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python-utils ansible -y
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Também podemos instalar através do gerenciador de pacotes do Python, o pip (como iremos trabalhar com o Python3, instalaremos e utilizaremos pip3)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python-utils  -y
$ pip3 install ansible
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obs.: durante o processo de criação e testes, tivemos um problema com a versão do Ansible. &lt;br&gt;
No ambiente Ubuntu após o início dos testes, utilizamos a versão "ansible 2.9.6" e após a conclusão, tudo funcionou corretamente.&lt;br&gt;
Posteriormente em novos testes em novas máquinas Ubuntu e CentOS, após a instalação do Ansible, a versão instalada foi a "ansible 2.9.18", e o mesmo código não estava funcionando, após diversas pesquisas, encontramos um problema de versão após o "ansible 2.9.7" para huawei (ce_config) e juniper (junos_facts e junos_config), para corrigir este problema, realizamos o downgrade da versão do ansible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Checando versão do python, pip e ansible&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ python -V ou python --version
$ python3 -V ou python3 --version
$ ansible --version
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Caso precise saber qual python ou ansible está utilizando&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ which python
$ which python3
$ which ansible
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Downgrade do ansible&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ pip install ansible==[version]
$ pip3 install ansible==[version]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Exemplo:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ pip install ansible==2.9.6
$ pip3 install ansible==2.9.6
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Após a instalação e checagem das versões, iremos então para a utilização do Ansible em Network Automation, em rotinas de Backup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Para este projeto utilizamos apenas dois arquivos: hosts (arquivo de inventário que contém os hosts e suas variáveis) e main.yml (playbook utilizado para realizar as tarefas).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#criando-local-de-trabalho"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Criando local de trabalho&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iniciando, criamos um diretório no home para o Ansible e dentro do diretório os arquivos:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Criaremos um diretório para trabalhar com o Ansible.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ mkdir ansible
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Entraremos no diretório criado.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ cd ansible
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Para checagem em qual diretório estamos.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ pwd 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Criando o arquivo hosts e o main.yml&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ touch hosts main.yml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Listamos os arquivos dentro do diretório atual&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ls
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#arquivo-hosts-do-ansible"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Arquivo - hosts do Ansible&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Primeiro iremos tratar o arquivo hosts, neste arquivo iremos declarar os hosts que serão realizados os backups de forma automática.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O arquivo hosts possui o formato INI ou YAML, neste projeto iremos utilizar o formato INI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dentro do arquivo hosts iremos trabalhar com grupos, identificados através de colchetes “[]” e com variáveis que irão diferenciar características de cada grupo (caso necessário).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[all:vars] - criamos um grupo de "variáveis globais" que serão aplicadas em todos os hosts que não possuírem variáveis definidas exclusivamente. &lt;br&gt;
Este grupo não é obrigatório, as variáveis podem ficar “soltas” no topo do arquivo, mas preferimos utilizar este formato para organizar o arquivo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As variáveis utilizadas neste grupo são:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;vars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ansible_user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;USER_HERE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Usuário&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ansible_password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;USER_PASSWORD_HERE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Senha&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ansible_become&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;yes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Permite receber privilégios de "enable"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ansible_become_password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;USER_ROOT_PASSWORD_HERE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// senha de "enable"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ansible_become_method&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;enable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// para informar ao sistema operacional o privilégio de “enable”, para checagem de opções de become: “ansible-doc -t become -l”&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ansible_port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Porta de conexão SSH aos hosts&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ansible_connection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;network_cli&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Plugin para acesso SSH aos hosts&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;gather_facts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Coletar fatos sobre o host remoto &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Os demais grupos foram criados para cada vendor/marca de equipamentos, os nomes foram escolhidos para melhor identificação e agrupamento de hosts: [hosts_cisco], [hosts_huawei],[hosts_mikrotik].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Podemos declarar os nomes dos hosts de três formas distintas, como mostradas abaixo, em nosso arquivo iremos utilizar a forma 1:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1- HOSTNAME ansible_host=HOST_IP_ADDRESS&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hosts_cisco&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;SW_CISCO_01&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ansible_host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;10.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hosts_mikrotik&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;RT_MIKROTIK_01&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ansible_host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;10.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;2- HOST_IP_ADDRESS&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hosts_huawei&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;10.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// SW_HUAWEI_01&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;3- HOSTNAME (esta opção precisamos declarar o IP e HOSTNAME no arquivo /etc/hosts)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Editando arquivo /etc/hosts (escolha seu editor vi/vim/nano/pico)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo vim /etc/hosts
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Inserindo os dados dentro do arquivo /etc/hosts&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ANSIBLE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HOSTS&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;IP_ADDRESS&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HOSTNAME&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;10.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.3&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span class="nx"&gt;RT_HUAWEI_01&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Editando o arquivo hosts Ansible (escolha seu editor vi/vim/nano/pico)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ vim hosts
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hosts_huawei&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;10.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// SW_HUAWEI_01&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;RT_HUAWEI_01&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Após informados os endereços IPs e/ou Hostnames iremos configurar as variáveis locais para cada tipo de host (caso necessário).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neste caso utilizamos apenas a "variável local" &lt;code&gt;ansible_network_os&lt;/code&gt;, que será utilizada para informar ao Ansible o SO (Sistema Operacional) do host, pois são equipamentos de marcas diferentes, neste caso utilizamos hosts Huawei, Cisco e Mikrotik.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;HUAWEI =&amp;gt; ansible_network_os=ce&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;CISCO =&amp;gt; ansible_network_os=ios&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;MIKROTIK =&amp;gt; ansible_network_os=routeros&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caso possuam usuários, senhas e portas de acesso diferentes para cada equipamento, será necessário inserir as linhas de &lt;code&gt;ansible_user&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ansible_password&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ansible_become_password&lt;/code&gt; e &lt;code&gt;ansible_port&lt;/code&gt; em cada grupo, para que possam utilizar as credenciais corretas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exemplo do arquivo hosts finalizado:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;vars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ansible_user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;admin&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ansible_password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Password123&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ansible_become_password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;RootPassword123&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ansible_port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ansible_connection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;network_cli&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ansible_become&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;yes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ansible_become_method&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;enable&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;gather_facts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hosts_cisco&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;SW_CISCO_01&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ansible_host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;10.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hosts_cisco&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;vars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ansible_network_os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ios&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hosts_huawei&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;SW_HUAWEI_01&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ansible_host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;10.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;RT_HUAWEI_01&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ansible_host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;10.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.3&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hosts_huawei&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;vars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ansible_network_os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ce&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hosts_mikrotik&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;RT_MIKROTIK_01&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ansible_host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;10.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.4&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hosts_mikrotik&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;vars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ansible_network_os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;routeros&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#play-book"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;PLAY BOOK&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O arquivo playbook do Ansible é um arquivo YAML, este tipo de arquivo é iniciado por “---" e precisa de indentação (dois espaços para cada nível) para sua configuração, assim como precisa da extensão .yml no final do nome do arquivo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Por padrão definimos um nome (&lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;) para o grupo de atividades que queremos realizar, em seguida definimos os hosts (&lt;code&gt;hosts&lt;/code&gt;) que farão parte daquele grupo de atividades, informamos para o Ansible que não queremos que ele colete fatos (&lt;code&gt;gather_facts&lt;/code&gt;) sobre o host remoto e &lt;code&gt;ignore_errors&lt;/code&gt; definimos para que caso haja algum erro o Ansible siga para a próxima tarefa, entre outras possíveis variáveis que podem ser inseridas nesta seção, em seguida iremos realizar as tarefas (tasks).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tarefas (tasks):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Nesta seção onde serão executados os módulos e enviados comandos para os hosts remotos afim de realizar diversos tipos de ações, em nosso caso, iremos utilizar os módulos de rede para cada equipamento (&lt;code&gt;ios_config&lt;/code&gt; para cisco, &lt;code&gt;ce_config&lt;/code&gt; para huawei, &lt;code&gt;routeros_command&lt;/code&gt; para mikrotik), realizaremos os backups dos hosts e salvaremos no diretório escolhido, renomeando da forma que acharmos melhor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Com o módulo de rede, seja ele &lt;code&gt;ios_config&lt;/code&gt; ou &lt;code&gt;ce_config&lt;/code&gt; podemos utilizar a função de backup (backup), sem que precisemos utilizar comandos da cli do vendor, para isso utilizamos esta função e suas opções (backup_options), neste caso apenas dir_path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#observa%C3%A7%C3%B5es-importantes-sobre-mikrotik"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  OBSERVAÇÕES IMPORTANTES SOBRE MIKROTIK
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;O Mikrotik não possui um módulo Ansible de Redes para realização dos backups, como nos outros vendors, então iremos realizar os backups executando os comandos necessários no roteador via CLI e enviando para nosso servidor, via &lt;strong&gt;FTP&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Os comandos (&lt;code&gt;commands&lt;/code&gt;) executados no Mikrotik são próprios da CLI do vendor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As variáveis &lt;code&gt;vars&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;ftp_server_var&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ftp_user_var&lt;/code&gt; e &lt;code&gt;ftp_pass_var&lt;/code&gt;) possuem os dados de autenticação do servidor &lt;code&gt;FTP&lt;/code&gt;, a variável &lt;code&gt;date&lt;/code&gt; será utilizada para renomear o arquivo salvo e a variável &lt;code&gt;caminho_arquivo&lt;/code&gt; corresponde ao caminho para o arquivo desejado.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serão realizados dois backups, o arquivo.backup e arquivo.src&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O diretório é definido através da opção dir_path, sendo este o local onde ficará salvo o arquivo no servidor e caso o diretório desejado não exista, o mesmo será criado.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O nome do arquivo por padrão tem o formato:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;HOSTNAME_config.YYYY-MM-DD@HH:MM:SS&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Para renomearmos os arquivos de backup, utilizamos as variáveis especiais do Ansible:&lt;br&gt;
inventory_hostname - coleta o hostname do host&lt;br&gt;
ansible_host - coleta o hostname e endereço IP do host&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#play-book-mainyml"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;PLAY BOOK - main.yml&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;Rotina de backup de hosts Cisco&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;hosts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;hosts_cisco&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;gather_facts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;no&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;ignore_errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;yes&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="na"&gt;tasks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;Backup host config - Cisco&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;ios_config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;backup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;yes&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;backup_options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;a href="#executando-ansible"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Executando Ansible&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neste tópico iremos executar o Ansible para que realize a rotina de backup dos hosts cadastrados.&lt;br&gt;
O comando ansible-playbook irá utilizar arquivo hosts como inventário e utilizará o arquivo main.yml como playbook.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ansible-playbook -i hosts main.yml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Caso precisemos fazer troubleshooting ao executar o comando acima, podemos utilizar &lt;code&gt;-vvv&lt;/code&gt;, para que sejam mostrados mais informações de saída.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ansible-playbook -i hosts main.yml -vvv
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="mi"&gt;59&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;23&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;bin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ansible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;playbook&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ansible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hosts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ansible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;yml&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/home/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ansible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log_ansible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>SaaS: The Twelve-Factor app methodology explained</title>
      <author>Carlos Loredo</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 20 Jun 2021 23:45:40 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/loboaveces/saas-the-twelve-factor-app-methodology-explained-3cjl</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/loboaveces/saas-the-twelve-factor-app-methodology-explained-3cjl</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Twelve-Factor App methodology is a methodology for building software-as-a-service applications. These best practices are designed to enable applications to be built with portability and resilience when deployed to the web.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--83UDMaL8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8uyn56ay1tf8dsc5o7ej.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--83UDMaL8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8uyn56ay1tf8dsc5o7ej.jpg" alt="12-factors_img"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
To understand this methodology we can divide the twelve factors into 3 key components:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xArfJeCt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mop1e47n55jgyzp5ugzm.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xArfJeCt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mop1e47n55jgyzp5ugzm.png" alt="12-factors-3-components"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Next, we'll see the best practices that you should follow for every factor to comply with what this methodology says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#code-factors"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Code Factors:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#factor-1-codebase"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Factor 1 - CodeBase:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--k1qMpU9d--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/88bat7esyojurnh3a8eu.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--k1qMpU9d--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/88bat7esyojurnh3a8eu.png" alt="codebase_img"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code must be tracked in a version control system (VCS) like Github, BitBucket, etc. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One-to-One relationship between the CodeBase and the application. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There can be multiple deploys of the application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different versions of the CodeBase can be in each deployment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#factor-5-build-release-and-run"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Factor 5 - Build, release and run:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Ul0L5ykL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nqdkfa5ujzqt3hlctzj8.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Ul0L5ykL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nqdkfa5ujzqt3hlctzj8.png" alt="build_release_run_img"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build: Transform a CodeBase into an executable unit called build.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Release: Combine build with configuration so that it's ready to run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run: Runs the application.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#factor-10-devprod-parity"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Factor 10 - Dev/Prod parity:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IgRTzYKj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4pcf5i767q74tvl8alwp.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IgRTzYKj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4pcf5i767q74tvl8alwp.png" alt="dev_prod_img"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimize differences between deployment and production environments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back-end services should be the same across environments (dev/prod)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#deploy-factors"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Deploy Factors:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#factor-2-dependencies"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Factor 2 - Dependencies:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ucqBffgk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nwo8742ttq3rbi120am5.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ucqBffgk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nwo8742ttq3rbi120am5.jpeg" alt="dependecy_img"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be aware that an app is only reliable as its least reliable dependency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be sure that code explicitly declares any dependency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#factor-3-config"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Factor 3 - Config:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--p_IxD_oP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8tivn8wk9v1yvqarq47c.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--p_IxD_oP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8tivn8wk9v1yvqarq47c.png" alt="config_img"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Config contains everything that varies between deploys such as credentials and backing services locations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configs must be kept separate from the code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Store config in environment variables.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#factor-4-backing-services"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Factor 4 - Backing services:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4YPxemg_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r94g7io1nlu15tdsocq7.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4YPxemg_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r94g7io1nlu15tdsocq7.png" alt="back_end_img"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applications should not distinguish between local and third-party back-end services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All services should be accessed by URL and credentials so that can be swapped without changing the code.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#factor-6-processes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Factor 6 - Processes:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KpGrb16t--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7hcklo53ws070o5i0srs.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KpGrb16t--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7hcklo53ws070o5i0srs.png" alt="process_img"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stateless and share nothing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backing services store persistent data since memory and filesystems are not shared across processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data is centrally stored.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#factor-7-port-binding"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Factor 7 - Port binding:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LzV24ftG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/67qg3oel4zzh9bxw1980.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LzV24ftG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/67qg3oel4zzh9bxw1980.png" alt="ports_img"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Export services by port binding. HTTP and other services are exported in this way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To bind a port usually you must declare a web server library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applications can be backing services for other applications.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#factor-9-disposability"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Factor 9 - Disposability:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--l4CVczc6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/po4etp9xuwa9543758a3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--l4CVczc6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/po4etp9xuwa9543758a3.png" alt="disposability_img"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applications should have minimal process start-time and graceful termination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quickly deploy code and configure changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easily scale applications. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#factor-11-logs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Factor 11 - Logs:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--598r2wTP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b7y490pmgjd6yljdfnyx.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--598r2wTP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b7y490pmgjd6yljdfnyx.png" alt="logs_img"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applications should not concern themselves with storing logs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applications should trend logs as event stream written to stdout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execution environment captures the stream for all apps aggregates the logs and routes logs to their destination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#operate-factors"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Operate Factors:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#factor-8-concurrency"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;

      <title>How to create a Mobile App for your Business with $0 </title>
      <author>Krowser Web Services </author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 20 Jun 2021 23:23:39 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/krowser/how-to-create-a-mobile-app-for-your-business-with-0-51nf</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/krowser/how-to-create-a-mobile-app-for-your-business-with-0-51nf</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about the business owners who want to build an app as an extension of their current brand, business, or website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1UDvN2MQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4gv3y93t0t4p9v3egji2.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1UDvN2MQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4gv3y93t0t4p9v3egji2.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What’s your budget?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The majority of businesses plan to budget between $250,000 and $500,000 over the next 12 to 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does this sound too high to you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It’s not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your location is relevant to how much it’s going to cost to develop your app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re located in North America, expect to pay roughly $150 per hour if you’re planning to hire someone to build your iOS mobile app.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RohUXauW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ogtrk1orji29v0zquu62.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RohUXauW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ogtrk1orji29v0zquu62.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So unless you’re planning to take a trip to Indonesia, it won’t be inexpensive. On average, an app will take about 7-9 months to build and cost you about $270,000. That’s an unrealistic number for some businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your company may not even be able to secure a $200,000 line of credit, never mind pay over $250,000 for an app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what’s the solution?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Follow my guide, and I’ll show you the most cost-effective ways to develop your app if you don’t have the funds to pay someone else to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#option-1-just-learn-how-to-code-everything"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Option #1: Just learn how to code everything
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some great resources online that teach you how to code for free. I’ll show you my favourite ones. Team Treehouse offers a free trial for a week to new users. So you can learn to code from your computer, anywhere with a Wi-Fi connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how their system works. They have thousands of videos to teach users the basics of coding. After you watch the videos, you’ll take quizzes to test your knowledge. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dvncYQYd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2uwfffdmgpsjs9llrrci.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dvncYQYd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2uwfffdmgpsjs9llrrci.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Then, Team Treehouse gives you the tools needed to practice coding with interactive challenges. The platform is super clean and easy to use, especially for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code Academy is another one of my favourites.&lt;br&gt;
Their platform also has interactive tools that will teach you the coding basics for your mobile application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OP4DHO2g--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lwiiyus6a0s6t1qozj4g.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OP4DHO2g--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lwiiyus6a0s6t1qozj4g.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#option-2-take-advantage-of-app-development-support-programs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Option #2: Take advantage of  App Development Support Programs
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For small business who are just interested in converting their existing website to a mobile app, they can take advantage of the "Krowser Web Services App Development Support Program" &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You just need to submit your business website link and an android app will be developed and published on the Google Play Store all for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole process typically takes 7 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Submit your website here: &lt;a href="https://forms.gle/jExGTmyvv2hgFcfF7"&gt;https://forms.gle/jExGTmyvv2hgFcfF7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating an android app for your business is much easier than it sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on your situation, you’ve got lots of options to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Javascript Functions</title>

      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#table-of-contents"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Table Of Contents
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#functions"&gt;Functions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#traditional"&gt;Traditional Function&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#arrow"&gt;Arrow Function&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#functions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Functions &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fundamental building block for Javascript programs. The most common feature in all programming languages. What exactly is a function in technical terms? a &lt;em&gt;function&lt;/em&gt; is a block of code that is defined once and can be executed or invoked numerous times. Another quick note is functions are also objects, meaning they can be manipulated by other programs too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can declare a function by using the &lt;code&gt;function&lt;/code&gt; keyword, following by a name of our liking, followed by a pair of opening and closing &lt;code&gt;parentheses&lt;/code&gt;, a space for between the &lt;code&gt;parameters&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;curly&lt;/code&gt; braces with zero or more statements inside.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  function buzz() { }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is another way of declaring functions in modern javascript, and thats with the &lt;code&gt;arrow function&lt;/code&gt;. Which actually looks like an arrow, but does have its own section that we will get too since it has limitations.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  () =&amp;gt; {}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Inside of the parentheses we can include &lt;strong&gt;identifiers&lt;/strong&gt; or in other words &lt;strong&gt;parameters&lt;/strong&gt;, these &lt;strong&gt;parameters&lt;/strong&gt; act as local variables for the body of the function. To get a value out of those variables we can simply invoke our function by including some values or in technical terms &lt;strong&gt;arguments&lt;/strong&gt;. We use these arguments to compute a value and return that value part of the invocation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a function is assigned to a property of an object, that function becomes a &lt;code&gt;method&lt;/code&gt; of that object. This is where things start to get a bit more complex since we are now invoking on or through an object, as where the object becomes the context of the &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; keyword. The &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; keyword is a while other article to discuss about so we will skip that for now, but it's something good to note down about when creating methods for objects. With that being said we are also allowed to simply assign a function to a variable and pass them to other functions. Since functions are objects like we mentioned before, you can set properties on them and invoke methods on them too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#traditional-functions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Traditional Functions &lt;a&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;function&lt;/code&gt; keyword is the only way to declare a function. We can also declare function expressions which pretty much a function stored inside a variable. For example&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Function declaration&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
function printName(str) {
   return "Hello " + str
}

console.log(printName('oscar')) // output "Hello oscar"

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Function expression&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;let addUp = function(a,b) {
  return a + b
} 

console.log(addUp(1,2)) // output 3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the major differences between a &lt;code&gt;function declaration&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;function expression&lt;/code&gt; is the &lt;em&gt;function&lt;/em&gt; name, which in function expressions can be left out to create anonymous functions. By default functions return &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; if there is no specific return statement with any value to return. One other thing to note about functions is that they can be conditionally declared too inside &lt;code&gt;if / esle&lt;/code&gt; statements, but typically has inconsistent results so it's not a very good pattern to use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cool feature that comes with &lt;em&gt;declaration functions&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;hoisting&lt;/strong&gt;, you are able to use your function before you declare it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;printHello(); // logs 'Hello'

function printHello() {
   console.log('Hello');
}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Function expressions on the other hand are &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;hoisted&lt;/strong&gt;. So you can not use your function expression before you create them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#arrow-functions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Arrow Functions &lt;a&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were introduced into &lt;code&gt;arrow functions&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;ES6&lt;/strong&gt;, it's a nice compact alternative to a traditional function expression, but has limitations and can't be used in all situations. It does not have bindings like &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;super&lt;/code&gt; keywords and not suitable for &lt;code&gt;call&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;apply&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;bind&lt;/code&gt; methods, cant be used as constructors either. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's break down a &lt;code&gt;declared function&lt;/code&gt; into a &lt;code&gt;arrow function&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  function(name) {
    return 'Hello ' + name;
  }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We start off by removing the &lt;code&gt;function&lt;/code&gt; keyword and leave the arguments, and add an &lt;code&gt;arrow&lt;/code&gt; between the arguments and curly braces.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  (name) =&amp;gt; {
  return 'Hello ' + name;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;next we will remove the curly braces and return statement. The return statement is automatically implied.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  (name) =&amp;gt; 'Hello ' + name;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;and for the last step we can remove the parantheses since we only have a single argument being passing into the parameters.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  name =&amp;gt; 'Hello ' + name;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned before, it is highly recommended that we don't use arrow functions are &lt;code&gt;methods&lt;/code&gt; to avoid bugs or any other issues, arrow functions are best for non-method functions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope by the end of this article you managed to learn how to create and understood what is going on in every line of code. It is very important to understand how your code fully works, not only does it help you become a better developer but can also help you use the tools you are working with more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These articles are mostly intended for personal use on becoming a better programmer, writer, and grow my programming skills. Feel free to drop any feedback or corrections that you believe that should be made to help me and others. Thank you for your time for sticking this far! &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cordova FCM-Push Notification</title>
      <author>Ikwegbu George</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 20 Jun 2021 22:12:47 +0000</pubDate>

&lt;p&gt;Are you a cordova developer and trying to implement the FCM push notification but encounter errors, ok, I was once like you few hours ago from writing this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I'd like to drop what I learned on how to solve this problem. Because the plugin itself has some bugs in it (At the time of writing this article).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#table-of-contents"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Table Of Contents
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#newProject"&gt;Creating new Cordova Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#platform"&gt;Adding Android Platform&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#plugin"&gt;Adding FCM plugin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#firebase"&gt;Creating new Firebase Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#config"&gt;Editing Config.xml file&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#file"&gt;Adding the google-services.json File&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#bug"&gt;Correcting Plugin Bugs in Files&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#fun"&gt;Running getToken Function inside Device Ready&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-new-cordova-project"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating new Cordova Project &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Navigate to the Folder you want to keep this project in.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;C:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;georgeikwegbu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;usser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Documents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;GitHub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;_sideProjects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then create a new folder (directory) either from the GUI or&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;mkdir&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cordovaFcm&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// this creates a new folder with name cordovaFcm&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cordovaFcm&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// this changes the current working directory to the newly created one.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, create a cordova app within the new directory&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cordova&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;create&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// This creates a boilerplate of the cordova app within the current  &lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// project because of the period (.) we added.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#adding-android-platform"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Adding Android Platform &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have created the new cordova app, the next thing to do &lt;br&gt;
is to add a platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;I currently do not own a macbook (😪), so my article will be 
based on the android platform. (I'm really sorry 😥)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cordova&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;platform&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;android&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// this adds the android platform to the project&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

just kidding,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ok, hope you are already familiar with Firebase, as we won't explain much about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to firebase: &lt;a href="https://firebase.google.com/"&gt;https://firebase.google.com/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an account if you don't have any, or go to console if you have and logged into it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on 'Add Project'&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter the project name, most suitable will be the actual project name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accept the next slide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose or create a new account (I went with the default account).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scroll down (on the side navigation bar, to the (at the time of writing this article) Engage section, and select the cloud messaging).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the android icon, and continue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The next slide, will ask you to enter the android package name, this name must rhyme with the ID or Package name your have in you config.xml file (If you can, read the next section about config.xml).
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;widget&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;com.fcmpushnotification.georgeikwegbu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;1.0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;xmlns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;http://www.w3.org/ns/widgets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;xmlns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cdv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;http://cordova.apache.org/ns/1.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;It will be in reverse domain name eg. 'mrbrowny.dev.to' will be 
'to.dev.mrbrowny'

And the 'App nickname', will be the value you have in your 'name 
tag' within your config.xml file.

Please leave the 'Debug signing certificate SHA-1 (optional)' 
empty, as it's beyond this article, then click on the 'Register 
app'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After clicking on the 'Register app', the accordion, will bring out your 'google-services.json' for your app, download it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#editing-configxml-file"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Editing Config.xml file &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing much to do here, as you should know what and how you wish your app to look and work. But, key things to take into considerations are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Package name, which is what you will provide on the firebase console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name of the project, which is found within the 'name' tag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The description is left for you to decide what that will be 😉.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#adding-the-googleservicesjson-file"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Adding the google-services.json File &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--drnXFEMR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h7i96w8h1bhi5f6orqyq.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--drnXFEMR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h7i96w8h1bhi5f6orqyq.PNG" alt="google-services json file"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The google-services.json file you downloaded, is to be added to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The root of the cordova project
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;georgeikwegbu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;usser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Documents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;GitHub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_sideProjects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cordova_fcm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 'platform\android\app\' of the platform
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;georgeikwegbu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;usser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Documents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;GitHub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_sideProjects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cordova_fcm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;platforms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;android&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be leaving the link to the github repo of the plugin itself, but all codes should be run after the device ready, so place it within the onDeviceReady function:&lt;br&gt;
