If so, it would be the first electrified vehicle to win the gruelling competition.</p><p>&nbsp;The RS Q E-Tron relies on an electric drivetrain with two modified Formula E motors, one at each axle. As you won&#39;t find a charging station in the middle of the desert, however, Audi uses a race-ready TFSI engine as part of an energy converter that charges the battery while driving and braking. This isn&#39;t a zero-emissions car, then, but it stays in a relatively efficient power band (between 4,500RPM and 6,000RPM) that should reduce the racer&#39;s environmental impact.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The machine should be highly adaptable, too. Unlike many EVs, the front and rear axles aren&#39;t mechanically connected — software handles torque distribution instead. That not only allows for an easily reconfigurable center differential, but saves the bulk that would normally be used for a conventional differential and propshaft.</p><p>Audi plans to enter the machine into multiple cross-country rallies in 2021 before participating in the Dakar Rally in January.</p><p>If Audi is successful, the RS Q E-Tron will make a stronger case for eco-friendly endurance racing. While not a pure EV, it will handle extremely long stages (up to 500 miles) with a significantly reduced emissions footprint. It also won&#39;t surprise you to hear that Audi wants more than just bragging rights. It expects lessons learned from the car to reach production cars. We wouldn&#39;t count on something with a similar drivetrain when the VW group is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vw-ev-sales-2030-target-153212862.html">transitioning to EVs</a>, but it&#39;s easy to imagine <a href="https://www.engadget.com/preview-2020-01-15-audi-etron-review.html">electric SUVs</a> and crossovers that are better-suited to off-roading.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/audi-rs-q-e-tron-2022-dakar-rally-163605282.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f4997ee3-e262-4b19-80b8-ae067a9582eb</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jul 2021 16:36:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627144567</ingested><modified>2021-07-24T16:36:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d3082cf0-ec96-11eb-affe-66001e6b7813" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d3082cf0-ec96-11eb-affe-66001e6b7813" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Audi]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Audi RS Q e-tron]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Audi RS Q e-tron]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hitting the Books: Digital youth activism can help save America from itself]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Social media routinely proves itself a cesspool of racist, bigoted and toxic opinions — and that&#39;s just coming from the adults.

I think deep down we all believe this and want it to be true. But there are many elements of our society that are set up to communicate the opposite message. Much of school is designed in a way that tells our kids that they are to apply the skills they are learning some day in their hypothetical future, not now. They are taught to learn math because they will need it to get into college. They are taught to write because it will be an important skill when they get a job. In history, the people they learn about are always adults, not kids. They have little choice or control over the learning experience itself; they are handed a schedule, given assignments (that they didn’t have any input in designing), and told to complete by a date that they didn’t choose. The message that young voices don’t matter is reinforced by the fact that they can’t vote until they are eighteen. One of the most important tenets of democracy is the idea that everyone has a voice. We teach that to our children, yet we offer very few ways to actually use that voice before they’re no longer kids. Fortunately, the digital world gives a wide set of tools that can help change that narrative. These tools allow youth to have a voice and learn how to make a meaningful impact on their community, family, and in some cases, the world as a whole—right now, not decades down the road.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Just Some Students from Florida</em></p><p>In February 2018, Marjory Stoneman High School in Parkland, Florida, was in the news worldwide when nineteen-year-old Nikolas Cruz entered the school with a semiautomatic rifle, killing seventeen people and injuring seventeen others. This horrific event became one of the deadliest school shootings in US history. Yet there was a unique ending to this tragic story that set it apart for another reason. In other school shootings, traditional news media and political leaders quickly shape the national conversation around the event. A narrative emerges around what actually happened, with speculation about the causes, who is to blame, and the political responses to justify action (or lack thereof). But in the case of Parkland, it was the students who shaped the national conversation. Frustrated about viewpoints and conclusions from adults that they did not share or agree with, they used their access to social media to reset and redirect the conversation into what has now become one of the most powerful examples of youth engagement ever seen. Within a week of the shooting, the students had appeared on nearly every major news program and had raised more than $3 million in donations to support their cause. Emma Gonzáles, one of the most recognizable faces of the movement, has over 1.5 million Twitter followers—about twice as many as the National Rifle Association.&nbsp;</p><p>Not long after the shooting, I met Diane Wolk-Rogers, a history teacher at Stoneman High School. As she explained, nobody could have prepared these students for the horror they faced on that day. But they had been prepared to know how to use technology to make their voices heard. Wolk-Rogers says, “They are armed with incredible communication skills and a sense of citizenship that I find so inspiring.” So when it was time to act, they knew the tools of the trade.&nbsp;</p><p>Engaged digital citizens know how to use technology to identify and propose solutions and promote action around causes that are important to them and their communities. Micro-activism is a term used to describe small-scale efforts that, when combined, can bring about significant change. While young people might not be able to vote or run for office, they have a whole range of micro-activism opportunities—all made possible by their participation in the digital world. For youth who have access to social media, micro-activism can be as simple as using their digital platforms to call awareness to issues that matter to them—eradicating racism, protecting our planet, or funding their school, and so on. Most states have a function on their website to submit ideas or feedback directly to the office of the governor. Through sites like Change.org anyone, regardless of age, can submit suggestions to political leaders or private sector entities. You can also add your name in support of other petitions that are gaining momentum. There are many compelling stories of youth who have used Change.org to call attention to issues that matter to them. Examples include a ten-year-old who used the platform to convince Jamba Juice to switch from Styrofoam cups to a more environmentally friendly alternative. Or a seventh grader who used Change.org to successfully petition the Motion Picture Association to change the rating on a movie about school bullying so students in her junior high would be allowed to see it.</p><p>Not all acts of micro-activism will immediately result in a desired change. But regardless of the outcome, learning how to impact community issues using digital tools is an important skill to develop in and of itself. The ability to motivate others to act for good in a virtual space will be a significant (if not the significant) determining factor in the effectiveness of future civic leaders. Young people need to practice using tech to make a difference now, if they are going to be prepared to lead our society when they grow up.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-digital-for-good-richard-culatta-harvard-business-press-153034423.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cf227f78-6942-4b20-9367-e9796d552720</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jul 2021 15:30:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626721806</ingested><modified>2021-07-19T19:10:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Career & Education]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-04/a3538f80-7f38-11ea-92b6-9f9d6ac036d8" width="3500" height="2359" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-04/a3538f80-7f38-11ea-92b6-9f9d6ac036d8" width="3500" height="2359" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jonathan Ernst / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Emma Gonzalez, a student and shooting survivor from the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, cries as she addresses the conclusion of the "March for Our Lives" event demanding gun control after recent school shootings at a rally in Washington, U.S., March 24, 2018.

The always-on display is still very helpful, and on Series 6 is brighter to help you see it during outdoor expeditions. It&#39;s slightly faster, lasts slightly longer on battery and charges quickly.  We&#39;d add that the Apple Watch remains the go-to wristwear for iPhone users between the tight integration, deep app ecosystem and wide range of bands and accessories.</p><p>Timing is the main concern at this point. It&#39;s no secret that the Series 6 is nearly a year old, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-leak-and-body-temperature-132421478.html">Series 7</a> is likely just a couple of months away. If money isn&#39;t your main concern, it might be worth waiting for the updated hardware. With that said, the Series 7 likely won&#39;t see discounts like this for a long while — the Series 6 is still a good value if you either can&#39;t afford to wait or just want a full-featured Apple Watch at the lowest possible price.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-6-product-red-amazon-sale-151433869.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d9969c6e-0305-4c74-a3f3-9748a64b27bc</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jul 2021 15:14:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627139676</ingested><modified>2021-07-24T15:14:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c55fd260-ec8c-11eb-b7af-fcf1d94f9d2c" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c55fd260-ec8c-11eb-b7af-fcf1d94f9d2c" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple Watch Series 6 Product Red with Count Up face]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Watch Series 6 Product Red with Count Up face]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Engadget Podcast: Is the Valve Steam Deck a Switch killer?]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week on the show, Devindra and Engadget Buyer’s Guide Editor Kris Naudus chat about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-181222143.html">Valve’s new Steam Deck</a> portable with <a href="https://twitter.com/JordanWMinor?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Jordan Minor</a>, <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/authors/jordan-minor">Apps and Games Analyst at PCMag</a>.

The show is set in Los Angeles in the year 2032, putting its events in between the original Harrison Ford movie set in 2019 and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-20-designing-the-technology-of-blade-runner-2049.html">sequel film</a> starring Ryan Gosling set in 2049. It features a new replicant named Elle known as the &quot;Black Lotus,&quot; who was created with special powers. She seems to have escaped from her creators, and is currently being hunted down by authorities.</p><p>In the action-packed trailer, you&#39;ll see Elle take down foe after foe — she goes from not knowing how she&#39;s able to knock a handful of men completely out cold to wielding a katana — in a backdrop of smoke, fog and neon lights. Elle is voiced by Jessica Henwick (<em>Iron Fist</em>) in the English version and Arisa Shida in the Japanese version. The show will run for 13 episodes, which will be directed by Shinji Aramaki (<em>Ultraman</em>, <em>Ghost in the Shell: SAC 2045</em>) and Kenji Kamiyama (<em>Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, SAC_2045</em>).

The agency has been planning to send a probe to the Jovian moon for years and finalized its plans in 2019. In its <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-awards-launch-services-contract-for-europa-clipper-mission">announcement</a>, NASA said the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-20-nasa-confirms-europa-mission.html">Europa Clipper</a> spacecraft is scheduled to launch in October 2024 on top of a Falcon Heavy rocket from Kennedy Space Center&#39;s Launch Complex 39A. It has also revealed that the contract will cost the agency approximately $178 million — a bargain, compared to what it would&#39;ve cost to launch the mission on top of NASA&#39;s Space Launch System rocket.</p><p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/07/spacex-to-launch-the-europa-clipper-mission-for-a-bargain-price/"><em>Ars Technica</em></a> notes, Congress originally urged NASA to use the SLS to launch the Europa Clipper. At the time, though, the White House <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/11/the-white-house-puts-a-price-on-the-sls-rocket-and-its-a-lot/">estimated</a> a single SLS launch to cost a whopping $2 billion. Far from ideal, especially since the SLS would need gravity assist from Venus and travel farther to be able to reach its goal, whereas the Falcon Heavy wouldn&#39;t. In addition, NASA told Ars that the SLS would need $1 billion worth of additional modifications to be able to complete the mission.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If Europa Clipper launches in October 2024 as planned, it will reach Jupiter&#39;s orbit in April 2030. The probe will then investigate whether the icy moon truly has conditions suitable for life. It&#39;ll capture &quot;high-resolution images of Europa&#39;s surface, determine its composition, look for signs of recent or ongoing geological activity, measure the thickness of the moon&#39;s icy shell, search for subsurface lakes, and determine the depth and salinity of Europa&#39;s ocean.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/spacex-europa-clipper-mission-jupiters-040804303.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9f30abd6-acff-437c-b961-333898c87d25</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jul 2021 04:08:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627099752</ingested><modified>2021-07-24T04:09:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/16ef02c0-ec30-11eb-bdf7-5cb0d5a8dd26" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/16ef02c0-ec30-11eb-bdf7-5cb0d5a8dd26" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NASA/JPL-Caltech]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Europa Clipper]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Europa Clipper]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Relaxing behind the wheel of Mercedes’ level 3 autonomous Drive Pilot]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="fa52da2fee39442e9e91117e63beb39f"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5TWKFHsvseo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>The dream of autonomous driving everywhere is still a long way away. But soon Mercedes will launch Drive Pilot, its level 3 autonomous driving system in Germany on the S-Class and EQS. We had a chance to try the system out at the automaker’s test track and, while it did what it was supposed to do, we found it hard to turn off our driving brain while behind the wheel.</p><p>The system works on highways in traffic at speeds up to 60 kph (37 mph). Essentially it’s for daily commuting. But during that time the driver can stop paying attention and the Mercedes is responsible for everything that happens. That’s not to say you can nap, the vehicle still tracks the driver with an in-car monitor and it requires the driver to take over when it’s about to go faster than 37 mph, an emergency vehicle shows up, it rains or other situations that the vehicle is not built to handle. But you can play Tetris and text people. So that’s fun.

The EQS will land in dealers this fall at a yet-to-be-announced price point and, when it does, it’ll take on offerings from Tesla and Porsche. How will it fare against these EVs? We had a chance to drive the 2021 EQS for two days and figure out how it stacks up not just against competitors but up against the S-Class itself.</p><p>On our drive we got time behind the 450+ with rear-wheel drive, the 580 4Matic with all-wheel drive, and the Edition One version with its two-tone paint and 580 4Matic powerplant. All vehicles have a 107.8 kWh capacity battery pack and on the WLTP range test, the vehicle is rated at 485 miles. Of course, the more stringent EPA testing needs to be done and that number should fall. For now, we have a drive and impressions while we wait for range estimates and pricing.

Following a <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/commercialcrew/2021/07/22/flight-readiness-concludes-for-boeings-orbital-flight-test-2/">flight readiness review</a>, NASA is moving forward with the craft’s upcoming July 30th uncrewed orbital flight test. Unless there’s an unforeseen delay, the capsule will launch from the Space Force’s Cape Canaveral Station mounted on an Atlas V rocket at 2:53PM ET. Should NASA postpone the flight, it will again attempt to carry out the test on August 3rd at the earliest.</p><p>The purpose of the flight is for NASA to conduct an end-to-end test of Starliner’s capabilities. It wants to know if the capsule can handle every aspect of a trip to the ISS, including launch, docking as well as atmospheric re-entry. “[Orbital Flight Test-2] will provide valuable data that will help NASA certify Boeing’s crew transportation system to carry astronauts to and from the space station,” the agency said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If the flight is a success, NASA will move forward with a crewed test of the Starliner. Steve Stich, commercial crew program manager at NASA, said that could happen “as soon as later this year.” Both Boeing and NASA have a lot invested in the viability of Starliner.

But one of the most unique things about it is definitely the patching matrix. It&#39;s a digital reimagining of the pin-based patching system found on classic the classic <a href="https://www.engadget.com/soulwax-ems-synthi-100-deewee-sessions-143007711.html">EMS Synthi</a>. People were apparently so enamored with the matrix that the company is now offering it as a standalone product called the Matrix Mixer.</p><p>As you&#39;d expect the Matrix Mixer is, a mixer. It has 16 3.5mm ins and 16 3.5mm outs along the X and Y axes which you can use to combine either audio or control voltage signals.  The actual interface for combining them is the same as the SYNTRX: a 16x16 grid of LEDs that you navigate using a pair of knobs just like you were drawing on an Etch A Sketch. Pressing down on the encoders enables a connection, and then you can cycle through different levels of attenuation, from 100-, to 70- and then 30-percent.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This makes it quick and easy to connect a bunch of different modules and synths without a rats nest of cables. You can even connect multiple sources or destination to the same patch point without special stacking cables.</p><p>Before this desktop version of the Matrix Mixer, and even before the SYNTRX, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/erica-synths-pico-system-iii-modular-synthesizer-review-130001111.html">Erica Synths</a> made a Eurorack Module called the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo_KviHAyh8">Matrix Mixer</a>. The core idea was the same, but it had less inputs and outputs, relied on a tiny touchscreen for controls and was limited to Eurorack connections. This new version easily integrates other sources like a guitar or synthesizer using the 1/4-inch in and outs on the back. You can even patch a Buchla Music Easel in using special adapter cards.</p><p>The Matrix Mixer can even store presets, allowing you to quickly recall particular patches, though you will have to manually set all the parameters on your modules.&nbsp;</p><p>Erica Synths has brought one of the best features of the SYNTRX to a wider audience and expanded it flexibility. But, it doesn&#39;t come cheap. It&#39;s currently available for preorder for €490 or $599 and is expected to star shipping on July 26.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/erica-synths-syntrx-matrix-mixer-modular-synth-setup-170346218.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f1863eec-ff2e-4075-806b-5d1b3d9e7883</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2021 17:03:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627061031</ingested><modified>2021-07-23T17:24:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/6e8583d0-ebd4-11eb-87fb-4c36d4fca0dd" width="2048" height="1365" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/6e8583d0-ebd4-11eb-87fb-4c36d4fca0dd" width="2048" height="1365" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Andrey Nikiforov]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Erica Synths Matrix Mixer]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Erica Synths Matrix Mixer]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook’s cloud gaming service hits iOS devices as a web app]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Facebook has become the latest company to offer a cloud gaming service on iOS, only once again you won&#39;t access it through the App Store. Starting today, you can visit the <a href="http://www.fb.gg/play">Facebook Gaming website</a> to add a Progressive Web App (PWA) that acts as a shortcut to the service on your iPhone or iPad. To do so, visit the platform&#39;s website and tap the &quot;Add to Home Screen&quot; option from the Safari share sheet.</p><p>It&#39;s not an elegant solution, but it&#39;s the same one employed by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/luna-amazon-cloud-gaming-interview-pwa-apple-173948922.html">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-could-gaming-ios-web-215045999.html">Microsoft</a>. When Apple tweaked its guidelines last September to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-app-store-google-stadia-xcloud-microsoft-171436934.html">allow for cloud gaming clients</a> on iOS, it said games offered in a streaming service had to be individually downloaded from the App Store. That&#39;s a requirement both Microsoft and Facebook said was not congruent with how every other platform treats cloud gaming services.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;We&#39;ve come to the same conclusion as others: web apps are the only option for streaming cloud games on iOS at the moment,&quot; Vivek Sharma, Facebook&#39;s vice-president of gaming, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22589398/facebook-cloud-gaming-web-app-launch-apple">told <em>The Verge</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>of today&#39;s launch. &quot;As many have pointed out, Apple&#39;s policy to &#39;allow&#39; cloud games on the App Store doesn&#39;t allow for much at all. Apple&#39;s requirement for each cloud game to have its own page, go through review and appear in search listings defeats the purpose of cloud gaming.&quot;</p><p>The process of adding the web app is complicated enough that Facebook includes a short how-to when you first visit its Gaming website on Safari. You also have to know to navigate to the company&#39;s website in the first place. The reason for that is the App Store guidelines prohibit developers from using their applications to direct individuals to websites that feature alternative payment systems to those offered by Apple, and you pay for the in-game purchases offered in Facebook Gaming titles through Facebook&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-pay-online-stores-121041167.html">Pay platform</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-gaming-ios-pwa-163440977.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">46ded07f-7842-464e-b1fb-c01933b6715a</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2021 16:34:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627073258</ingested><modified>2021-07-23T20:47:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0443ef80-ebd3-11eb-9df4-6ff4fb476f16" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0443ef80-ebd3-11eb-9df4-6ff4fb476f16" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Igor Bonifacic / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook Gaming]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Facebook Gaming]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Eargo's in-app test transforms its next-gen hearing aids]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Eargo recently announced its latest smart hearing aid — the Eargo 5. We don’t do a <em>lot</em> of hearing aid news here at Engadget, but the California-based company makes some of the most &quot;gadgety&quot; we’ve tried and the latest model certainly appears to continue that trend.</p><p>Like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-09-eargo-neo-hifi-hands-on.html">Neo HiFi</a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-10-eargo-neo-hearing-aid-hands-on.html">Neo </a>before it, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Eargo 5" href="https://fave.co/2V5Egcq">Eargo 5</a> is a tiny, &quot;invisible&quot; (completely in the canal, or CIC) hearing aid that comes with a charging case. With older Eargos, that case doubled as a way to connect the “buds” to your phone. Unfortunately, that meant the buds had to be in it while they were updated. What’s new this time around is that you can perform profile changes and more while actually wearing the hearing aids. What&#39;s more, there are key new features that change how the hearing aids <em>sound</em>. It’s an exciting update for fans of the brand as it adds to Eargo’s already slick user experience, something sorely lacking in many of the mainstream brands you find at your local audiologists.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The most interesting new feature is “Sound Match.&quot; Hearing aids have long had different profiles, and will usually be tuned for your own needs by an audiologist, but Eargo’s direct-to-consumer (and the need for the buds to be in the case) approach has made this much-needed personalization difficult. Until now?</p><p>Sound Match is effectively a hearing test built-in to the Eargo app. Once you pair the case (via Bluetooth) you can remove the Eargo 5s and the app will walk you through the test. If you’ve ever completed a hearing test, you’ll be familiar with this one. The app plays a series of sounds and you tell it if you can hear it or not; at the end, you’ll be presented with the results for each ear.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b518a170-eb0b-11eb-be67-3523bdbfb58f" alt="Eargo 5." data-uuid="cef96560-4a66-3d0a-adbb-6a89bf1eb1b4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>As simple as this is, my initial experiences with it weren’t entirely smooth. Not least because it took a few tries (and some back and forth with Eargo) to even get the case to pair with the app. After trying several restarts and installations, I was able to get connected and access the test — most likely due to me having early hardware.</p><p>From then on the test was mostly straightforward, until I spotted there was a “replay” button. I noticed that sometimes when I didn’t initially hear a sound, I definitely heard it after tapping replay. As in, it was audible enough that I wouldn’t have missed it the first time around. This meant I had to re-do the test to make sure I hadn’t incorrectly tapped “No” when really the sound just didn’t play at all.</p><p>Minor hiccups aside, once I was confident I had completed the test properly, I could further customize the experience by changing what profiles are available on the device. There are six situational ones (restaurant/meeting etc) and four presets. You can store a total of four on the hearing aids themselves.</p><p>Previous Eargo models would simply tell you the number of the audio profile that is active as you switch through the four on offer (via a double-tap on your tragus). With the Eargo 5 it now tells you the name of that profile if you chose one of the &quot;situational&quot; ones to eliminate any guesswork. You can also further tweak these profiles in the app, or simply change the volume and noise reduction (there’s now noise reduction here too I should mention) without having to permanently change the profile. This includes adjusting the volume and the treble/bass.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b4e5e060-eb05-11eb-ad8e-d7212eb07c0f" alt="Eargo 5 smart hearing aid." data-uuid="dd2cb7e0-8d88-3664-b4a9-48cfa8511673"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Although you can now adjust the sound and profiles while actually wearing the Eargo (before, you had to take them out and plop them in the case, which is less than ideal), there’s no capability for music/audio streaming from your phone. Eargo uses ultrasonic commands to communicate between the case and the hearing aids. That’s a neat way to enable small updates, but not enough for anything more heavyweight. Remember, size is key here, and streaming on devices this small, that go fully in your ear, isn’t a simple thing to do.</p><p>This new customization functionality really does improve the Eargo experience. I have tried several different devices and the ones that best serve my hearing loss are, predictably, the ones that have been tuned by an audiologist. This meant that, while older Eargos were some of the most appealing in terms of user experience and fit, they weren’t quite suitable for my personal situation and only provided users with limited tools to adjust the sound to their needs.</p><p>With the Eargo 5, I find them much more assistive in my hearing, particularly on the side I have problems with. In fact, I personally prefer just wearing only one, as my hearing loss is unilateral and having a boost on the &quot;good&quot; side can feel a bit much. I also find wearing both a bit less comfortable. There’s no logical reason why wearing one for extended periods should be fine, but two isn’t, but I think the combination of too much &quot;extra&quot; hearing (on my good side) and the physical feeling of something in both ears is just a lot of sensory stimulation, for me at least. Obviously, if you have a bilateral hearing deficiency you’ll want all the assistance you can get.</p><p>If you own a pair of older Eargos and were wondering if the hearing test feature might come to your model via an update, sadly it&#39;s not possible. There&#39;s specific hardware here to enable the ultrasonic commands, that isn&#39;t present in previous models.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/272cadb0-eb07-11eb-84ed-91ec0e3caa0b" alt="Eargo 5 smart hearing aid." data-uuid="2e19d548-89d0-33db-af09-3b8285a6599b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Beyond Sound Match, Eargo claims the sound has been redesigned from the ground up for “optimal audio and speech performance.” The company doesn’t elaborate further but, with the new customization feature, it’s fair to say this is a very different experience than previous models already so any other improvements are hard to pick out, but good to know they are there.</p><p>Beyond the core updates, there are some welcome usability tweaks, too. The charging case now has lights around where the hearing aids should be placed to help you correctly seat them at night. Those lights also provide feedback by changing color when there’s a software update or the aids aren’t charging properly. You’ll also no longer need to make sure the contacts on the buds meet the ones in the case. A new magnetic inductive charging system means they will click themselves into the right position automatically.</p><p>While Eargo&#39;s app remains a slick experience, there are a few small opportunities to improve it further. The volume control is nice and simple, and you can choose to boost either side individually, or both as a pair. What’s lacking is visual feedback or even a tone in your ear, to let you know when you’ve reached the top or bottom of the range. There’s also no indication of whether any changes you make to a profile are permanently saved or an obvious way to reset them to default, but these are minor UI issues.</p><p>Battery life is claimed to be around 16 hours per charge. Add to that the battery in the case and this means you won’t need to plug them in for a couple of days, which is handy for weekends away where you don’t want to have to worry about finding an outlet. Should you need to, though, the charger is USB-C, so likely something you already have for your phone or laptop (a cable is, of course, included).</p><p>All in all, it&#39;s a substantial update for a direct-to-consumer product. Eargo has been getting a lot of things right in terms of making its products user-friendly and appealing to a mass audience. This matters when it&#39;s estimated that<a href="https://www.hearingloss.org/wp-content/uploads/HLAA_HearingLoss_Facts_Statistics.pdf?pdf=FactStats"> over 40 million Americans</a> could benefit from an assistive hearing device. What was lacking, until now that is, was a way to tune them to your specific needs. Which in the world of hearing loss, can be the difference between understanding the television a bit better and being able to pick out quieter sounds in a noisy environment. The latter is something that makes daily life feel a lot more natural and makes social situations much more comfortable, so it&#39;s something really valuable to have on a device this small.</p><p>Remember, though, hearing aids are not a cheap product category. A good pair will often run you a couple of thousand dollars, more if you want something bespoke. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Eargo 5" href="https://fave.co/2V5Egcq">Eargo 5</a>, then, at $2,950 might seem steep compared to a pair of wireless headphones but is relatively affordable among its hearing aid peers. If you’re already an Eargo user looking to upgrade, there’s a “repeat customer discount” that can shave off $500 from the MSRP.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/eargos-latest-smart-hearing-aids-bring-a-much-needed-hearing-test-160001810.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">589bab0f-6bfb-4b7a-aafa-55c0b4a479d0</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2021 16:00:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627058052</ingested><modified>2021-07-23T16:34:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/57a480c0-eb03-11eb-afdf-aba7829f60e1" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/57a480c0-eb03-11eb-afdf-aba7829f60e1" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[James Trew / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Eargo 5 smart hearing aid.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Eargo 5 smart hearing aid]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[This week's best deals: $100 off Apple's iPad Air and more]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A bunch of gadgets went on sale this week, from Apple products to streaming devices.

The company says it plans to replace defective batteries, but until it can do so it&#39;s advising Bolt customers to limit their charging up to 90 percent, and not to go below 70 miles of range. It&#39;s also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-chevy-bolt-fire-warning-215322969.html">reiterating a recommendation from last week</a> against parking indoors and leaving the car&#39;s to charge overnight unattended. This latest recall follows a similar one from last November, where <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-recalls-chevy-bolt-over-battery-fire-reports-230044311.html">GM recalled more than 68,000 Bolts</a>.</p><p>The company also suggests that Bolt customers visit their nearest Chevy EV dealer to get the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-chevy-bolt-battery-recall-software-195939173.html">advanced diagnostics software</a>, which should alert them ahead of any future battery issues.

Still, EV makers need to prove they can responsibly deal with potential issues before they can hurt more people (and before it leads to more negative sentiment towards electric vehicles).</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/gm-recalls-bolt-evs-once-again-over-fire-risks-154033780.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2d718943-6052-4672-95a4-0771704696dd</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2021 15:40:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627054836</ingested><modified>2021-07-23T15:40:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ea7bc340-ebcb-11eb-bded-1a3c921b2fa8" width="1400" height="800" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ea7bc340-ebcb-11eb-bded-1a3c921b2fa8" width="1400" height="800" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[GM recalls Bolt EVs once again over fire risks]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to clean and organize your PC]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Outside of your phone, your PC is likely the one piece of technology you use the most. If for no other reason than that, you should take care of it. Not only will it last for longer, but it will also work better over the time that you keep it. In this how-to, we&#39;ll share some tips on how to take care of your PC. Of course, it&#39;s impossible to cover this topic from every angle, so think of this guide as an introduction more than anything else.</p><h2>How to clean your computer and peripherals</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/8e767410-e8be-11eb-9fda-568912cc3572" alt="Back to School cleaning products" data-uuid="a3522e82-6274-3e1d-9c04-8910539a0b32"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget</div></figure><p>Windows PCs, especially desktops, come in various shapes and sizes, but the tips we&#39;re about to go through here will help you clean your computer whether you bought it prebuilt or put together yourself. If you own a laptop, look at our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-clean-your-mac-macbook-cleaning-supplies-digital-organization-153007592.html">recent Mac organization guide</a>. All the steps we detail there will work just as well for a Windows portable.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Before cleaning the inside of your computer, start with your display and peripherals. At this stage, all you&#39;ll need is some distilled water in a spray bottle and a microfiber cloth. You can buy the former at a grocery store or <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Make-Distilled-Water">make it yourself</a>. And if you don&#39;t already own any microfiber cloths, Amazon sells <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:affordable 24-packs" href="https://amzn.to/2UPa6dg">affordable 24-packs</a> you can get for about $15. Once you have those in hand, spray the water onto a clean cloth and wipe down your computer&#39;s display before moving to the mouse and keyboard. You want to start with your screen to avoid transferring dirt and residue to the panel.</p><p>It’s possible to write an entirely separate guide on how to clean keyboards, but the short version is you&#39;ll want to pick up a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:keycap puller" href="https://amzn.to/3ybkVot">keycap puller</a> and use that to give you unobstructed access to any debris and gunk that has been building up under your keys. If the keycaps have a lot of dirt and residue on them, your best option is to soak them in warm water and use a toothbrush to scrub away the buildup. Give them plenty of time to dry before reinstalling them on your keyboard.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/8e74c660-e8be-11eb-97ff-7defcb2a8b1e" alt="Back to School cleaning products" data-uuid="b898c8c3-89fd-3894-9b89-40f4fb907dba"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget</div></figure><p>Once you’re done with those, turn off your PC and unplug everything that&#39;s connected to it. You&#39;ll also want to switch off the power supply unit (PSU) by flipping the toggle on its outside to the &quot;O&quot; position. Next, push down on the power button a couple of times to discharge any static electricity that you might be carrying around.</p><p>If at all possible, do most of the steps we&#39;re about to describe outside. The last thing you want to do is go through the trouble of cleaning your computer and then let it pull in all that dust again.</p><p>Once you&#39;ve moved your computer, start by removing the side panels. Most modern cases allow you to do this without any tools, but you&#39;ll need at least one screwdriver for most of the work we&#39;ll detail in a moment. When it comes to most screws inside your computer, a 4-inch Phillips screwdriver should be all you need. Some components, such as your GPU, may include Torx screws and the like, but don&#39;t worry about those for now since we won&#39;t be taking them apart. If you don&#39;t already own a decent set of screwdrivers and have something of a DIY streak in you, a driver kit from iFixit is your best bet. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:16" href="https://amzn.to/3ybkTgl">16</a>, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:32" href="https://amzn.to/3h3REWK">32</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:62-bit kits" href="https://amzn.to/3jrd4Pu">62-bit kits</a> it sells are an excellent starting point, and they&#39;ll come in handy with more than just your computer.</p><p>If your PC has any dust filters, remove those now and give them a rinse at the sink before setting them aside to dry. Depending on how long your computer has been collecting dust, you may want to remove some components such as the GPU to make it easier to clean everything. If that&#39;s something you feel comfortable doing and it&#39;s your first time removing any of the internals, use your phone to take photos of the interior. The images will help you put all the parts in their original place at the end. That&#39;s important to do since there&#39;s an optimal way to install many of the components in your computer. For instance, you always want to install your GPU in the fastest available PCIe lane. When it comes to removing any PCI cards, first unscrew its mounting bracket and then push the corresponding release on your motherboard before pulling the card out.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/8e751480-e8be-11eb-a6fb-18fd90064826" alt="Back to School cleaning products" data-uuid="ac3dc9f8-b9c6-3b8a-9291-c0b88ca4b4ca"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget</div></figure><p>Whether you decide to keep all your computer&#39;s internals in place or not, you&#39;ll need something to blow all that dust away. A can of compressed air is one option, but I like to use a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Giottos Rocket Blower" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000L9OIQC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=giftguide2021-20&amp;language=en_US">Giottos Rocket Blower</a>. It was designed for cleaning camera sensors and won&#39;t damage any of your components. It&#39;s also a one-time purchase. Whatever you have at hand, use it to blow away the dust that&#39;s been building up on your computer&#39;s internal components, fans and grills. Pay special attention to the heatsinks attached to your PC’s CPU, GPU, chipset and voltage regulators. They will likely have most of the hardest to remove dust in your system thanks to their tight fin stacks. What’s more, especially bad buildup can make them ineffective at cooling those components, which will, in turn, affect their performance.</p><p>When cleaning any exposed PCB, use an antistatic brush (<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:like this one from Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/3AlMQ70">like this one from OXO</a>) instead of a microfiber cloth. You&#39;ll avoid damaging any of the sensitive components on the board. You can go over any non-electronic part with a dampened microfiber cloth.</p><p>At this point, all you need to do is put everything back in its place. As one final tip, if there&#39;s any way you can avoid leaving your desktop on the floor, you&#39;ll end up spending less time cleaning it since it won&#39;t be near all the dust and dander that collects there. If your desk setup or living space makes that not an option, a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:PC tower stand" href="https://amzn.to/3wv1h5w">PC tower stand</a> is a cheap but effective way to elevate your computer off the ground and help it pull in less debris.</p><h2>How to organize your PC’s storage drives</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9a356400-e95e-11eb-bdd5-ebb6c90f1cb8" alt="CleanMyPC" data-uuid="f719834d-dced-3287-8b20-d0197dfcc9b2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">MacPaw</div></figure><p>If it&#39;s been a while since you&#39;ve done an audit of all the software you have installed on your computer, the best place to start is in the Task Manager. It&#39;s here you can see how much of its resources your computer is devoting to specific processes. Since everyone will have different software installed on their PC, it&#39;s hard to offer blanket recommendations, but using the Task Manager you can get a sense of the apps that may be slowing down your computer. For most people, there will be two main culprits: bloatware and antivirus software.</p><p>If you bought your PC from a system integrator like Dell, it will almost certainly include software your computer doesn&#39;t need to operate. So you can safely uninstall those apps to improve performance and save on space.</p><p>This next tip may be contentious for some, but I believe as long as you avoid clicking on sketchy links and stay away from the dark corners of the internet, Windows Defender is all you need to protect your computer from the majority of malware that&#39;s out there. While there are good antivirus programs like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Bitdefender" href="https://fave.co/3y93LYf">Bitdefender</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Malwarebytes" href="https://fave.co/3hfeM3D">Malwarebytes</a>, the majority cost far too much for what they offer and will only slow down your computer. If you don&#39;t feel comfortable uninstalling your antivirus software, then by all means, leave it on your computer.</p><p>While you&#39;re in the task manager, you&#39;ll also want to click on the &quot;Startup&quot; tab to see what programs your computer is launching when you power it on. You can speed up that process simply by limiting that list to as few apps as possible. As for the actual process of deleting any software you don&#39;t need, always uninstall programs from the Control Panel as this will leave the fewest leftovers when everything is said and done. If you&#39;ve used Windows for a while, you&#39;ll have errant files, folders and registry entries all over the place. It&#39;s possible to cull those manually, but doing so can be time-consuming. So we recommend using a program like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:Iolo System Mechanic" href="https://bit.ly/3jmG3nr">Iolo System Mechanic</a> or <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:CleanMy PC" href="https://fave.co/3dqhDWu">CleanMy PC</a> to complete a deep clean of your system.</p><p>If you have any mechanical drives installed in your computer, it&#39;s good to get into the habit of defragging them regularly. First, launch the built-in Defragment and Optimize Drives app and click the &quot;Optimize&quot; button. Depending on the size of your hard drive, this process may take a while. Don&#39;t defrag your SSDs, as you&#39;ll only shorten their lifespan for little to no performance improvement.</p><h2>How to organize your apps, tabs and other windows</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/99bd5860-e95f-11eb-b7df-13ff2efddd51" alt="Melbourne, Australia - Jun 13, 2016: Clicking the Windows Store icon on Surface Pro 4. It is an app store for Microsoft Windows, allowing users to download apps, ,games, music, movies and TV shows." data-uuid="797e7fa4-1a62-3b1b-b0bb-2951b3eeabef"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">ymgerman via Getty Images</div></figure><p>Say what you will about Windows 10, but the fact is it comes with some of the best window management tools built right into an operating system. You don&#39;t need to download any additional software to organize your desktop, but there are some settings you can tweak to get even more out of its signature Snap functionality.</p><p>As you may already know, you can press the Windows and Tab keys at the same time to bring up the Task View pane. It&#39;s here that you can add additional virtual desktops. If you&#39;re not already using virtual desktops, they&#39;re great for organizing your active windows so that you don&#39;t have to constantly rearrange them when you&#39;re trying to find a specific one. You can quickly press the Windows key, Ctrl and either the left or right arrow keys to move between desktops. But to make things even simpler, head to the Settings app and into the Multitasking section of the System menu. Under the &quot;Virtual desktops&quot; heading, switch both settings to &quot;All desktops.&quot; You can now use the Alt-Tab shortcut or taskbar to switch to any app on any desktop.</p><p>When it comes to wrangling your tabs, a lot of that will depend on the browser you use. But as a decent starting point, all the most popular ones include a feature that allows you to pin tabs. I use this to keep the websites I visit most frequently throughout a workday (in my case, Gmail, Trello and Google Drive) open at all times and at the top of my tab bar. In that way, those tabs never get lost among the countless other websites I might have open for a story I&#39;m writing.

The company has <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/how-were-introducing-womens-football-football-manager">revealed</a> that it&#39;s adding women&#39;s soccer (aka football) to its management sim. This will likely be a &quot;multi-year&quot; project, SI warned, but this also isn&#39;t a simple character model swap. The studio wants to offer the same kind of depth it has for men&#39;s sport while accounting for the differences between players and leagues.</p><p>There will be new models and databases, of course. However, SI noted that it also has to account for different league rules, gender differences in text translations (the most expensive part of the project) and tweaks to different player attribute systems. The company also has to decide whether or not it accounts for certain practical realities of women&#39;s soccer, at least at first — does it factor in menstruation and pregnancy, for example?</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The team recently hired coach and research expert Tina Keech to lead its women&#39;s soccer efforts, and there are already motion capture sessions underway.</p><p>The expansion will likely prove costly. SI expects adding women will &quot;cost millions,&quot; and it&#39;s looking for sponsorship deals that could help fund the project. However, the company believes there&#39;s a moral imperative to add women to the game — it wants to &quot;smash&quot; the glass ceiling for women&#39;s soccer and help it get the same attention given to men&#39;s leagues. In other words, <em>Football Manager</em> will be part of a larger sports equality campaign that includes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-08-11-ea-sports-women-in-games.html">games like <em>FIFA</em></a> as well as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-05-fox-sports-fifa-womens-world-cup-2019-4k-streaming.html">better TV coverage</a> of real-world matches.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/football-manager-womens-soccer-145306757.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c41697dc-d248-4144-9e1d-ee074df00a60</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2021 14:53:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627050804</ingested><modified>2021-07-23T14:33:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Soccer]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/07fc7030-ebbe-11eb-bc6b-e96871405d36" width="3021" height="2053" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/07fc7030-ebbe-11eb-bc6b-e96871405d36" width="3021" height="2053" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Benoit Tessier / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Soccer Football - Women's Champions League - Round of 16 First Leg - Paris St Germain v Sparta Prague - Georges Lefevre Stadium, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France - March 9, 2021  Paris St Germain's Luana in action with Sparta Prague's Eliska Sonntagova and Lucie Martinkova  REUTERS/Benoit Tessier]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[SOCCER-CHAMPIONS-PSG-SPP/REPORT]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Google Pixel 4 is on sale for $380 at Woot]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#39;ve been on the hunt for a capable Android phone that won&#39;t break the bank, there&#39;s a solid deal over at Woot that&#39;s worth checking out.

Woot&#39;s parent company Amazon and B&amp;H Photo were both selling the Pixel 4 for $400 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-4-sale-amazon-bh-131509963.html">earlier this month</a>.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy Pixel 4 (64GB) at Woot - $380" href="https://fave.co/36TtJnh">Buy Pixel 4 (64GB) at Woot - $380</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As you might expect from a Google smartphone, the Pixel 4 has great cameras. It has a &quot;smooth&quot; display system that can boost the refresh rate from the typical 60Hz to 90Hz. The device will also support <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-beta-hands-on-181528378.html">Android 12</a> and it&#39;s quick enough for most use cases.</p><p>Overall, the Pixel 4 might be better value than the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-samples-specs-price-150053038.html">Pixel 4a 5G</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5-review-camera-performance-battery-price-150051832.html">Pixel 5</a> right now. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-samples-specs-price-150053038.html">Pixel 4a</a>, meanwhile, costs $350 and arrived a year after the Pixel 4, but Google downgraded some of the specs — the display only has a 60Hz refresh rate and there&#39;s just a single rear camera, rather than two.</p><p>There are a few provisos to bear in mind with the Pixel 4. Google will provide Android and security updates for the Pixel 4 <a href="https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705?hl=en#zippy=%2Cpixel-phones">until October 2022</a>, but there&#39;s no guarantee it will continue to do so after that time. Phone and online support might not be available after then either. Meanwhile, the device&#39;s screen brightness and battery life don&#39;t quite match up to equivalent flagships from Apple and Samsung.</p><p>It&#39;s worth noting Woot&#39;s <a href="https://www.woot.com/faq?ref=w_ngf_rp#what-is-woots-return-policy">return policy</a> is more limited than that of Amazon. You can send back most goods within 30 days and Woot will reduce the refund amount by the cost of return shipping (as long as the product isn&#39;t defective or damaged). So, if you do snap up a Pixel 4 while it&#39;s on sale, it&#39;s probably best to decide quickly if you want to hang onto it.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-4-sale-woot-deal-android-smartphone-142609460.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ad6075c4-c8b0-45be-85b2-84daf931ac87</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2021 14:26:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627050372</ingested><modified>2021-07-23T14:26:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Conglomerates]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e87c1920-ebbf-11eb-9b7f-4d738be930cb" width="2400" height="1600" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e87c1920-ebbf-11eb-9b7f-4d738be930cb" width="2400" height="1600" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Pixel 4]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Pixel 4]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Alphabet's latest moonshot aims to make industrial robots more practical]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Alphabet has launched another company in its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-30-chronicle-cybersecurity-alphabet-moonshot-x.html">X moonshot factory</a>, and this one may be its most ambitious <a href="https://www.engadget.com/alphabet-x-mineral-223517153.html">robotics project</a> to date. The <a href="https://blog.x.company/introducing-intrinsic-1cf35b87651">just-opened</a> firm, Intrinsic, plans to make <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-11-adidas-abandons-robot-speedfactories-in-germany-and-the-us.html">industrial robots</a> more accessible to people and businesses that couldn&#39;t otherwise justify the effort involved to teach the machines. You could see robotic manufacturing in more countries, for example, or small businesses that can automate production that previously required manual labor.</p><p>Intrinsic will focus on software tools that make these robots easier to use, more flexible and more affordable. To that end, the company has been testing a mix of software tools that include AI techniques like automated perception, motion planning and reinforcement learning. Company chief Wendy Tan-White has relevant experience, too. She started the &quot;world&#39;s first&quot; software-as-a-service site builder to make web development more accessible, launched early online banking and lending services, and helped nurture startups as a VP at X.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The technology is still early, but there are already promising results. During its development time at X, the team trained a robot to make a USB connection in two hours (instead of programming it over hundreds of hours) and had robotic arms build simple furniture (shown below). Automation wouldn&#39;t be &quot;realistic or affordable&quot; for efforts like these using existing technology, Intrinsic said.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/fc9c3ea0-ebb8-11eb-bcfe-b0c7bc6d40eb" style="height:288;width:512;" alt="Intrinsic industrial robots use perception, force control and planning to assemble furniture" data-uuid="62c3587c-7651-3591-80ba-ea6eaaf1d93c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Intrinsic/X</div></figure><p>The new company still has much work to do. It&#39;s now focused more on creating a practical product and &quot;validating&quot; its tech. It&#39;s also hunting for partners in car manufacturing, electronics and healthcare that currently use industrial robots. If Intrinsic succeeds, though, it could make robotics more equitable and fill gaps in production. The company even suggests that its work could help the environment — the closer robotic factories are to people, the lower the emissions needed to transport goods to customers.</p><p>This might prove challenging. Rethink Robotics spent years developing collaborative robots that learn through simple human guidance, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-04-rethink-robotics-shuts-down.html">only to shut down</a> as sales fell short. X moonshot companies also aren&#39;t guaranteed to succeed — look at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/loon-shutdown-014334705.html">Loon&#39;s fate</a> as an example. Alphabet&#39;s money could help where companies like Rethink struggled, however, and Intrinsic is focused more on solving overall robotics problems rather than specific scenarios. This effort might stand a better chance than most.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/alphabet-x-intrinsic-industrial-robot-moonshot-140057232.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4eb581f6-049c-4f48-8b00-c8bad8d26785</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2021 14:00:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627046831</ingested><modified>2021-07-23T13:27:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9097a1c0-ebb0-11eb-bbed-4c2bfbfd69dd" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9097a1c0-ebb0-11eb-bbed-4c2bfbfd69dd" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Intrinsic/Alphabet]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Intrinsic logo for Alphabet X moonshot covering industrial robots]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Intrinsic logo for Alphabet X moonshot covering industrial robots]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[HTC Vive Pro 2 review: An excellent 5K headset for the VR faithful]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="88c991e8eae740c89c33f4761ce96090"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kATHHeP4Wfo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:HTC Vive Pro 2" href="https://bit.ly/3rvYTdZ">HTC Vive Pro 2</a> is a VR enthusiast&#39;s dream. Its 5K 120Hz display delivers the sharpest desktop VR experience I&#39;ve ever seen. And while its design hasn&#39;t changed from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-03-htc-vive-pro-review.html">2018 model</a>, it&#39;s still very comfortable to wear for extended sessions. But its high price and reliance on old controllers make it a tough sell. And let&#39;s be honest, it&#39;ll take a lot to dethrone the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-review-vr-facebook-headset-173026291.html">$299 Oculus Quest 2 </a>as the ideal VR headset for mainstream users.</p><p>That&#39;s not who HTC Vive is really targeted at, though. Like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/htc-vive-focus-3-review-standalone-vr-headset-163044765.html">standalone Vive Focus 3</a>, this headset is clearly geared towards professionals. But unlike that device, it also has plenty to offer gamers. For them, spending $1,399 on the entire Vive Pro 2 package would be worth it to play <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-23-half-life-alyx-review-valve-vr.html"><em>Half Life: Alyx</em></a> in the best quality possible. And if you&#39;ve already invested in the previous <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-03-htc-vive-pro-review.html">Vive Pro </a>or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-28-valve-index-review-vr.html">Valve Index</a>, you can nab the new headset on its own for $799.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="96cb55eb-ae39-425c-b5f5-a7064c3f8924"/><p>Just be sure to keep track of which Vive Pro is which, because they look practically identical. The Pro 2 features a black and purple color scheme, but its front facia, strap and headphones all look the same as before. The difference becomes clear once you put on the Vive Pro 2, though: Its 5K screen offers 2,448 by 2,448 pixels per eye, a huge leap ahead of the 1,440 by 1,600 pixels from the Pro. Plus the Pro 2&#39;s LCDs have RGB sub-pixels, which helps make everything look sharper still. The screen can also refresh at up to a 120Hz, which is noticeably smoother than the previous 90Hz panel, and I appreciated the wider 120-degree field of view, which makes virtual worlds feel all the more immersive.</p><p>These specs may sound familiar, because the Vive Focus 3 also has the same 5K screen, it just happens to have a slower 90Hz refresh rate. But I came away far more impressed with the Pro 2, because it can easily run any PC VR game or app. The Focus 3, meanwhile, has a limited selection of mobile titles, and I was never able to successfully stream higher-end VR from my gaming PC. And, honestly, even if I got that to work, streaming is still a clear step down from running natively.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e35896d1-eb10-11eb-b7ff-c8fd80773144" alt="HTC Vive Pro 2" data-uuid="31169255-820a-32dc-9309-a7c6c02fe00e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>I revisited old and newer games on the Pro 2, and everything just looked fantastic. I kept getting distracted by the detailed environments in <em>Half Life Alyx</em> — a game that looked great on the Index, but has an extra level of polish with the Pro 2&#39;s resolution bump. It&#39;s sort of like the jump from 1080p video to 4K. You might not notice the difference  at first glance, but once you start inspecting the finer details like grass and wood grain you can tell you&#39;re working with more pixels.</p><p>Hopping back into <em>Superhot</em> almost felt like I was playing <em>Superhot 2</em>. I could make out plenty more detail in the game&#39;s cyberpunk introductory room. And even though its aesthetic is relatively simple, the game&#39;s enemies, weapons and environments all looked more detailed than I remembered. I also spent more time than I expected gawking at just about everything in the VR version of <em>Hellblade: Senua&#39;s Sacrifice</em>. That game already looked impressive on a normal monitor, but in 5K VR I could appreciate Senua&#39;s intricate character model even more.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e3556280-eb10-11eb-b21f-bf58f5bd8c30" alt="HTC Vive Pro 2" data-uuid="2f9c6e5f-6b10-3211-abeb-510c51cbfae4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>As impressive as everything looked, though, I really wish HTC had upgraded the Pro 2&#39;s controllers. Its full kit includes the same enormous wands that came with the original Vive in 2016. They work decently enough, but they&#39;re not nearly as ergonomic as Oculus&#39;s touch controllers, or even the Focus 3&#39;s gamepads. They&#39;re particularly archaic after experiencing Valve&#39;s hand-tracking Steam VR controllers, which are bundled with the Index. Since it&#39;s a SteamVR headset as well, you could always use the Index gamepads with the Pro 2, but that&#39;s another $280 on top of an already expensive headset.</p><p>It also would have been nice to see HTC Vive upgrade the Pro 2&#39;s design a bit. It&#39;s still very comfortable, thanks to its plush cushioning along the front and back, as well as its balanced weight distribution. But the company could have taken a few cues from the Valve Index. Near-field speakers would have been a solid upgrade from on-ear headphones, especially since the Pro 2&#39;s cans tended to make my head feel warm. The headset&#39;s displays also generate a decent amount of heat as well, which led to some sweaty play sessions.</p><section data-eng-breakout="b0517a70dc3e47d6b435c5e237d35897" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e35848b0-eb10-11eb-af55-098a6d678d74" alt="HTC Vive Pro 2"></section><p>Setting up the Vive Pro 2 also takes a bit of work, but that shouldn&#39;t be a surprise to VR heads. It requires having two SteamVR base stations set up in opposite corners of your room, as well as USB 3.0 and DisplayPort cables running to a breakout box. If you&#39;ve already got base stations from the original Vive Pro or Valve Index, they&#39;ll still work. And if you don&#39;t, be sure to pick up the full Pro 2 kit, which includes the base stations and VR wands.</p><p>To get the most out of the Vive Pro 2, you&#39;ll also need to make sure you&#39;ve got some serious graphics power. I tested it on a system running an NVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti, AMD Ryzen 7 5800X and 32GB of RAM. That was enough to get smooth performance at the headset&#39;s full resolution, though I couldn&#39;t tell if I was always reaching 120fps to fill its refresh rate. I didn&#39;t notice any stuttering or slowdown, though. True VR aficionados typically stuff even more absurdly powerful hardware in their systems, so I&#39;d wager they&#39;d have a similar experience. But you can probably forget about getting anything truly usable out of the Vive Pro 2 using its minimum system requirements (a GTX 1060 and 4th-gen Intel CPU).</p><p>If you&#39;re stuck with slower hardware, and you don&#39;t want to fight to the death for a new GPU, you&#39;ll be better off with a less demanding VR headset. The Oculus Quest 2 remains my main recommendation for most people, since it offers excellent standalone virtual reality, as well as a simple way to connect it to your PC to stream high-end experiences. HP&#39;s Reverb G2 is another solid option based on its resolution alone, though I&#39;m not the biggest fan of its controllers.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e3556282-eb10-11eb-abf7-28cf22db9b3a" alt="HTC Vive Pro 2" data-uuid="1ce0d5ea-8817-3bdd-8b97-47ad3bf256ae"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>I’ll admit, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:Vive Pro 2" href="https://bit.ly/3rvYTdZ">Vive Pro 2</a> doesn’t sound like a great deal if you compare it to practically any other VR headset on the market, especially at its full $1,399 price. It’s in many ways an example of the greatest issue facing VR today: To get the best experiences, you’ll have to shell out a ridiculous amount of money, not to mention deal with a clunky setup process and annoying cables. That’s not stopping true virtual enthusiasts though — for them, and for businesses who need the highest quality VR around, the Vive Pro 2 is the new benchmark.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/htc-vive-pro-2-review-5k-vr-headset-133100685.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">062c2ddb-bc72-46b9-9a2a-cc4813619420</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2021 13:30:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627071568</ingested><modified>2021-07-23T20:19:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e3553b70-eb10-11eb-adbb-58d3a3230e93" width="2000" height="1045" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e3553b70-eb10-11eb-adbb-58d3a3230e93" width="2000" height="1045" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[HTC Vive Pro 2]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[HTC Vive Pro 2]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
