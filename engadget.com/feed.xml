The iFixit team said removing batteries from recent MacBook Pros required &quot;infinite patience, a bottle of isopropyl alcohol, and an optional bottle of human-friendly alcohol.&quot; They expected the same from this generation of laptops but were pleasantly surprised by the presence of pull tabs instead when they <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/54122/macbook-pro-2021-teardown">tore down</a> the new MacBook Pros.</p><p>The outer battery cells have noticeable pull tabs that you can, well, pull to detach them from their adhesive underneath. Even the central battery cells have pull tabs — they&#39;re just harder to find inside the laptop chassis beneath the trackpad. iFixit was able able to confirm that the laptops will recognize and work with battery replacements just fine.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition, most of the laptops&#39; ports, except for the SD card reader and the HDMI port, are modular. That means they can be easily and cheaply replaced if they suddenly break or malfunction. Conversely, the laptops&#39; keyboard will still be hard to replace, but hey, at least the days of Apple&#39;s butterfly keyboard are now <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-20-apple-macbook-air-2020-first-look-keyboard-true-tone-display.html">over</a>.

Devindra Hardawar reviewed the latest <a href="https://amzn.to/3pPw0dV">14-</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/3w4vauL">16-inch MacBook Pros</a> and reports back that they provide almost everything one could want out of a powerful laptop. Billy Steele spent time listening to the third-generation AirPods and concluded they sound much better than the previous version. And Cherlynn Low used Google’s Pixel 6 and 6 Pro and found that the camera-heavy handsets have a lot more to offer, including a great starting price.</p><h2>The new MacBook Pros have a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-book-pro-14-16-inch-review-2021-apple-mighty-macs-130011975.html">ton of power (and ports)</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/86d0a220-38ec-11ec-a5b3-8a860be049ef" alt="Apple MacBook 14- and 16-inch (2021)" data-uuid="b1825893-d730-3e58-a67d-89d139389744"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Devindra Hardawar says the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:14-" href="https://amzn.to/3vZ88Wj">14-</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:16-inch MacBook Pros" href="https://amzn.to/2ZyVocC">16-inch MacBook Pros</a> are precisely what media professionals have been waiting for: speedy M1 Pro and Max processors, a comfortable keyboard, serious battery life and great speakers. They also feature most of the crucial ports MacBooks have been missing for years, including (finally!) an SD card reader, though the laptops are thicker and heavier as a result. And of course, all that comes with a high starting price of $1,999.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Devindra was particularly impressed by the Liquid Retina XDR displays, which come close to 4K resolutions, and have mini-LED backlighting to produce up to 1,600 nits of brightness. He was also pleased to find support for 120Hz refresh rates, and by the benchmark testing in which both MacBook Pros blew away competing Windows PCs. However, while the laptops were able to speedily convert a 4K video clip to 1080p, Devindra doesn&#39;t think they&#39;d make the best gaming machines — trying to load <em>Borderlands 3 </em>produced an unplayable mess. Overall though, he says these computers have practically everything one, especially a creative professional, would want in a powerful notebook — as long as you can stomach the price tag.</p><h2>The third-gen Airpods have a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-review-2021-160026883.html">better fit and more features</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/11b916b0-38ed-11ec-bdd2-cd470a053d1c" alt="Apple AirPods 3rd-Gen (2021)" data-uuid="f6c7b56c-986d-3366-9ee0-114255c6ccff"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Apple’s latest <a href="https://amzn.to/31jfWqF">AirPods</a> have been almost completely redesigned from the previous version; the buds themselves have a new look, courtesy of the contoured shape which reduces weight and features a tapered silhouette and an angle to increase comfort. Billy Steele says the company’s efforts to build better AirPods have paid off: the new buds are more comfortable and and have much better audio quality, with bigger and more immersive sound that remained open and airy. That’s thanks to a custom driver paired with a high-dynamic-range amplifier, as well as the new H1 chip and the inward facing mic. Billy says these changes made the AirPods something he actively wanted to listen to music with.</p><p>The new AirPods also have an IPX4 rating so they’ll survive sweaty workouts or small splashes. They can also detect skin which, combined with the built-in accelerometer, makes for more accurate pausing and extends battery life. The new chip means you can listen to tracks in Dolby Atmos on Apple Music, and the spatial audio is available with dynamic head tracking to change the position of the audio when you turn your head. However, the latest AirPods still lack active noise cancellation and Transparency mode as these features are still reserved for the pricier AirPods Pro. While Billy acknowledges that these earbuds aren’t for everyone, he says they continue to offer Apple users features that are well integrated with iPhone, iPad and Mac.</p><h2>Google’s Pixel 6 and 6 Pro are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro-review-specs-camera-samples-battery-test-160014200.html">excellent phones with great prices</a>&nbsp;</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fbc195f0-38ef-11ec-a9e2-fd44c6629b33" alt="Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro " data-uuid="df05aa6a-db9f-30d8-bcc6-522c84a7426a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>Cherlynn Low says the newest Google phones — the <a href="https://amzn.to/3bnGoRv">Pixel 6</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/3mpn6l0">6 Pro</a> — are the most intriguing phones that the company has made in years. Featuring the first Google mobile processor, Tensor, the two handsets also have improved camera hardware, lovely OLED screens, speedy refresh rates (120Hz for the 6 Pro, 90Hz for the 6), and decent speakers. Cherlynn says the best feature is the surprisingly low starting price — only $599 — which makes some of the drawbacks more forgivable.</p><p>One of the issues she had with the phones was the laggy under-screen fingerprint sensor, which requires the display to be on before it unlocked — a process that she says doesn’t need to have two steps. She was more impressed by the new voice keyboard, which did an excellent job of transcribing speech, and the additional camera features. The sensors are sharper and bigger with larger pixels, producing bright, clean photos — and special camera features, like Magic Eraser and Face Unblur, give users a lot of control over their photos. The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro excelled in our battery tests, too, lasting 20.5 hours and 17 hours, respectively. Overall, Cherlynn calls the handsets a superb return to form, showing off Google’s strengths in the software and photography departments.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/icymi-apples-new-macbook-pros-have-nearly-everything-youd-want-160049252.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">634b1803-994b-413e-9fbe-b22038c853a8</guid><dc:creator>Amber Bouman</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 30 Oct 2021 16:00:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635539639</ingested><modified>2021-10-29T20:34:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Amber Bouman]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fc26a961-350a-11ec-aeed-d392d87d8e2c" width="2000" height="1241" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fc26a961-350a-11ec-aeed-d392d87d8e2c" width="2000" height="1241" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[MacBook Pro 14-inch (2021)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[MacBook Pro 14-inch (2021)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's worst shipping delay is for a $19 polishing cloth]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You&#39;d think <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canalys-smartphone-shipments-q3-2021-190214915.html">global supply shortages</a> would hit Apple&#39;s tech products the hardest, but that&#39;s apparently not the case.

Order the microfiber cloth from the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MM6F3AM/A/polishing-cloth">company store</a> as of this writing and you&#39;ll wait 10 to 12 weeks — in other words, you won&#39;t get your Apple-branded polishing experience until January 2022 at the earliest. You could buy a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-book-pro-14-16-inch-review-2021-apple-mighty-macs-130011975.html">new MacBook Pro</a> and wait another two months to (officially) wipe smudges off the screen.&nbsp;</p><p>It&#39;s not clear what prompted the backlog, but it might be sheer popularity. An anonymous Apple official talking to <em>The Times</em> said the company wasn&#39;t surprised by high demand, and that the cloth was both specially designed (it was originally meant for the nano-texture glass on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-24-apple-mac-pro-white-papers.html">Pro Display XDR</a>) and particularly effective.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s no secret that you can find far, far less expensive alternatives if you&#39;re cleaning a regular screen.

At this point, it’s iconic but with a design that hasn’t changed much since 2016, it recently started to show its age. Thankfully, SteelSeries just announced the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Arctis 7+" href="https://fave.co/2ZJxcEX">Arctis 7+</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Arctis 7P+" href="https://fave.co/3EwTuZ4">Arctis 7P+</a>.</p><p>The tweaks the company has made are modest, but they’re ones current Arctis 7 owners will appreciate. Most notably, SteelSeries has replaced the finicky micro USB port you used to charge the headset with a more modern USB-C connection. Using the new port, it’s possible to get three hours of uptime after 15 minutes of charging.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f31d1a40-38f0-11ec-a6b7-3b40ab31ec12" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="Arctis 7+" data-uuid="826f3caa-c504-3672-938c-3009701b4f7e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">SteelSeries</div></figure><p>On that note, battery life is also improved. SteelSeries claims you can get up to 30 hours of gameplay on a single charge, up from the approximately 24 hours you got from the previous version. As for the differences between the 7+ and 7P+, there aren’t many. You can buy the latter in both black and white colorways where the former is only available in black. Additionally, the 7P+ includes support for the PlayStation 4 and PS5’s 3D Audio functionality. That said, you can use both headsets with pretty much any system or device other than Xbox consoles.</p><p>The Arctis 7+ and Arctis 7P+ are available to buy today from the <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__nyl.as_t1_294_8u56lfixcjmqaajkwio84hcb6_2_11d0ed3b19c29a96a30f592a5b5930e03c8f7153b6ff78dbe663c4a4aaed4985&amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;c=sWW_bEwW_mLyN3Kx2v57Q8e-CRbmiT9yOhqES_g_wVY&amp;r=lpQ468hfON-YVPYCoKRWx9nLjHJnve1xEz23vLxo-Yc&amp;m=ehdInLXexLYqy7pJy-Cu4IBi9bKZHrX-IuaUBKQIlQE&amp;s=8V8KUb1_KuoDHp4Xwma_BS7zP3pKqNmPffnHMBfu78I&amp;e=">SteelSeries website</a>. They’ll both set you back $170. That’s an increase from the $150 MSRP of Arctis 7 and 7P, but what&#39;s an extra $20 when you don&#39;t have to deal with micro USB anymore.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/steelseries-arctis-7-7plus-annoucement-195740872.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">886ba982-655b-41ac-aeb8-13a090068db0</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 19:57:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635537465</ingested><modified>2021-10-29T19:57:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d4e47050-38f0-11ec-bfed-777eea110f83" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d4e47050-38f0-11ec-bfed-777eea110f83" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SteelSeries]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Arctis 7+]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Arctis 7+]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tesla recalls nearly 3,000 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles over separating suspensions]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tesla is <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2020/TESLA/MODEL%252520Y/SUV/AWD#recalls">recalling</a> 2,791 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles over concerns that their front suspension lateral link fasteners may loosen, potentially shifting the wheel alignment and increasing the risk of a crash.

On Friday, Marvel announced its working with Hennig’s Skydance New Media studio on a new <a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/games/skydance-new-media-marvel-entertainment-all-new-interactive-title"><ins>narrative-driven action-adventure game</ins></a> set in its comic book universe.

When she left EA after the publisher <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-17-ea-shuts-down-visceral-games.html"><ins>shut down Visceral</ins></a>, it seemed like she wanted a change of pace. &quot;I would love to have a little company of about six to eight people, 15 at the most, and then do smaller projects,&quot; she said at the time. But then the possibility of working with Marvel may have been too difficult to ignore, especially for a new studio working on its first-ever game. Much like it’s done in Hollywood, the company has started to pull in talent from every corner of the gaming industry.

It’s called greenwashing.</p><h2>What is Greenwashing?</h2><h3></h3><p><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/greenwashing"><ins>Merriam-Webster</ins></a> defines greenwashing as “expressions of environmentalist concerns especially as a cover for products, policies, or activities.” The term was first coined in 1986 by environmentalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Westerveld"><ins>Jay Westerveld</ins></a> in an essay examining <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923212726/http://www.dailyfinance.com/2011/02/12/the-history-of-greenwashing-how-dirty-towels-impacted-the-green/"><ins>the hotel industry’s practice</ins></a> of leaving placards in guest rooms admonishing them to reuse their towels to help “save the environment.” Back then, people <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/20/greenwashing-environmentalism-lies-companies"><ins>got their news from three places</ins></a>: newspapers, television and radio — the same sources for virtually all advertising at the time. This information availability imbalance created a system wherein corporations could promote themselves in any flattering shade they wished, regardless of their actual actions, with little fear of the public actually realizing that a deception had even occurred.</p><p>The practice of greenwashing in America goes as far back as 1953 — though it wasn’t called as such at the time — when beverage manufacturers launched the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/08/05/899391551/reframing-history-the-litter-myth"><ins>Keep America Beautiful</ins></a> campaign, reminding the public to be good environmental stewards and not litter, in what was actually an effort to forestall incoming regulations on the use of disposable containers. Greenwashing metastasized in the 1980s as Big Oil companies ladled out their own laudations while they <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/sep/19/shell-and-exxons-secret-1980s-climate-change-warnings"><ins>sought to minimize their own liability and culpability</ins></a> in <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-exxonmobil-20170822-story.html"><ins>environmental pollution scandals</ins></a> and global warming. These companies went so far as to work to actively prevent the government from <a href="https://influencemap.org/report/Climate-Lobbying-by-the-Fossil-Fuel-Sector"><ins>passing clean energy laws</ins></a>. But you wouldn’t know it from their television ads.</p><div id="3e43c1176cca4f3a85044c65bfdafa02"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:75%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bReBO55XzZc?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The spot above is from ​​Chevron’s People Do campaign.

If these experiences tell us anything, it&#39;s that the Exxon tiger hasn&#39;t changed its stripes.&quot;</p><h2>Greenwashing in the modern era</h2><h3></h3><p>Greenwashing remains a widely-used marketing tactic even today — and not just the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq-ZupAJTyY"><ins>mealy-mouthed word salads regurgitated by oil executives</ins></a> during a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/28/climate/oil-executives-house-disinformation-testimony.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytimes"><ins>House Oversight Committee hearing this Thursday</ins></a>.</p><p>Take bottled water, for instance.

Coca-Cola came under fire in 2015 in Australia when it rolled out Coke Life, a supposedly light sugar variant packaged in a bright green can.

Because it is far more profitable to simply adjust public perception than it is to make meaningful reforms. <a href="https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/analysis/2015/the-sustainability-imperative-2/"><ins>A 2015 Nielsen poll</ins></a> found that 66 percent of respondents would be willing to pay a premium for “environmentally sustainable products” and among those willing to pay more more than 50 percent were influenced by sustainability factors such as “a company being environmentally friendly (58 percent), and company being known for its commitment to social value (56 percent.)”</p><p>It’s also because we, collectively, keep falling for it. Consumers’ desires to help address the climate crisis, especially in the face of barely tepid responses from world governments, primes us to view virtually any action on that account as a positive one. “SDGs [<a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals"><ins>Sustainable Development Goals</ins></a>] and ‘net zero’ have kind of created an opportunity for a lot more greenwashing, because it allows you to describe yourself as a green company when you’re doing a thing that’s fundamentally not green,” Dave Powell, co-presenter of the <a href="http://www.sustainababble.fish/"><em><ins>Sustainababble</ins></em></a> podcast and the former Head of Environment at the New Economics Foundation, told <a href="https://www.clientearth.org/latest/latest-updates/stories/greenwashing-the-tipping-point/"><em><ins>Client Earth</ins></em></a>. “You effectively buy your way out of trouble, for example, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-07-30/what-happens-after-pledges-to-plant-millions-of-trees"><ins>by promising to plant large numbers of trees</ins></a>.”</p><p>&quot;As part of their climate strategies, many companies are relying on voluntary carbon offsetting. However, if not done well, offsetting can result in greenwashing,” Dr. Aoife Brophy Haney, Research Lecturer at the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment at the University of Oxford, added. “To mitigate this risk, government and society at large should support the use of best practice guidelines, such as the recently released ‘<a href="https://www.smithschool.ox.ac.uk/publications/reports/Oxford-Offsetting-Principles-2020.pdf"><ins>Oxford Principles for Net Zero Aligned Carbon Offsetting</ins></a>’, to help ensure offsetting is done in a rigorous and credible way that ultimately contributes to net zero goals.&quot;</p><p>And, most importantly, companies continue to engage in greenwashing because there is very little downside to doing so, at least from a regulatory perspective. In the US, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/environmental-claims-summary-green-guides"><ins>the FTC guidelines for environmental marketing claims are only voluntary</ins></a>, though the FTC does retain the right to <a href="https://sustainablebrands.com/read/marketing-and-comms/ftc-cracking-down-on-misleading-unsubstantiated-biodegradability-claims"><ins>prosecute outright false or misleading advertisements</ins></a>.</p><p>However, cracks in the greenwashing facade may be beginning to show, starting in the financial sector, as regulators’ interest in <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/best-esg-funds#:~:text=ESG%20funds%20are%20mutual%20funds,funds%20are%20not%20individual%20stocks."><ins>ESG fund</ins></a> (environmental, social and governance) oversight grows. As <a href="https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/greenwashing-probes-prompt-panic-among-esg-funds-theres-a-big-reputational-risk-20211025"><em><ins>Financial News London</ins></em></a> reported Monday, German asset manager DWS <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-06/deutsche-bank-s-dws-orders-fresh-probe-into-esg-greenwash-claims"><ins>has recently been investigated</ins></a> by both US and German regulatory agencies after a former employee accused the company of fudging the environmental credentials in its 2020 annual report.</p><p>“You have to be careful, as there is a big reputational risk,” an unnamed senior executive at a European asset manager, told <em>FN London</em>. “We’re not saying we were bulls***ing before, but there’s a recognition now that it’s more complicated.”</p><p>“Most have probably been a bit too pushy in marketing their alleged ESG expertise and they are now applying more caution,” ​​Philip Kalus, managing partner at consultancy Accelerando Associates, added. “Some would even say there is panic in the house. Nobody wants to be the next one being accused, but it is an important and overdue wake-up call for the industry.”</p><div id="79b61a221f15426c812e2a6aaed705a7"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MbHuSHGZf5U?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>That’s not to say that environmental pledges made by Apple, Google, Microsoft or Amazon are meant to intentionally gaslight the public (though Exxon, Shell and Chevron absolutely did). These companies have a vested financial interest in at least appearing as positively as possible to their customers because, frankly, nobody’s going to have time to talk about the slick new features of the Pixel 8 or iOS 15 when we’re in the midst of a global climate meltdown-slash-<a href="https://www.undispatch.com/bad-news-world-will-begin-running-water-2050-good-news-not-2050-yet/"><ins>water war</ins></a>.</p><p>Is Google’s “moonshot goal” of operating its data centers and campuses entirely on carbon-free energy by 2030 going to make more than a blip of difference when it comes to mitigating the impacts of climate change? Probably not, definitely not on its own and certainly no more so than Microsoft’s promise to reduce water use in its data centers by 95 percent by 2024 or Apple’s plan to build robots <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-03-21-apples-liam-robot-takes-apart-your-iphone-for-recycling.html"><ins>to more effectively recycle old handsets</ins></a>. But these claims do not, in and of themselves, constitute greenwashing. Their changes may not be enough to make a noticeable impact at this point, but these good faith efforts attempt to do something, <em>anything</em>, to stave off what could well be humanity’s self-inflicted extinction. And given how America’s most recent effort to invest in environmentally responsible energy technologies was single-handedly killed off by the coal-loving Senator from West Virginia, these sorts of corporate initiatives may likely be the best we’ll soon see.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/is-big-tech-greenwashing-its-environmental-responsibilities-ahead-of-cop-26-170038455.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f44f9aad-26dd-4c9e-b58b-9bbaf124bd48</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 17:00:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635525046</ingested><modified>2021-10-29T16:31:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Climate Change]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/2353c710-3868-11ec-bef7-14f30f9a0ec8" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/2353c710-3868-11ec-bef7-14f30f9a0ec8" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM - 2021/10/24: An activist dressed as a 'scrubber' cleans the 'greenwashing machine' during the protest outside the Science Museum.

Viewers were instantly obsessed, labeling her &quot;tall vampire lady&quot; and demanding to know everything about her, which prompted Capcom to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/resident-evil-village-dimitrescu-tall-lady-020513974.html">reveal her exact height</a> — 9&#39;6&quot; including her hat and heels — months before <em>Village</em> launched in May.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In-game, Lady Dimitrescu commands three fly-infested, murderous daughters, and hunts the main character, Ethan Winters, across the opulent rooms of her castle.

Earlier this year, Miyazaki shared details with Engadget about how Lady Dimitrescu came to be, from concept to mocap, including the ways actress Maggie Robertson brought her to legendary life.</p><p><strong><em>Engadget:</em></strong><strong> Did Lady Dimitrescu&#39;s design change throughout development?</strong></p><p><em>Masato Miyazaki:</em> Alcina Dimitrescu’s incredible height was conceived from the beginning and was not changed during development. The same goes for her wide brim hat and her white dress as well. However, the characteristic of her long protruding nails was something added part way through the development process. It was an idea that was implemented later as a means of adding physical elements that would make her more terrifying when you encounter her.</p><p><strong>Lady Dimitrescu is alluring and seductive </strong>—<strong> was she always meant to be a sultry character, or did that emerge during mocap?</strong></p><p>In the early stages of development, she was described as a bewitching character who would capture and toy with her victims. She was designed to embody equal parts beauty and horror. Based on this, the scenario writer fleshed her characterization out even further with dialogue, but she wasn’t fully realized just yet. It was through Maggie’s performance that the character was finally given life.</p><p>As with any character, I believe that the moment the script is handed over to the actor, the character becomes theirs. The character&#39;s personality and intentions are very much refined by the actor. The character Lady Dimitrescu was truly realized and came to fruition with each of Maggie’s performances.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fe295820-3834-11ec-a44b-5486ec0bd096" alt="Lady Dimitrescu (Maggie Robertson) in Resident Evil Village" data-uuid="944ebc48-bc9c-34a5-abc5-b0d7327e2427"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Capcom</div></figure><p><strong>What tricks did you use to make Maggie Robertson as tall as possible during mocap sessions?</strong></p><p>Although Maggie Robertson is quite tall herself, she still cannot reach the height that we envisioned for Lady Dimitrescu. Utilizing some means of extending out her height would jeopardize her performance, so it wasn’t something we could consider. We asked Maggie to act naturally. However, that still left us with the height difference between Maggie and Lady Dimitrescu that had to be addressed. We devised a few methods to counteract this issue.</p><p>First off, we shot with a mixture of backgrounds according to two standards: human scale and Lady Dimitrescu scale. While other characters performed with surroundings that fit human scale, Lady Dimitrescu’s acting was done in front of a background that fit her scale. Everyone performed with one another, but with this mixture of environments. We figured this would be the best means of allowing the actors to give their best performances without any kind of impediment. We made sure the furniture was laid out in a way so that the actors would be facing each other.</p><p>The other aspect that we made sure to stay conscious of was making sure the actors’ lines of sight were in the right positions. We set up markers so that the actors could imagine the correct height. These markers show the correct position of the eye lines and where the limbs actually are. It&#39;s a simple adjustment, but it makes a big difference in the actors&#39; performances.</p><div id="b57949c2c9fd4690a3b380e2e834efcd"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">How the sausage gets made part 2: This is what we used to mark Lady D&#39;s actual size and eye lines.

We carefully set up the rigs of the CG characters to gracefully handle as much of the physical differences between the character and actor as possible. We wanted to make sure that we set things up so that the animators would have a relatively easier time handling any kind of miscalculations that happened along the way.</p><p><strong>What was the strangest prop you used throughout the mocap process?</strong></p><p>There are several, but there are two that I would like to mention. The first is the cane carried by the old woman we meet at the beginning of the village. When you see it in the game, it’s a strange artifact with a lot of components jingling about. The studio crew crafted a prop that resembles the design.</p><p>The second is the goggles that our actor Todd wore as he played the role of Ethan Winters. Since the game is from a first-person perspective through the eyes of Ethan Winters, the camera movements are based on the movements of Todd&#39;s head. Todd reprises his role as Ethan from the previous game and his performances are absolutely excellent, but there were moments where the camera would go wild during more heated scenarios. In order to suppress this from happening, the studio engineer created a pair of special goggles by hand.&nbsp;</p><p>They actually turned out to look very similar to swimming goggles. The assumption was that the narrower field of vision would result in less head movement. I’m still not entirely sure how effective they ended up being, but the engineer’s enthusiasm and Todd having fun wearing the goggles are one of the many wonderful memories I have from the whole experience.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/resident-evil-village-lady-dimitrescu-mocap-interview-halloween-2021-163032866.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9b3a5bf4-595d-4788-842b-80db5c238754</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 16:30:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635524142</ingested><modified>2021-10-29T16:15:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/8831d780-3836-11ec-bfe7-b1f747ceb39f" width="870" height="473" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/64ebd7d0-3836-11ec-b3ee-895b0690b883" width="1280" height="720" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Capcom]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Lady Dimitrescu]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Lady Dimitrescu]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[We won't have electric airplanes until battery tech improves]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today’s commercial airliners are not exactly fuel efficient.

Currently, 2- and 4-person <a href="https://www.diamondaircraft.com/en/flight-school-solution/electric-aircraft/"><ins>small aircraft outfitted with electric power systems</ins></a> typically operate at 250-270 Wh/kg of specific energy but industry experts expect energy densities will have to hit 350 - 400 Wh/kg before the electric aviation industry really takes off — something that could happen within the next few years, according to Tesla CEO, Elon Musk.</p><div id="6dcdf8fc78334eb4af505dd26fc73351"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">400 Wh/kg *with* high cycle life, produced in volume (not just a lab) is not far.

When a battery cell, or even an area within a single cell, malfunctions due to mechanical, thermal, or electrochemical failure, its temperature can rise beyond safe levels causing the cell to first produce lithium off-gasses, causing the cell walls to bulge, then rupture, releasing the entirety of its energy reserve. When a cell bursts it can damage and overheat surrounding cells, setting off a cascading failure that results in explosion and fire. When that happens to a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-recalls-chevy-bolt-over-battery-fire-reports-230044311.html"><ins>Chevy Volt</ins></a>, the car will likely be a write off (fingers crossed it didn’t also set your house on fire) but if <a href="https://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/251352/251352.pdf#page=187"><ins>such a failure</ins></a> were to occur in-flight on an electrified 747, the loss of life would be catastrophic.</p><p>To minimize the chances of a full-blown runaway from occurring, <a href="https://www.energy-storage.news/preventing-thermal-runaway-in-lithium-ion-energy-storage-systems/"><ins>early detection of cell failures is key</ins></a>. As off-gassing typically occurs minutes before a cell ruptures, the presence of a monitoring system which compares sensors positioned close to a li-ion battery against those collected by a reference sensor further away can alert for the presence of a failing cell. And to negate any gases that have already been released, fire suppression systems armed with inert gas — to prevent the offgasses from reaching combustible levels when mixed with atmospheric oxygen — can be employed as well. Of course regular maintenance and robust inspections also help prevent cell failures before the situation becomes explosive.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4f3cafc0-373e-11ec-bfff-d4dbaf919a6b" style="height:1365;width:2048;" alt="Spirit of Innovation" data-uuid="4c5c22ac-9ece-31e7-ad42-e873a391ba40"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Rolls-Royce</div></figure><p>Battery electric planes will also provide unique challenges in balancing air speed and range, though for Rolls-Royce, it’s not even a question — speed all the way. Over the past few years, Rolls-Royce has been quietly working on <a href="https://www.rolls-royce.com/innovation/accel.aspx"><ins>Project ACCEL</ins></a> (accelerating electrification of flight), building a battery-powered racing plane, dubbed <em>Spirit of Innovation</em>, in an effort to set a new world air speed record.</p><p>The record was <a href="https://assets.new.siemens.com/siemens/assets/api/uuid:7ff949a8-679e-4922-b421-cc9d34909ede/PR2017040256COEN.pdf"><ins>previously set in 2017</ins></a> when an electric-powered <a href="https://www.aerospace-technology.com/projects/extra-330le-electric-aircraft/"><ins>Extra 330LE</ins></a>, using a Siemens eAircraft-built power plant, notched a 209.7 mph (337.5 kph) top speed over a 3-kilometer-long course. The feat was certified by the World Air Sports Federation (FAI) as the fastest electrically powered flight by an aircraft weighing less than 1,000 kg at takeoff, beating the previous record (set in 2013) by just over 8 mph (13 kph).</p><p>In addition to the 3-kilometer record, Rolls-Royce has the opportunity to also set FAI records for a 15km distance and “time to altitude,” basically how quickly the plane can take off and reach a specific height. “It needs to be a significant number,” Rolls-Royce Director of Engineering and Technology – Civil Aerospace, Simon Burr, told <a href="https://www.aerosociety.com/news/race-for-power/"><em><ins>Aerosociety</ins></em></a>. “We’re planning to fly over 300mph. We’ll see how high we can get to.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4f3cd6d0-373e-11ec-bd67-b44541a55daf" style="height:1365;width:2048;" alt="Spirit of Innovation" data-uuid="10cfcdf6-1ba0-3e12-8387-1feeb3921361"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Rolls-Royce</div></figure><p>For its attempt, Rolls-Royce — which is partnering with the UK’s <a href="https://www.yasa.com/"><ins>YASA electric motor manufacturer</ins></a> and start-up <a href="https://www.electro-flight.com/"><ins>Electroflight</ins></a>, which makes bespoke battery systems — has acquired a pair of <a href="https://www.nemesisnxt.com/kit/index.php"><ins>Sharp Nemesis NXT</ins></a> twin-seat air racers. One has been used for ground testing while the second will conduct the actual flights. The Nemesis NXT already holds the 3km FAI record with a recorded top speed of 415mph (667.8km) using a 400hp Lycoming internal combustion engine.</p><p>The Rolls-Royce team has swapped that Lycoming engine out for a trio of YASA 750v electric motors producing around 400kW (530hp) while the fuel tank has been replaced with three independent battery packs.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4f3fbd00-373e-11ec-bef9-7e9ade54bdcc" style="height:931;width:1980;" alt="Spirit of Innovation" data-uuid="c70f3aec-b5cf-3c58-937f-e55b28879658"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Rolls-Royce</div></figure><p>“The main challenge of electrification is weight,” Rolls-Royce Flight Test Engineer Andy Roberts said during a September media briefing. Not only did the 6,000-cell battery system aboard the Nemesis NXT shift the aircraft’s center of balance, the 450kg battery system also doesn&#39;t get lighter over time as conventional fuel tanks would, which could impact the plane’s performance during the later stages of the run. The batteries are so substantial that Rolls-Royce Chief Test Pilot Phill O’Dell had to lose 2kg of bodyweight to help keep the overall aircraft weight within operating margins.</p><p>Thermal runaway is a very real concern for the Rolls-Royce team, as they’ll be pushing these batteries to their absolute limits during the flight. In order to mitigate this issue cells are separated by liquid-cooling plates and stored in cork-wrapped fireproof cases (the porous cork material helps diffuse heat). Should a cell overheat to the point of venting off-gasses, the plane is equipped with an inert gas suppression and ventilation system as well.</p><div id="68c747635feb4e9bb8de9f8800ff27db"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="//dk79lclgtez2i.cloudfront.net/EC8aZkq" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>On September 15th, the <em>Spirit of Innovation</em> made its maiden test flight from the UK Ministry of Defence’s <a href="https://www.raf.mod.uk/our-organisation/stations/mod-boscombe-down/"><ins>Boscombe Down</ins></a> airfield, flying for 15 minutes. The company hopes to have the Nemesis ready for an official run at the record before the end of this year.</p><p>“The first flight of the <em>Spirit of Innovation</em> is a great achievement...  We are focused on producing the technology breakthroughs society needs to decarbonize transport across air, land and sea, and capture the economic opportunity of the transition to net zero,” Warren East, Rolls-Royce CEO, <a href="https://www.rolls-royce.com/media/press-releases/2021/15-09-2021-rr-all-electric-spirit-of-innovation-takes-to-the-skies-for-the-first-time.aspx"><ins>said in a statement</ins></a>. “This is not only about breaking a world record; the advanced battery and propulsion technology developed for this programme has exciting applications for the Urban Air Mobility market.”</p><p>Rolls-Royce is far from the only company pursuing electric aircraft technology, no matter how much faster it is than the competition. From tiny startups to industry stalwarts — <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/18/electric-planes-nasa-carbon-emissions"><ins>even NASA</ins></a> — companies and governments around the world are racing to develop commercially viable electric aircraft both for passenger flights and cargo hauling.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e3d50010-373e-11ec-9b33-aab6a0f73083" style="height:3068;width:4601;" alt="A prototype of an electrical air taxi by German company Volocopter is seen during a presentation at the Fiumicino airport, in Rome, Italy, October 27, 2021.

Both run on M1 processors, giving them powerful performance and making them the best laptop alternatives Apple has made yet. They also have 5G support, a USB-C port that double as a Thunderbolt connector with USB 4.0 compatibility and new Center Stage cameras. The latter works to keep you in the center of the frame when on video calls, and that will make a big difference whether you&#39;re on a Zoom meeting or just FaceTiming with your family.</p><p>Most people probably don&#39;t need 1TB of space, but it&#39;ll be useful if you&#39;re a creative professional using the iPad Pro for both work and play, or someone who wants to ditch their old laptop for a hybrid device.

Other than to reveal it was working with Subaru to develop the SUV and that it would include its upcoming e-TNGA powertrain, the company didn’t share many details about the bZ4X. On Friday, it changed that by unveiling the <a href="https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/toyota/36254760.html">production version of the vehicle</a>.</p><div id="3f43ff4b48d24e1c87df7c431171deb7"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d9qp2eoOWCk?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Toyota will offer the bZ4X in front-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive variants. The former will feature a single 150 kW capable of accelerating the car from zero to 100 kilometers per hour in 8.4 seconds. Per the WLTC standard, the automaker claims the FWD model’s 71.4 kWh battery will allow it to travel approximately 500 kilometers or 310 miles on a single charge. Expect that estimate to decrease once the EPA tests the car. It’s also worth noting these measurements come from the Japanese model, which may end up featuring different specifications to whatever model(s) Toyota releases in the US.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/7c2a78f0-38bf-11ec-b7e7-8fc2f2429f9c" style="height:1199;width:1600;" alt="bZ4X" data-uuid="2646e414-c151-377e-86d7-1cbb15b93e3d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Toyota</div></figure><p>The battery will support 150 kW DC fast charging, allowing it to go from dead to 80 percent after about 30 minutes of charging. As for the AWD model, it will feature two 80kW motors, one built into each axle, for a total power output of 160 kW. It can accelerate from zero to 100 kilometers per hour in 7.7 seconds. Toyota estimates the ranges of the AWD model at 460 kilometers or 285 miles on a single charge. In both variants, the battery is integrated into the chassis, a design choice the automaker helps lower the SUV’s center of gravity and improve the rigidity of the chassis.</p><p>Toyota also plans to equip the bZ4X with some nifty extra features. One of those is a solar roof the automaker says will generate about 1120 miles worth of free power generation. It will also offer a steer-by-wire system that removes the mechanical connection between the steering wheel and front wheels. Both features will be available in select models.</p><p>The bZ4X will debut in the US and other markets in mid-2022.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/toyota-bz4x-details-140056332.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">809b1336-cbdb-419e-9839-dc45faac014e</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 14:00:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635516060</ingested><modified>2021-10-29T14:01:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/54c3cd70-38bf-11ec-87ef-fa7aec7072a7" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/54c3cd70-38bf-11ec-87ef-fa7aec7072a7" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Toyota]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Toyota bZ4X]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Toyota bZ4X]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cricket brings 5G to all of its phone plans]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Cricket is no longer <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cricket-wireless-5g-launch-201240533.html">reserving 5G</a> for its priciest service tier. As of today, 5G is <a href="https://www.cricketwireless.com/cell-phone-plans">enabled</a> for all of the prepaid carrier&#39;s plans. As you might guess, the provider is also doing away with the modest 8Mbps cap on most of its plans. You can pay as little as $30 per month (for one line) for 5G, to put it another way — important if you&#39;re more interested in raw speed than anything else.</p><p>There are some caveats. Cricket isn&#39;t changing data caps for its two lowest-priced plans, so you could burn through the modest 2GB or 10GB allotments that much sooner. You also don&#39;t have many choices for 5G phones if you buy directly from Cricket, including the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html">iPhone 13</a> range as well as a handful of low-end Motorola and Samsung models. You&#39;ll still have a strong incentive to use the higher-end tiers, and you may want to bring your own phone.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s no secret as to why AT&amp;T is making Cricket more appealing, though. Cricket added 2 million customers (now 12.4 million total) in just the past two years. While AT&amp;T&#39;s regular service clearly has more overall subscribers, Cricket is the hotter property in terms of relative growth. Adding 5G to more plans could keep that momentum alive. And simply speaking, Cricket needed to catch up. Rivals like Boost Mobile and T-Mobile&#39;s Metro already offer 5G across multiple tiers. Your choice of prepaid carriers may now boil down to specific plan features and network quality.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/cricket-5g-no-speed-cap-all-plans-130022473.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3e582c85-e506-4d2c-8bda-ca695fe5d7d7</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 13:00:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635455629</ingested><modified>2021-10-28T21:13:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Cricket]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e4e5c400-3813-11ec-bfe7-50ec106670ff" width="4558" height="3043" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e4e5c400-3813-11ec-bfe7-50ec106670ff" width="4558" height="3043" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[William Howard via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Wilson, NC / March 29, 2018: A Cricket sign is displayed above the entrance to their retail store in Wilson, North Carolina.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Cricket cellular phone and wireless device storefront]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Assassin's Creed Infinity' game won't be free-to-play]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Assassin&#39;s Creed Infinity</em> won&#39;t be a free-to-play online game, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has confirmed during the developer&#39;s latest earnings call. <em>Bloomberg</em> first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/assassins-creed-infinity-live-online-game-service-135340262.html">reported</a> about the project&#39;s existence back in July, and the company has shared details about it bit by bit since then. The publication said that <em>AC Infinity,</em> which is the project&#39;s name that could change upon release, will be a live online service similar to <em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em> that requires you to own the base game. According to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-says-assassins-creed-infinity-will-have-all-the-elements-fans-love-not-free-to-play/1100-6497505/"><em>Gamespot</em></a>, Guillemot also said:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This game is going to have a lot of narrative elements in it. It&#39;s going to be very innovative game, but it will have what players already have in all the other Assassin&#39;s Creed games, all the elements that they love... right from the start. So it&#39;s going to be a huge game. But with lots of elements that already exist in the games that we published in the past.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Unlike other <em>Assassin&#39;s Creed</em> games with a single narrative story, <em>Infinity</em> will reportedly have multiple settings that will feel and look different from each other but will still be connected in some way. That means <em>Infinity</em> could have several games in one package, though how that will resonate with long-time fans remains to be seen. The original <em>Bloomberg</em> report also called it a massive online platform with room to expand in the months and years after its launch, so we may see new content hit the service as campaigns or seasons.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Ubisoft pooled its resources and unified the Montreal and Quebec teams, which previously worked on separate<em> Assassin&#39;s Creed</em> titles, to develop <em>Infinity</em>. Guillemot said it&#39;s still in its very early stages, however, and previous reports <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-infinity-confirmed-rumored-to-launch-2024-at-the-soonest-with-multiple-settings/1100-6493645/">said</a> its soonest possible release won&#39;t be until 2024.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-infinity-wont-be-free-to-play-124546762.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">61a4042c-4d10-4bf7-bcd6-9823b8e382fa</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 12:45:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635508902</ingested><modified>2021-10-29T12:01:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/1dcaaba0-38aa-11ec-aff2-3855ba047112" width="5303" height="3535" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/1dcaaba0-38aa-11ec-aff2-3855ba047112" width="5303" height="3535" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[JHVEPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Montreal, QC, Canada - September 6, 2021: Ubisoft Montreal sign at their headquarters in Montreal, QC, Canada.

It&#39;s based on the <a href="https://petapixel.com/2021/01/29/canon-reveals-price-and-more-details-for-its-ai-camera-the-powershot-pick/">PowerShot Pick</a>, an experimental, crowdfunded camera that was released only in Japan.&nbsp;</p><p>The PowerShot PX has pan-and-tilt functionality (340 degrees horizontally and 110 degrees vertically) and a 19-57mm (35mm equivalent) focal length range. The idea is that you you can place it a strategic spot, like on a table during a family picnic, for example. The camera can then scan the scene, find people&#39;s faces and automatically determine the best moment to capture a photo. &quot;The best photos aren&#39;t always the posed smiles.... the PowerShot PX captures a huge range of looks and precious reactions that you might not capture,&quot; Canon wrote.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="17b00c934869405aa98e288011e02c39"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rUqWnn8q7IY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>It can frame subjects &quot;intelligently to capture natural expressions and reactions,&quot; Canon says. You can also prioritize specific faces, like if it&#39;s someone&#39;s birthday. In theory, that would allow you to enjoy a gathering without the need to break away and take photos, knowing that it will be done automatically. You can also grab photos manually via an app or voice control.&nbsp;</p><p>Following an event, you can use the PowerShot PX&#39;s iOS or Android apps to get recommendations on the best photos to keep. Those are then stored on a memory card, where they can be uploaded to a computer. It supports WiFi and Bluetooth for smartphone connections, so you can control images with no need to check the device, Canon said. It can also double as a webcam via Canon&#39;s webcam utility app. (It runs on batteries with charging via USB-C.)</p><p>The PowerShot PX is coming to Europe and the UK in November 2021 for £500/€500 (around $585). There&#39;s no word yet on a release to North America or elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/canon-powershot-px-is-smart-home-camera-for-family-moments-121547584.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cc3767a6-a6b7-4a8c-a7e4-1dc4cad4dd5b</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 12:15:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635508696</ingested><modified>2021-10-29T11:58:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/7fa677c0-38a8-11ec-8daf-aff78100355a" width="1344" height="858" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/7fa677c0-38a8-11ec-8daf-aff78100355a" width="1344" height="858" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Canon's PowerShot PX captures candid images and video autonomously]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Canon's PowerShot PX captures candid images and video autonomously]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
