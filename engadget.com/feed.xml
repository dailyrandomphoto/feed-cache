The beta version of the Android Accessibility Suite — which was part of the fourth Android 12 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-beta-4-platform-stability-google-171004146.html">beta</a> that recently arrived on Pixel handsets — includes a neat new way to control your phone. &quot;Camera Switches&quot; essentially lets you use face gestures to complete a number of actions. For instance, you can set the app to detect when you smile or raise an eyebrow in order to open your notifications panel or quick settings. You can also open your mouth to scroll forward or backward. As spotted by <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-camera-switches-control-phone-with-face/"><em>XDA Developers</em></a><em>, </em>the update lets you map around six face gestures to over a dozen phone controls. These can also be tweaked based on gesture size to prevent the app from constantly initiating actions.</p><p>Camera Switches builds upon the Switch Access feature in Android Accessibility Suite, which lets you interact with your device without using the touchscreen. Depending on the context, this can be done using an external device, such as a keyboard, via a USB or Bluetooth connection, or by pressing the built-in buttons on your phone. In that sense, Camera Switches takes the feature up a notch by introducing gestures to the mix. Seeing as most people are already accustomed to unlocking their phones with their face, the new additions shouldn&#39;t seem completely foreign.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While using Camera Switches, you&#39;ll see a persistent notification icon that indicates your camera is being used. However, as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-beta-hands-on-181528378.html">Android 12</a>&#39;s privacy dashboard already includes a status indicator for both the camera and mic, this feature may be unnecessary. <em>XDA </em>was also able to sideload the app&#39;s APK to get the new feature on Android 11.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/android-camera-switches-control-phone-face-114800871.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6950ce5c-5fa3-4037-b105-757918adb2a4</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2021 11:48:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629114513</ingested><modified>2021-08-16T11:48:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a99d83f0-fe85-11eb-8ffd-2a99d94cc2b3" width="5607" height="3683" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a99d83f0-fe85-11eb-8ffd-2a99d94cc2b3" width="5607" height="3683" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Android logo is seen displayed on a phone screen in this illustration photo taken in Tehatta, West Bengal, India on April 27, 2021.

The Pixel 5a could appear any day now, according to the latest reports from, of all places, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5a-parts-leak-210709004.html">repair shops</a>. The latest rumors include a larger battery (4,680mAh battery up from 3,800mAh) and an August 17th release date — which would be tomorrow.</p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5a-parts-leak-210709004.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/8deb53b0-fe0a-11eb-b73f-19f1251153e0" alt="Google Pixel 4a 5G back from review" data-uuid="a3a82de8-5ace-3ed9-bda5-55a8e41a7708"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low/Engadget</div></figure></a><p>We’re already expecting the Pixel 5a to land with a dual-camera system and a headphone jack, the latter of which is rare in 2021.

Similarly priced phones may look the same on paper, but the Pixel’s imaging capabilities, which lean hard on AI and software, typically produce great images in most situations. I’m sure the Pixel 5a is likely to continue this winning formula — even if it lacks that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-pixel-6-pro-first-look-tensor-processor-better-cameras-160005582.html">homemade Google chip</a>.</p><p>— Mat Smith</p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-3d-printer-moon-regolith-iss-215332227.html https://www.engadget.com/...">NASA sends a 3D printing system for lunar soil to its space station</a></h2><h3>It could help plan for future Moon and Mars habitats.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-3d-printer-moon-regolith-iss-215332227.html https://www.engadget.com/..."><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b476c1d0-fd43-11eb-b379-6dbf01dfe68a" alt="Render of NASA astronaut holding Moon regolith" data-uuid="6b208123-7aa6-33de-8888-1f736ba5b874"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">NASA</div></figure></a><p>NASA&#39;s latest International Space Station resupply mission included a machine meant to demonstrate 3D printing regolith (loose soil or rock) on the Moon and similar extraterrestrial surfaces.</p><p>The Redwire Regolith Print (RRP) project will work in tandem with an existing printer system (ManD) to try 3D printing simulated regolith.

Chiefly, the Pro deliver superior sound thanks to their active noise cancelation and support for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/airpods-pro-firmware-update-spatial-audio-083143292.html">spatial audio</a>. Apple even claims the buds can customize your listening experience by using Adaptive EQ to tune music to the shape of your ear.&nbsp;</p><p>They look different to the AirPods, too. The Pro have shorter stems and are a bit wider, making for a more crowdpleasing design. While the addition of silicone ear tips in different sizes results in a more comfortable fit compared to the regular AirPods. They&#39;re also better gym buddies courtesy of their sweat and water resistance.</p><p>Seeing as the Pro dropped in 2019, you may be wondering about new upgrades. Rumors indicate that new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-third-generation-leak-205121774.html">AirPods</a> could be imminent this holiday season. Reports also claim that the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-next-gen-airpods-pro-smaller-design-121846608.html">next</a> AirPods Pro will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-new-air-pods-pro-fitness-2022-125843385.html">focus on fitness tracking</a>. Of course, none of that matters if you want to upgrade right away. In which case, you can&#39;t go wrong with the current Pros, especially if you&#39;re an iPhone owner. The lower price is the icing on the cake.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apples-air-pods-pro-fall-back-to-180-the-second-lowest-price-weve-seen-085820239.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8df7cacc-e4a8-4c16-997b-4074db09c53d</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2021 08:58:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629115670</ingested><modified>2021-08-16T12:07:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b3703de0-fe6d-11eb-bff8-f9ba0768a75b" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b3703de0-fe6d-11eb-bff8-f9ba0768a75b" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[AirPods Pro                                    ]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[AirPods Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[AirPods Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Switch is the first console to sweep Japan's game sales chart in 33 years]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-07-nintendo-switch-review-two-years.html">Nintendo Switch</a> isn&#39;t struggling to compete against the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-5-review-130048353.html">PlayStation 5</a> on its home turf in Japan... far from it.  <a href="https://twitter.com/GameDataLibrary/status/1426003162889134082">Game Data Library</a>, <a href="https://www.axios.com/nintendo-gaming-charts-195b69e0-4d16-44fa-90cf-c2305dad05de.html"><em>Axios</em></a> and <a href="https://in.ign.com/nintendo-nx-1/164591/news/nintendo-switch-sweeps-japanese-sales-chart-a-feat-that-hasnt-been-accomplished-in-30-years"><em>IGN</em></a> report that every game on <em>Famitsu</em>&#39;s August 8th weekly <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/ranking/game-sales/">Top 30</a> chart was a Switch title, ranging from <em>Super Mario Maker 2</em> in 30th place to <em>Minecraft</em> at the top. It&#39;s reportedly the first time a platform has swept that chart since November 1988, when Nintendo&#39;s own Famicom (the basis for the NES) dominated the list.</p><p>Nintendo has controlled the Japanese games chart with multiple platforms before. In the early 1990s, the Famicom, Super Famicom (aka Super NES) and Game Boy cemented its position. It&#39;s much harder for a single system to rule the rankings, though.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There&#39;s also a sharp contrast with the US. While the Switch has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/npd-video-game-spending-record-march-2021-144536464.html">outsold rival consoles</a> in the country and frequently thrives in game sales (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/zelda-skyward-sword-hd-nintendo-switch-230230304.html"><em>Skyward Sword HD</em></a> was July&#39;s best-selling game), it typically faces stiffer competition from the PlayStation and Xbox ecosystems.</p><p>There wasn&#39;t a direct explanation for the sweep, although the titles reflect both Nintendo&#39;s influence and local tastes. Most of the games are either Nintendo&#39;s (including <em>Skyward Sword</em> and <em>Mario Kart 8</em>) or come from franchises that have long been popular in Japan, such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-monster-hunter-rise-limited-edition-155516717.html"><em>Monster Hunter</em></a>, <em>Taiko no Tatsujin</em> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dragon-quest-12-041721411.html"><em>Dragon Quest</em></a>.

The <em>Wall Street Journal</em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/huawei-accused-in-suit-of-installing-data-back-door-in-pakistan-project-11628947988">reports</a> that American contractor Business Efficiency Solutions (BES) has filed a federal lawsuit accusing Huawei of not only stealing technology, but pressuring the firm into installing a data backdoor for a law enforcement safer-cities project in Lahore, Pakistan. The system supposedly gave Huawei access to a database that helped it collect sensitive citizen and government data &quot;important to Pakistan&#39;s national security.&quot;</p><p>BES alleged that Huawei insisted on creating a duplicate version of the Lahore network in Suzhou, China, that would provide direct access to the Pakistan data. While BES wanted permission from Pakistani officials before going forward, Huawei reportedly claimed it didn&#39;t need permission and initially threatened to cut off the deal if BES didn&#39;t move forward. The Chinese company later said it obtained permission, but apparently refused to provide evidence of this when asked.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The situation may not be clear-cut. Huawei told the <em>WSJ</em> there was &quot;no evidence&quot; it had installed backdoors in any products. In a statement from earlier in the dispute, the company acknowledged the duplicate system in China but maintained that it was strictly a test version &quot;physically isolated&quot; from the real network, making it impossible to extract data. An overseer for the Lahore effort, Muhammad Kamran Khan, said an investigation was underway but that there wasn&#39;t any evidence of data theft &quot;so far.&quot;</p><p>Whoever is telling the truth, the lawsuit highlights the ongoing concerns that Huawei might be aiding China&#39;s surveillance goals. The company has long denied the allegations, and there isn&#39;t yet &quot;smoking gun&quot; evidence that it has used backdoors to snoop on other countries. However, that hasn&#39;t allayed suspicions that have led the US, UK and others to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/huawei-files-us-lawsuit-disputing-fcc-security-threat-designation-172919533.html">blacklist its technology</a>. This case might only exacerbate Huawei&#39;s situation, even if BES&#39; assertions don&#39;t hold up in court.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/huawei-contractor-pakistan-backdoor-194308607.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b3d76098-7882-451e-99e1-37052c42347a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 15 Aug 2021 19:43:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629056591</ingested><modified>2021-08-15T19:43:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/199c07d0-fdeb-11eb-9feb-3d2676895ca0" width="5137" height="3363" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/199c07d0-fdeb-11eb-9feb-3d2676895ca0" width="5137" height="3363" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Wolfgang Rattay / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The logo of the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies is pictured next to a statue on top of a building in Copenhagen, Denmark, June 23, 2021.

Intelligence officer and initiative leader John Cohen told the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> in an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/homeland-security-considers-outside-firms-to-analyze-social-media-after-jan-6-failure-11629025200?mod=rss_Technology">interview</a> that Homeland Security is looking at hiring companies to analyze social networks for signs of impending terrorism and other extremist violence. The department had been studying social media before, but the outside partners would help &quot;dramatically&quot; expand these efforts, Cohen said.</p><p>Murmurs of extensive social media scanning first surfaced in May, but there were few details about how it would work. The rumors suggested Homeland Security would focus on alarming trends rather than individual targets, such as brewing extremist movements or threats against specific communities. The aim is to catch the violent rhetoric behind events like the January 6th <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-bans-stop-the-steal-ahead-of-inaguration-214239970.html">Capitol riot</a>, which Homeland Security didn&#39;t anticipate despite mounting social media activity.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>One of the companies involved in discussions is Logically, a firm that uses a mix of AI and human analysis to track online content at a large scale. It was previously involved in a government effort to fight <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-tool-voter-misinformation-report-190524785.html">voting misinformation</a>, but here could use publicly accessible social media to spot trouble.</p><p>Whether or not Homeland Security can address privacy fears is another matter. Cohen said the department wouldn&#39;t use companies to acquire information it was restricted from seeing, and <em>WSJ</em> sources said officials were determined to protect civil liberties. Logically chief Lyric Jain said his company couldn&#39;t share personal data for Americans without court orders.</p><p>Even so, there are concerns Homeland Security could abuse this private analysis.

An anonymous WarnerMedia executive <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/hbo-max-app-crash-problem-fix.html">talking</a> to <em>Vulture</em> claims the HBO Max team will replace all its smart TV apps with brand new versions inside of the &quot;next four or five months.&quot; Roku and PlayStation owners would receive the overhauled apps first, followed by Apple TV users near the end of 2021. Mobile and web viewers would have to wait until early 2022.</p><p>The existing apps have suffered from a number of serious flaws, ranging from broken playback controls to forgotten settings and sluggishness. Roku users have faced more problems than most, with lockups and crashes sometimes making the HBO Max app unusable.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The problems reportedly stem from WarnerMedia&#39;s scramble to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbo-max-price-availability-movies-shows-140049904.html">launch HBO Max in May</a>. Where many rivals built their streaming apps from scratch, the current HBO Max app is a repurposed version of the software meant for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbo-go-now-going-away-leaving-hbo-max-201659635.html">HBO Go and HBO Now</a>. It was built to handle high demand, but it wasn&#39;t meant to cope with an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbo-max-expands-to-39-new-territories-082604619.html">increasingly global</a> audience streaming much more than <em>Game of Thrones</em>.</p><p>An HBO Max app revamp will supposedly provide both modern underpinnings and, importantly, room to grow. The unnamed executive said the new app won&#39;t look much different at first, but should allow for a more &quot;sophisticated&quot; interface update as well as new and upgraded features.</p><p>If accurate, this could be important to HBO Max&#39;s long-term future. The TV streaming space is increasingly crowded with rivals like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-premiere-strange-energies-070032163.html">Paramount+</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/universal-films-tv-debut-peacock-041027104.html">Peacock</a> joining incumbents like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.

This week, Billy Steele lent his ears to Samsung’s new entry level Galaxy Buds 2 to check out their new design and features. A little while ago, Terrence O’Brien created beautiful music on the Novation Circuit Rhythm sampler and struggled with the controls on the SkulptSynth SE.

Redesigned to include wireless charging and ambient sound at an entry-level price of $150, the Galaxy Buds 2 are 15 percent smaller and 20 percent lighter than the Galaxy Buds+, which makes them comfortable to wear. Billy says that the sound quality, though improved, doesn’t have quite the same clarity and depth, but the dynamic range is comparable. Low-end tones lack punch and tracks that should sound big and bombastic are a bit flat and subdued.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That being said, he was still impressed by the inclusion of active noise-cancellation, which Samsung says can reduce 98 percent of background noise. Billy could still hear a bit of his box fans and white noise machine during testing, but the feature was definitely better than relying solely on passive isolation. He felt that Samsung delivered on the call quality improvements as well, via a combination of machine learning, three microphones per bud and a voice-pickup unit to maximize clarity. He managed to get around seven hours of battery life from “regular” use (which included some ANC), but was disappointed that the Buds 2 only have an IPX2 rating, which could produce issues during sweaty workout.</p><h2>HTC&#39;s Vive Pro 2 produces an incredible virtual reality experience — <a href="https://www.engadget.com/htc-vive-pro-2-review-5k-vr-headset-133100685.html">but it comes at a steep price</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e3553b70-eb10-11eb-adbb-58d3a3230e93" alt="HTC Vive Pro 2" data-uuid="6ae80b9d-4f42-3655-b669-12c7a13e7b8a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Devindra Hardawar liked <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:HTC&#x002019;s Vive Pro 2" href="https://fave.co/3zhTpWI">HTC’s Vive Pro 2</a> VR headset so much he called it “an enthusiast’s dream.” However, he’s quick to point out that its $1,399 price tag makes it a tough sell. The Vive Pro 2 offers a 5K 120Hz display with 2,448 x 2,448 pixels per eye. Additionally, the LCDs have RGB sub-pixels that help to produce the sharpest desktop VR experience that he’s ever seen. It also has solid ergonomics — Devindra says the headset is comfortable to wear for extended sessions due to its weight distribution and its plush cushioning on the front and back.</p><p>But even if you’re prepared to shell out for the headset, Devindra admits it comes with some drawbacks. First, the controllers are the same archaic, oversized ones that came with the original 2016 Vive. He also felt that the on-ear headphones produced some heat during use, as did the displays. But the biggest issue is the graphics power necessary to experience the device in its full glory: Devindra says you can probably forget about getting anything truly usable out of the system’s minimum requirements, which means you’ll need a lot of desktop power to get the most out of the Vive Pro 2. Despite those hurdles, he’s quick to call the Vive Pro 2 the highest quality desktop VR available right now.</p><h2>Framework’s modular laptop <a href="https://www.engadget.com/framework-laptop-review-150001399.html">can be repaired by anyone</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e1867930-e93f-11eb-8de5-0d0581187a5b" alt="Framework Laptop Hero Image" data-uuid="d5a7ef23-e2fe-38d2-bd6b-eb1e66dce77a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p><a href="https://frame.work/">Framework’s laptop</a> isn’t eye-catching or showy. The design of the 13-inch notebook resembles an older MacBook, but with one noteworthy difference: it’s intended to be modded and repaired via the included Torx T5 screwdriver and the expansion cards. While testing how easy it was to replace a keyboard, Daniel Cooper said he felt fully confident that he could make multiple repairs to the machine — something that can’t be said for most consumer laptops.</p><p>In addition to being easy to upgrade and fix, the Framework features a solid spec list: a 13.5-inch, 3:2, 2,256 x 1,504 display with a backlight capable of 400 nits; a variety of inputs via the expansion cards as well as a 3.5mm headphone jack; a chiclet keyboard with 1.5mm of travel and an impressive 1080p, 60fps webcam with an 80-degree field of view. During testing, the $1,399 Performance model handled undemanding games well and scored an average 4927 in PC Mark 10. The only thing Daniel didn’t enjoy about the machine were the side-firing speakers, which produced weak, tinny sound.</p><h2>The HTC Vive Focus 3 is a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/htc-vive-focus-3-review-standalone-vr-headset-163044765.html">premium VR workhorse</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2878f661-e4bd-11eb-b7bb-d183f7158f02" alt="HTC Vive Focus 3" data-uuid="f4f40b8c-822e-3409-9a78-d0ee1770933d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Much like the Vive Pro 2, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:HTC&#x002019;s Vive Focus 3" href="https://fave.co/36Ap6yd">HTC’s Vive Focus 3</a> isn’t intended for the casual consumer. The $1,300 price point alone puts it on another level, likely best for business users who should be pleased with the superior hardware, ergonomics and build quality. Devindra Hardawar says the system has just about everything you would want in a modern headset: a sturdy yet light build with a design that’s comfortable to wear for long periods of time, and even has support for large glasses.</p><p>With a 5K resolution, a 90Hz refresh rate and a 120-degree field of view, the Vive Pro 2 delivered one of the most immersive standalone VR experiences that Devindra has seen. He had a realistic sense of walking through meadows and beaches in a nature trek VR program, and said he was consistently impressed by how great everything looked. However, he was disappointed by the limited software library that required him to remove the headset to purchase apps and games. After his time with the Focus 3, Devindra heartily felt that it is an ideal set up for companies who can take advantage of the business-focused apps and the hardware quality without cringing at the price point.</p><h2>The SkulptSynth SE is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/modal-electronics-skulptsynth-se-review-virtual-analog-170031324.html">a formidable sound engine</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2db64c40-f3a4-11eb-aaf7-3621e0a8d368" alt="Modal Electronics SkulptSynth SE" data-uuid="c27a8af5-d3bb-3a6d-aec6-dedc56b7aafe"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>As a follow up to the original Skulpt, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:SkulptSynth SE" href="https://fave.co/3l5Z1zn">SkulptSynth SE</a> makes some upgrades to the build quality but comes in more affordable at $199. Terrence O’Brien spent some time with the instrument and determined that it’s still as powerful, compelling and confusing as the previous version. The SE features a total of 32 oscillators stacked in four voices which produces a thick tone that Terrence called inviting. He says the SE shines when the stacked oscillators are given a chance to really flesh out the sound. He also approved of the various modulation options, which give the device a surprising amount of depth.</p><p>Despite the improvements in the hardware (specifically firmer knobs), Terrence said that the SE still felt pretty wobbly and cheap overall. And he was still frustrated by the cramped layout and the navigation of the controls — he recommends keeping the included cheat sheet at hand to help with the latter. Additionally, the touch keyboard wasn’t always super responsive. However, using the app solved a lot of his complaints and he was excited about the MPE support, which is unheard of at the SE’s price point.</p><h2>Intel’s NUC 11 Extreme <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-nuc-11-extreme-review-practical-tiny-gaming-desktop-pc-130041721.html">offers gamers a full sized GPU</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/02366650-f033-11eb-9dbf-a36902acb4c4" alt="Intel NUC 11 Extreme mini gaming desktop" data-uuid="d3aa09bc-49ae-3c93-bf3b-44ecdd6faba6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Devindra Hardawar is quick to acknowledge that the new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:NUC 11 Extreme" href="https://fave.co/2VLRlZa">NUC 11 Extreme</a>, aka “Beast Canyon,” is pretty sizable. However, he feels the trade-off is worth it because the design provides support for a full GPU — something that should attract gamers to the unit. It’s also a bit cheaper than the last model and more flexible due to the fast 11th-gen Intel CPU (which can be purchased separately as an upgrade for NUC 9 Extreme owners).</p><p>This NUC was clearly designed with gamers in mind with an LED skull on the black metal case, mesh air vents and three large fans on top. Devindra was pleased to report that the case cooling on the device was excellent: the GPU never went above 75 celsius and the CPU stayed under 80 celsius. Additionally, because of the thoughtful modular design, he had no trouble fitting in large GPUs like NVIDIA’s RTX 3070 Ti or the Radeon RX 6800. The system also performed well in benchmark testing: in PCMark 10 it outpaced every Windows PC we’ve seen this year. Still, the $1,150 to $1,350 price tag for the NUC 11 is high, especially because owners will need to pay up for additional hardware and software.</p><h2>The Novation Circuit Rhythm is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/circuit-rhythm-review-a-solid-and-affordable-sampler-groovebox-130026004.html">entirely sample-based</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/44ecbdb1-eb32-11eb-ad6f-51f9f1a6a517" alt="Novation Circuit Rhythm" data-uuid="8bdda6e8-edaf-314f-9add-82d6eb07d1ff"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>Though physically similar to its cousin the Circuit Tracks, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Novation&#x002019;s Circuit Rhythm" href="https://fave.co/3sdLDLf">Novation’s Circuit Rhythm</a> uses the popular screen-free workflow of the Circuit with the full-featured sampler and performance effects of the SP-303 to produce a device that is ideal for lo-fi hip hop and house music.

Tap the button and you&#39;ll see a swipeable video collection from both the subreddits you&#39;ve subscribed to as well as related communities. As usual, you can upvote, downvote, comment on or gift awards.</p><p>A basic version of this experience was available before, but only if you tapped on a video — and the first videos you&#39;d see would come from the same subreddit.

While that company&#39;s code isn&#39;t being used for the feed (that will come with future products), the acquisition signalled Reddit&#39;s intent — it wants to keep its social network relevant in an era when video is all-important. You might not see video take center stage, but it&#39;s now considerably more than a nice-to-have feature.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/reddit-tiktok-video-feed-154754721.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">597fcd5d-006f-43ee-bf88-fdfeaadd72e7</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 14 Aug 2021 15:47:54 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628956076</ingested><modified>2021-08-14T15:48:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/83a0ce30-fd10-11eb-bbff-c613d2be23d9" width="5861" height="3906" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/83a0ce30-fd10-11eb-bbff-c613d2be23d9" width="5861" height="3906" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Yuriko Nakao via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[KATWIJK, NETHERLANDS - JANUARY 29: In this photo illustration, the logo of Reddit, a social news aggregation is pictured along with other apps, including Instagram and WhatsApp on a smartphone on January 29, 2021 in Katwijk, Netherlands.

That means that Green Bank, West Virginia has about as much tech today as it did in the 1950&#39;s (maybe even a little less) — and some people very much like it that way. But not everybody.

In early 2018, the Pocahontas County Commission passed a resolution in support of cell service throughout the county, a challenge to the very notion of a Quiet Zone. The commission assigned its attorney, Robert Martin, to contact all major telecommunications providers asking them to invest in Pocahontas.</p><p>“I’m doing my level best to get another company in here,” Martin told me in the spring of 2018. He’d invited me to his house to discuss the new cell service ordinance, and we were swigging Bud Lights at his kitchen table.</p><p>“How many cell companies have you written to?” I asked.</p><p>“All of them,” he said. “I promised the companies that we’ll get everybody in the damn county to sign up with them. I’ll sign up first! . . . I wrote a letter to everybody and said, ‘We have shit for cellphone service here, we want you to come in here, we’ll partner with you, we’ll help you however we can. Come in here.’”</p><p>At our feet were two boxers and a basset hound. In the adjacent mudroom was a 250-pound Vietnamese potbellied pig named Pig, who was snoring. Pig knew how to open the front door and pull a blanket over himself. “I’m the true image of West Virginia, aren’t I?” Martin laughed. “I got a pig living in the house.” Despite his home literally being a pigsty, Martin was always the best dressed at county meetings, usually wearing tight designer jeans, leather boots, and a crisp dress shirt, top buttons undone and a few chest hairs curling out. A blustery guy, Martin was once jailed in Marlinton for contempt of court for arguing with a circuit judge. He had a history of getting into fights at West Virginia University football games. For years, he’d also operated a hotel in Belize, paying “tens of thousands of dollars in bribes” and putting the payments on his tax returns so the U.S. government could see the corruption he was dealing with (even if he was admitting to violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act). Martin came across as a dogged lawyer who knew how to get things done. And he wanted cell service.</p><p>“You seen that commercial saying Verizon has more coverage than anyone else?” he asked me. “Pause and look at it real closely, and you’ll see right where Pocahontas County is because almost the entire Eastern Seaboard is all yellow [signifying cell coverage] and right there in southeastern West Virginia there’s this hunk about this big—it’s Poca-fucking-hontas County. I swear to God. Right fucking there we are on Verizon’s commercials.”</p><p>Martin knew well what connectivity was like outside the Quiet Zone. He had earned his law degree from West Virginia University in 1979, married a girl from Marlinton, and started his career in Pocahontas County before becoming a well-heeled insurance defense lawyer in Charleston. He’d gotten his first cellphone in 1986—it was the size of a beer bottle, with a three-foot-long antenna, and it went to bed with him every night. That attachment ended in 2012 when he moved back to Pocahontas, where he only carried an iPhone so he could listen to music in his truck. I asked if he was concerned about the impact of cell service on the electrosensitives.</p><p>“Wackos that are afraid of their brains getting fried and all that?” he responded. “Yeah, I know about them.”</p><p>“They see Green Bank as a haven,” I said.</p><p>“So? <em>So?</em>” He said he wasn’t going to let the electrosensitives keep Pocahontas “behind the curve” for cell service.</p><p>“But I’m here <em>because </em>you’re behind the curve,” I said. “That makes this place unique.”</p><p>“You think we want to deal with stone knives and axes for the rest of our existence? You’re like these fucking people who move in here and don’t want it to change, that it? We have people who have moved here in the last five to ten years and they don’t want anything to change. They’ve ‘discovered’ Pocahontas County and now <em>nothing </em>can change. Well, <em>fuck, </em>that ain’t the way of the world. We have limitations because of the observatory, because of our topography, because of our insignificant population. But we need to do what we can as government entities to make things available to people.”</p><p>“Of course,” Martin added, the cell service would have to comply with the Quiet Zone.</p><p>“We believe in the observatory, we don’t want to fuck with them,” he said. “Right now, as you and I are sitting here bullshitting, they’re up there looking for fucking E.T. And I want to give them every opportunity to do that. But I’ve got emergency services I’ve got to render in this county.”</p><p>In addition to trying to bring in cell service, Martin was assisting the county’s emergency services director, Michael O’Brien, to improve communications. The 911 center in Marlinton had difficulty broadcasting any emergency radio communications toward the northern end of the county, where Green Bank was located. O’Brien found a partial solution by installing an internet-controlled radio system just north of Green Bank in the town of Durbin, but it had minimal range and failed altogether when internet or electricity went down. Pocahontas was also one of the only counties in the state unable to adopt a “smart radio system” that integrated radios with smartphones.</p><p>On the off chance that someone made an emergency 911 call from one of the county’s few pockets of limited cell service, authorities had an especially hard time pinpointing the person’s location. “We had a dispatcher spend two and a half hours on the phone one night with a lady that was trapped in her car in a creek,” O’Brien told me. “She didn’t know where she was or how she got there. We were just keeping her calm while we sent the department to look in all the areas that had cell service.”</p><p>ACCORDING TO DELOIT TE, a 10 percent increase in mobile penetration increases total factor productivity—a key component of economic growth modeling—by 4.2 percentage points over the long run. In Pocahontas, businesspeople like Kenneth “Buster” Varner felt they needed all the help they could get to keep the county’s economy puttering along, which meant bringing in cell service.</p><p>I first met Varner in early 2017, while eating breakfast at the counter at Station 2. A heavy, jowly man, he had leaned over and asked, “Do you think the gravy is too salty?” As we shoveled down heaping plates of biscuits and sausage gravy, he told me about his various businesses. Aside from owning Station 2, he operated a half dozen enterprises involved in logging, excavation, towing, septic pumping, and auto repair. He was also a fire chief. I told him that I imagined a lot of headaches trying to manage all those things within the restrictions of the Quiet Zone.</p><p>“You have to realize that we never had cellphone service when everybody else had it, so it wasn’t anything to us,” Varner said. “It’d be more convenient, of course, if it was so you could use your cellphones all the time. But it’s a unique place to live where you don’t have them, and we take a little pride in that.” He noted how the observatory provided jobs and shared its resources, such as lending one of its diesel generators to a funeral home during a recent power outage. “That to me means a lot,” Varner said. “And having the largest telescope in the world out your back door, that’s a pretty neat conversation piece.”</p><p>“People can get ahold of me the old-fashioned way,” he added. “Call me on the landline or come look for me.”</p><p>Spending more time with Varner, however, I realized that he was hardly a Luddite. When we met again months later in his cluttered office, I found it hard to keep his attention. He kept glancing down at his iPhone to check texts and alerts he was receiving over WiFi. When he took a call, I was left to stare at a poster of a busty woman in a red bikini and firefighter helmet. When he finally put down the iPhone, I told him I was confused. Hadn’t he said he took pride in not using a cellphone?</p><p>“I thought it was rude to have a smartphone,” Varner said of his “old” perspective, apparently from just a few months earlier. “I do a lot of business on that phone, more than I ever thought in my wildest dreams that I would do.” I asked if he could ever go back to living without one. “Wouldn’t want to. It’s so handy.”</p><p>Varner had an AT&amp;T data plan. He used Siri. He wished all his employees and volunteer firefighters could always be connected through smartphones. Instead, because of the Quiet Zone, he’d invested more than $30,000 in a specially approved radio repeater system to allow his workers to communicate via low-band radio. “I don’t want the observatory to close and for people to lose their jobs,” he said, “but it’d be more convenient for everybody.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-the-quiet-zone-stephen-kurczy-harper-collins-153030420.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">288be526-c0d1-4fe0-8bea-7df5ae2d1e3b</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 14 Aug 2021 15:30:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628880763</ingested><modified>2021-08-13T18:52:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2faf94d0-fc63-11eb-a676-c495d7097fc4" width="3400" height="2275" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2faf94d0-fc63-11eb-a676-c495d7097fc4" width="3400" height="2275" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[The Washington Post via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[GREEN BANK, WV-JUNE 07: The Robert C.

Some robots, like iRobot&#39;s Roomba i7+ and S9+, go one step further by automatically emptying their bins into their clean bases after each job — so you rarely have to take out its trash. These gadgets come with high price tags, but you can grab either of them for less right now at Wellbots. The online retailer has the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Roomba i7+" href="https://fave.co/3dN1lpL">Roomba i7+</a> for $699, or $100 off, and the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:S9+" href="https://fave.co/3e1JhZm">S9+</a> for $949, or $150 off, when you use the codes <strong>100ENGADGET</strong> and <strong>150ENGADGET</strong>, respectively, at checkout. While not all-time-low prices, they&#39;re the best prices we&#39;ve seen since April.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy Roomba i7+ at Wellbots - $699" href="https://fave.co/3dN1lpL">Buy Roomba i7+ at Wellbots - $699</a><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy Roomba S9+ at Wellbots - $949" href="https://fave.co/3e1JhZm">Buy Roomba S9+ at Wellbots - $949</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Roomba i7+ is one of the more expensive robot vacuums you can get from iRobot and we gave it a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-05-roomba-i7-plus-review.html">score of 87</a> when it first came out. Not only did it do a good job cleaning both carpeted and hard floors, but it was also quieter than other robot vacuums we&#39;ve tested. The i7+ also has smart mapping technology so it can keep track of the rooms in your home to clean more efficiently. And like other robo-vacs, you can control the i7+ from your smartphone, plus set cleaning schedules, using the iRobot mobile app.</p><p>But the biggest thing that sets the i7+ apart from others is its clean base. After each job, the robot will automatically empty its bin into the clean base so you don&#39;t have to worry about it. The clean base itself can hold about 30 jobs worth of dirt, so it won&#39;t require constant attention either. The only downside are iRobot&#39;s proprietary bags that you&#39;ll have to buy for it.</p><p>Overall, the i7+ is a good pick if you want a robot vacuum that requires little attention on a daily basis. The Roomba S9+ has all of the same features plus a more corner-friendly design and &quot;power-lift suction,&quot; which should help it do a better job deep-cleaning carpets and capturing pet hair.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/irobot-roomba-i7-plus-s9-plus-deal-wellbots-130005973.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">99ece9ac-a06f-4e1a-ab10-93881db30595</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 14 Aug 2021 13:00:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628880609</ingested><modified>2021-08-13T18:50:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/2fb150e0-0a60-11eb-8eaf-ababb0cbeb12" width="640" height="411" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/2fb150e0-0a60-11eb-8eaf-ababb0cbeb12" width="640" height="411" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iRobot&#39;s high-end Roomba i7+ and S9+ are up to $150 off at Wellbots]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Warner Bros. 'Reminiscence' promo uses deepfake tech to put you in the trailer]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you want to see yourself on screen with Hugh Jackman, this is your chance. The promo for Warner Bros. upcoming <em>Reminiscence</em> movie uses <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lucasfilm-hires-shamook-054904077.html">deepfake</a> technology to turn a photo of your face — or anybody&#39;s face, really — into a short video sequence with the star. According to <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/next-up/warner-bros-deepfake-movie-promo?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1"><em>Protocol</em></a>, a media startup called D-ID created the promo for the film. D-ID reportedly started out wanting to develop technology that can protect consumers against facial recognition, but then it realized that its tech could also be used to optimize deepfakes.</p><p>For this particular project, the firm created a <a href="https://www.bannisterandassociates.com/">website</a> for the experience, where you&#39;ll be asked for your name and for a photo. You can upload the photo of anybody you want, and the experience will then conjure up an animation for the face in it. The animation isn&#39;t perfect by any means, and the face could look distorted at times, but it&#39;s still not bad, considering the technology created it from a single picture.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Reminiscence</em> is a sci-fi thriller about Nick Bannister, a &quot;private investigator of the mind.&quot; The idea behind the promo is that you&#39;re a client looking into your memories to solve a case. The movie will be shown in theatres on August 20th, but like most new releases these days, it will also be available for streaming on HBO Max.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/35d22650-fcbf-11eb-b557-b55ae3f25f9a" style="height:465;width:800;" alt="Reminiscence" data-uuid="058a5161-e976-3768-b845-6795518f9c54"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/warner-bros-reminiscence-promo-deepfake-trailer-052114554.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c509528e-e1fd-4c73-ab83-ce16064c0c97</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 14 Aug 2021 05:21:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628918539</ingested><modified>2021-08-14T05:22:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/edb18160-fcb7-11eb-9f93-328a6f20ec2d" width="1600" height="949" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/edb18160-fcb7-11eb-9f93-328a6f20ec2d" width="1600" height="949" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Warner Bros.]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Reminiscence]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Reminiscence]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple clarifies its sex abuse scans would look for 'images flagged in multiple countries']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple, which basked in praise from many corners after refusing to cooperate with federal authorities <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-02-16-judge-tells-apple-to-help-fbi-access-san-bernardino-shooters-ip.html">following the 2016 mass shooting in San Bernardino, California</a>, is now aggressively walking back <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-scan-iphones-child-abuse-neuralmatch-185009882.html">its plans to unilaterally scan customers&#39; phones for child porn</a> on behalf of governments following a swift and furious backlash from privacy advocates.

On Friday, a federal judge with the US International Trade Commission (ITC) made a preliminary decision related to a complaint the company had filed against Google in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-07-sonos-sues-google.html">early 2020</a>, alleging the search giant had infringed on five of its patents. Validating all five claims, the judge said Google should not be allowed to import devices that violate the intellectual property of Sonos.</p><p>&quot;Today the ALJ has found all five of Sonos&#39; asserted patents to be valid and that Google infringes on all five patents. We are pleased the ITC has confirmed Google&#39;s blatant infringement of Sonos&#39; patented inventions,&quot; said Sonos chief legal officer Eddie Lazarus. &quot;This decision re-affirms the strength and breadth of our portfolio, marking a promising milestone in our long-term pursuit to defend our innovation against misappropriation by Big Tech monopolies.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/13/technology/google-sonos-patents.html"><em>The New York Times</em> notes</a>, the judge&#39;s decision isn&#39;t final.

It accused the company of copying some of the technologies most critical to its speakers, including its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-29-sonos-trueplay-calibration.html">Trueplay tuning tool</a>. In patent disputes, companies typically use simultaneous ITC complaints to force the hand of their opponent since the body tends to resolve matters faster than a traditional court. Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-countersues-sonos-patent-infringement-132548465.html">subsequently countersued Sonos</a>, claiming the company had been using its search, software, networking and audio processing technologies without paying the proper licensing fees.

In a <a href="https://imgur.com/g0652ei?nc=1">customer survey</a> spotted by <a href="https://voicebot.ai/2021/08/10/sonos-surveys-users-about-potential-voice-assistant/"><em>VoiceBot.ai</em></a> and later <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623470/sonos-survey-voice-assistant-google-fight"><em>The Verge</em></a>, Sonos describes a system that would respond to the phrase “Hey Sonos” and allow users to control music playback, search for songs and move tracks between different speakers in their home.</p><p>Additionally, the company states the potential voice assistant would process requests locally, claiming that’s something that would allow it work faster. It also points to the privacy benefits of such a setup. “Sonos Voice Control interprets your voice entirely on the speaker, so no audio is sent to the cloud, stored, transcribed, or listened to by anyone,” the company says in the survey.  We’ll note here Sonos <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-20-sonos-buys-snips-to-improve-voice-control.html">bought a startup</a> that specialized in fast and private on-device voice processing in 2019.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A Sonos spokesperson told <em>The Verge </em>the company frequently collects feedback from its customers, but that it had no additional information to share<em>. </em>If Sonos plans to release its own voice assistant, it’s not hard to understand its motivations. After spending at least a year to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-14-google-assistant-sonos.html">get Assistant on its devices</a>, the company had a very public falling out with Google in 2020, culminating in an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-sues-google-190303052.html">ongoing legal spat between the two</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sonos-voice-control-survey-210304633.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4e66feea-d7cb-4199-b442-e597da626573</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 21:03:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628892609</ingested><modified>2021-08-13T22:10:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7e155f50-fc82-11eb-bb2f-d3aa96ee2af5" width="840" height="560" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7e155f50-fc82-11eb-bb2f-d3aa96ee2af5" width="840" height="560" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Ingraham / Jason Voorhees]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sonos Friday the 13th]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sonos Friday the 13th]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter has paused verification applications again]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Stop us if you’ve heard this one before, but Twitter has once again temporarily stopped accepting new verification applications from users.
