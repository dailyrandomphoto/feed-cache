To give you <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-wrapped-2021-140005862.html"><ins>another way</ins></a> to reflect upon 2021, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/instagram/">Instagram</a> is rolling out a feature called Playback.</p><p>Starting today, the app will create a Playback using up to ten of your Stories. You&#39;ll be able to remove some of the Stories and add your own through the Stories archive. A message will appear on the feed that asks if you&#39;d like to create or modify your Playback. Instagram says that if you see a Story with a 2021 sticker, you can tap on it to see and share your own Playback. The feature will only be available for a few weeks, so folks can &quot;celebrate and reflect on 2021 ahead of the New Year,&quot; according to Instagram.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Over the last few years, many Instagram users have been using third-party apps to create a collage of their <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-02-01-2015bestnine-instagram-dating-app.html"><ins>top nine</ins></a> most-liked posts of the year, which they can share in the main feed or Stories. Given how popular the top nice grid is each year, it would have been nice to see Instagram offer that feature in its own app. It seems Playback will have to suffice for now.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/instagram-playback-stories-2021-highlights-170046946.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">36e8715c-3cea-4824-a104-d5724e3ed471</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 17:00:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639062660</ingested><modified>2021-12-09T15:11:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/d06b0770-5900-11ec-bfb7-f80c20d47e20" width="1095" height="613" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/d06b0770-5900-11ec-bfb7-f80c20d47e20" width="1095" height="613" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Instagram]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A series of screenshots highlighting Instagram's Playback feature, which allows users to select and share up to 10 stories that sum up their year.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Instagram Playback]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Paramount+ adds live streaming channels for Star Trek, 'Survivor' and more]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/paramount%20plus/"><ins>Paramount+</ins></a> is offering folks another way to watch <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/viacomcbs/"><ins>ViacomCBS&#39;</ins></a> vast library of shows.

It&#39;s an upgraded version of the Instant Pot Duo, adding a lid that automatically seals shut when you close it. It&#39;s a 7-in-1 device, combining a pressure cooker, yogurt maker, rice cooker, cake maker, slow cooker, egg cooker and sauté machine into one. You&#39;re also getting a number of different one-touch cooking programs for things like soup, meat and stew, porridge and more, taking even more of the guesswork out of preparing a meal for your family. And with the 8-quart model, you&#39;ll be able to prepare a lot of food — it&#39;s arguably the best size for large families and those who entertain often.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The number of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-15-instant-pot-guide.html">Instant Pot models</a> has grown over the years to the point that there&#39;s almost a confusing number of these devices available. Some are more straightforward than others, like the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Duo Crisp" href="https://amzn.to/33h1eBl">Duo Crisp</a>, which includes an air-fry mode and comes with the appropriate lid for it. But the Duo Nova remains a solid option for newbies as it combines the convenience of a pressure cooker with a bunch of other functions in a relatively counter-friendly appliance. You may need to make a bit more space for the 8-quart model in your kitchen, but it&#39;s a small price to pay for all of the cooking time you&#39;ll get back while using it.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-8-quart-instant-pot-duo-nova-is-on-sale-for-59-right-now-162214336.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ba148b4a-9497-4ca7-ad9a-f1472d306749</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 16:22:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639067022</ingested><modified>2021-12-09T16:23:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/599c2380-590b-11ec-ba7b-13a7230cc18a" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/599c2380-590b-11ec-ba7b-13a7230cc18a" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Instant Pot / Walmart]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Instant Pot Duo Nova Walmart model]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Instant Pot Duo Nova Walmart model]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[NES and SNES creator Masayuki Uemura dies at 78]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s a sad moment for gamers. <em>Kotaku</em><a href="https://kotaku.com/masayuki-uemura-creator-of-the-nes-and-snes-dies-at-7-1848184264">reports</a> Masayuki Uemura, the lead creator of the Famicom and Super Famicom (aka NES and SNES), <a href="https://www-rcgs-jp.translate.goog/?p=1598&amp;_x_tr_sl=ja&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en-US">died</a> on December 6th at the age of 78. He started working at Sharp, where he sold solar cell and light sensor technology, but he&#39;s best remembered for a long and highly influential run at Nintendo that effectively revived the video game industry following <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-05-01-true-story-et-atari.html">the 1983 crash</a>.</p><p>Uemura first became involved with Nintendo after the company&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2007-10-04-gunpei-yokoi-passed-10-years-ago-today.html">Gunpei Yokoi</a> asked about using Sharp solar cells to produce light gun games. The future console designer joined Nintendo in 1971, and the company released gun games that included a home-friendly game called <em>Duck Hunt</em> (yes, the predecessor of the NES title). Company president Hiroshi Yamauchi put Uemura in charge of the R&amp;D2 division responsible for hardware, including consoles, and in November 1981 famously called Uemura asking him to  build a machine that lets you play arcade games on your TV. The result was 1983&#39;s Famicom, the system that would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nes-snes-designer-lance-barr-retires-145657155.html">become the NES</a> outside of Japan.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You know at least some of what happened next. The Famicom and NES were wild successes, selling nearly 62 million units combined and rejuvenating interest in home consoles. Uemura then led work on the Super Famicom, whose global launch as the SNES further cemented Nintendo&#39;s reputation. He also produced some NES games, including <em>Ice Climber</em> and three sports titles. He retired from Nintendo in 2004, but continued to serve as an advisor and would go on to teach and research video games as a professor at Ritsumeikan University.</p><p>It&#39;s hard to overstate Uemura&#39;s influence. The video game business as it exists today arguably owes much to the skill of Uemura and his team when they designed their first TV consoles. He also helped grow Japan&#39;s overall tech industry by making Nintendo a global force in electronics. While he certainly wasn&#39;t the only <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-07-12-nintendo-chief-satoru-iwata-dies.html">star at Nintendo</a>, he was one of the most directly influential.</p><div id="342235b5ea8b49fc8380a71e4ad026aa"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-9pBV2uc7Jc?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nes-snes-creator-masayuki-uemura-dies-142518818.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8a2e3320-9b4a-4b70-8f9e-6bfbbe8fab3a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 14:25:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639059994</ingested><modified>2021-12-09T14:26:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/e1071370-58f2-11ec-bef3-ed6090d6066b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/e1071370-58f2-11ec-bef3-ed6090d6066b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[ANA Global]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NES and SNES creator Masayuki Uemura]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NES and SNES creator Masayuki Uemura]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Shark's robot vacuum with AI navigation is 30 percent off today at Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The holiday shopping season is one of the best times of the year to look for a robot vacuum.

The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Shark AV2001 robot vacuum" href="https://amzn.to/3GsYsan">Shark AV2001 robot vacuum</a> with AI navigation is on sale for $300, or $130 off its normal price.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3GsYsan" id="cb4688e4c458484daf6e424d77475220" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Shark AV2001 at Amazon - $300</a><p>Shark took the top spot in our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html">budget robot vacuum guide</a>, and this model is more advanced and has more suction power than the one we tested. It has a self-cleaning brush roll that will help it pick up debris and even pet hair more easily, and it supports UltraClean Mode, which lets you deep clean specific rooms of your home. It moves through your home in neat rows thanks to its AI laser navigation system and it should bump into furniture less than other robo-vacs thanks to its ability to detect and avoid objects four inches high or taller.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The AV2001 also has precision home mapping with LiDAR, which means it&#39;ll learn the layout of your home as it cleans the first few times. You can then use the companion mobile app to send the machine to clean your bedroom only, and you can also set &quot;no-go&quot; zones to block off certain areas. The mobile app also lets you control the robot from anywhere and set cleaning schedules, and since it&#39;s compatible with Alexa and the Google Assistant, you could do all that with voice commands if you prefer. While it doesn&#39;t have a clean base like some higher-end robot vacuums do, it does come with a dock that it&#39;ll automatically return to once it&#39;s done cleaning or when it&#39;s battery has run low. All of those features make it a pretty capable robo-vac and a good option if you&#39;ve been holding out for a good deal on a mid-range device.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sharks-robot-vacuum-with-ai-navigation-is-30-percent-off-today-at-amazon-140021143.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">504086ec-b506-4c73-b263-4aa3445700a9</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 14:00:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639057479</ingested><modified>2021-12-09T13:44:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/131e56f0-58f5-11ec-b06e-cbf7c14e9094" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/131e56f0-58f5-11ec-b06e-cbf7c14e9094" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Shark]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Shark AV2001 robot vacuum]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Shark AV2001 robot vacuum]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tinder's 'Music Mode' is like a mixtape from potential dates]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In partnership with Spotify, Tinder has introduced Music Mode as part of its new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tinder-video-profile-update-130041493.html">Explore</a> section, letting you hear the &quot;Anthem&quot; songs of members when you swipe to their profiles — a sort of mixtape for dates, if you will.

It&#39;s also a simple way to send money without incurring fees. To do so, users will have to find their intended contact within WhatsApp, tap the paper clip icon on Android or the + icon on iOS in the text bar, select Payment and follow instructions on how to log into their Novi account.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Head of Novi Stephane Kasriel said on Twitter: &quot;We often hear that people use WhatsApp to coordinate sending money to loved ones, and Novi enables people to do that securely, instantly and with no fees.

After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-diem-association-us-111008891.html">facing pushback</a> from regulators around the world, though, the Diem Association shifted its focus, and Novi ended up using a stablecoin called the Pax Dollar (USDP) that&#39;s backed by the US dollar. On Novi, 1 USDP is equivalent to 1 USD. People won&#39;t be buying cryptocurrency when they use it, and it&#39;s simply money transfers that use stablecoin as an instrument. While sending USDP via Novi on WhatsApp has extremely limited availability for now, Kasriel said the service will look to expand its reach after getting feedback from users about the experience.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-novi-money-transfers-us-124027874.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">74068a86-ae34-461a-8ae0-322bdf1c53f0</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 12:40:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639054244</ingested><modified>2021-12-09T12:50:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a8bf1bc0-58e3-11ec-bfb7-80d315f8be2e" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a8bf1bc0-58e3-11ec-bfb7-80d315f8be2e" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Meta]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[WhatsApp]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[WhatsApp]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Future iOS update will help you spot third-party iPhone parts]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple’s incoming iOS 15.2 update includes a &quot;parts and service history&quot; section that indicates not only if the battery, camera and display have been replaced but also if they&#39;re <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ios-15-2-genuine-repair-parts-174546070.html">officially sanctioned Apple parts</a>.

Amazon holds a position of &quot;absolute dominance&quot; in the Italian brokerage services market, &quot;which has allowed it to promote its own logistics service, called Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA),&quot; the authority wrote in a (Google translated) press release.</p><p>According to the AGCM, companies must use Amazon&#39;s FBA service if they want access to key benefits like the Prime label, which in turn allows them to participate in Black Friday sales and other key events. &quot;Amazon has thus prevented third-party sellers from associating the Prime label with offers not managed with FBA,&quot; it said.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The authority said access to those functions are &quot;crucial&quot; for seller success. It also noted that third-party sellers using FBA are not subject to the same stringent performance requirements as non-FBA sellers. As such, they&#39;re less likely to be suspended from the platform if they fail to meet certain goals. Finally, it noted that sellers using Amazon&#39;s logistics services are discouraged from offering their products on other online platforms, at least to the same extent they do on Amazon.&nbsp;</p><p>The AGCM said it imposed the steep fine as it considered Amazon&#39;s actions to be &quot;particularly serious&quot; given  their duration and the effects they&#39;ve caused. On top of the fine, it has demanded that Amazon grant the privileges enjoyed by FBA sellers to all third-party sellers, provided they respect other rules and laws. It will have to define and publish those standards within a year, and its actions will be enforced by a monitoring trustee.</p><p>In a statement to Engadget, an Amazon spokesperson said the company &quot;strongly disagreed&quot; with the decision and will appeal. It also noted that non-FBA sellers can use its Seller Fulfilled Prime (SFP) service, which gives them access to Prime benefits without having to use Amazon’s logistics services.</p><blockquote><p>We strongly disagree with the decision of the Italian Competition Authority (ICA) and we will appeal. The proposed fine and remedies are unjustified and disproportionate. More than half of all annual sales on Amazon in Italy come from SMBs, and their success is at the heart of our business model. Small and medium-sized businesses have multiple channels to sell their products both online and offline: Amazon is just one of those options. We constantly invest to support the growth of the 18,000 Italian SMBs that sell on Amazon, and we provide multiple tools to our sellers, including those who manage shipments themselves.</p></blockquote><p>Last month, Amazon and Apple were <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-apple-fined-228-million-italy-restricting-beats-sales-123325114.html">fined $228 million</a> in Italy for unfairly restricting Beats sales by limiting them to select retailers.

Unfortunately for Mosseri, members of the subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security came to the hearing armed with fresh anecdotes from their own finstas.</p><p>During the hearing, Mosseri’s first time appearing in Congress, multiple senators revealed that they and their staffs had created fresh Instagram accounts disguised as teenagers. They all said that the app had steered them toward content that was inappropriate for young users, including “anorexia coaches,” and other content related to self harm.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The staff of one lawmaker, Tennessee Senator Marsha Blackburn, managed to uncover a significant bug in one of Instagram&#39;s teen safety features. Blackburn said that her staff created a fresh account as a 15-year old-girl, but that the account defaulted to public, not private. Instagram said <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-limit-targeted-ads-teens-130055774.html"><ins>in July</ins></a> that teens younger than 16 signing up for the first time would be defaulted to private accounts.</p><p>“While Instagram is touting all these safety measures, they aren&#39;t even making sure that the safety measures are in effect for me,” Blackburn said. Mosseri later confirmed that the company had mistakenly not enabled the private default settings for new accounts created on the web. “We will correct that quickly,” he said.</p><p>Blackburn wasn’t the only senator who came to the hearing prepared with questions about what they saw on a staff-created finsta. Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal said that his staff had created a new account posing as 13-year-old just days before. He said after following “a few accounts promoting eating disorders,” that “within an hour, all of our recommendations promoted pro-anorexia and eating disorder content.” He later added that a search for self harm content turned up results so graphic he didn’t feel he could describe them.</p><p>It was a notable shift from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-mental-health-senate-hearing-210317155.html"><ins>cringeworthy moment</ins></a> at a September hearing, when Blumenthal clumsily pushed Facebook’s Head of Safety, Antigone Davis, on whether she could “commit to ending finsta.” This time, Blumenthal pressed Mosseri on whether he would commit to ending work on Instagram Kids entirely — Mosseri did not — and whether he would make more data about Instagram’s algorithms available to researchers outside the company.</p><p>“I can commit to you today that we will provide meaningful access to data so that third party researchers can design their own studies and make their own conclusions about the effects of well being on young people,” Mosseri said. He later added that Instagram is working on giving users the option for a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-will-bring-back-a-chronological-feed-in-2022-211232214.html">chronological feed</a>.</p><p>Utah Senator Mike Lee also shared his experience creating an Instagram account for a fictitious 13-year-old girl. He described how the recommendations in the account’s Explore page changed after following just one account. “The Explore page yielded fairly benign results at first,” he said. “We followed the first account that was recommended by Instagram, which happened to be a very famous female celebrity. After following that account, we went back to the Explore page and the content quickly changed.</p><p>“Why did following Instagrams top recommended account for a 13-year-old girl cause our Explore page to go from showing really innocuous things, like hairstyling videos, to content that promotes body dysmorphia. sexualization of women and content otherwise unsuitable for a 13 year old girl?”</p><p>Mosseri replied that, according to the company’s Community Standards Enforcement report, content promoting eating disorders accounts for “roughly five out of every 10,000 things viewed.” Lee didn’t buy it. “It went dark fast,” he said. “It was not five in 1,000 or five in 10,000, it was rampant.”</p><p>While much of what the senators described was similar to what journalists and others have reported experiencing on Instagram, the exchanges were telling because they underscored a point that’s been raised by whistleblower Frances Haugen and others studying the company: That Facebook often uses <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebooks-deceptive-math-when-it-comes-to-hate-speech/"><ins>deceptive statistics</ins></a> to mask its problems. And that the sheer size of the platform means that even relatively low amounts of harmful content can have an outsize impact on users.&nbsp;</p><p>It also indicated just how seriously lawmakers are taking the issue of teen safety and social media. While previous hearings with big tech executives have often veered wildly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/congress-senate-section-230-hearing-predictable-195435541.html">off topic</a>, senators stayed relatively focused on the issues. And it was clear that there was bipartisan agreement on the need for Instagram to disclose more information about its platform to the public and to researchers.</p><p>“I would support federal legislation around the transparency of data, or the access to data from researchers, and around the prevalence of content problems on the platform,” Mosseri said. But Blumenthal pushed back, saying Instagram’s previous actions haven’t gone far enough.</p><p>“​​The kinds of baby steps that you&#39;ve suggested so far, very respectfully, are underwhelming,” Blumenthal said at the close of the hearing. “I think you will sense on this committee, pretty strong determination to do something well beyond what you&#39;ve indicated you have in mind. That&#39;s the reason that I think self-policing based on trust is no longer a viable solution.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/senate-hearing-instagram-adam-mosseri-001751448.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">92bc844d-10b4-4272-9e97-eaf8b0fa8e78</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 00:17:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639009072</ingested><modified>2021-12-09T00:18:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/fca7a240-5882-11ec-8677-40b30d1bfaf5" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/fca7a240-5882-11ec-8677-40b30d1bfaf5" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, USA - DECEMBER 08: Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri testifies at a Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security Subcommittee hearing on "Protecting Kids Online: Instagram and Reforms for Young Users" on Capitol Hill in Washington D.C., United States on December 08, 2021.

But if you end up being that unlucky soul, it turns out Twitter is prepared to help you survive the potential trolling onslaught. As <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-08/twitter-s-highest-profile-users-get-vip-treatment-when-trolls-strike"><em>Bloomberg reports</em></a>, the company has developed Project Guardian, an internal list of thousands of accounts who could potentially be attacked by other users. Being on that list fast-tracks any complaints related to those users on Twitter&#39;s moderation systems.</p><p>While it may sound a bit suspect, the big takeaway from <em>Bloomberg&#39;s</em> reporting is that Project Guardian is just a predictive aspect of Twitter&#39;s security measures. And unlike <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-vip-cross-check-xcheck-181720267.html">Facebook&#39;s treatment of VIP&#39;s</a>, which has been criticized for allowing celebrities and politicians to break that platform&#39;s rules, Twitter&#39;s system doesn&#39;t  necessarily grant more privileges to users.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Project Guardian also includes some well-known athletes, media personalities and politicians, but Yoel Roth, Twitter&#39;s head of site integrity, tells <em>Bloomberg</em> that the list doesn&#39;t include famous users. As, as we mentioned, it also helps to protect normal people who end up going viral.</p><p>“The reason this concept existed is because of the ‘person of the day’ phenomenon,” Roth said. “And on that basis, there are some people who are the ‘person of the day’ most days, and so Project Guardian would be one way to protect them.”</p><p>In an ideal world, Twitter would be able to give every user the same amount of security support. But, as <em>Bloomberg</em> notes, the company currently receives too many moderation requests to manage that. Perhaps that&#39;s an argument that user safety should be scaled in proportion with user growth. And while Project Guardian helps to protect some users, it&#39;s also a smart way for Twitter to squash harassment that could also hurt its own image. You could argue that&#39;s true for practically every security measure a social media company takes, though.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitter-project-guardian-vip-safety-220809710.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ff63f14e-c6c5-4444-bc1d-54b09cb4bc48</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 22:08:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639001291</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T22:08:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/d4ec5ef0-bf33-11eb-bbff-0def069971a4" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/d4ec5ef0-bf33-11eb-bbff-0def069971a4" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[In this photo illustration Twitter logo is displayed on a smartphone screen in Athens, Greece on April 14, 2021.

The organization, which is a coalition of labor unions, analyzed more than 130,000 search results and found that about 28 percent of the results you see on Amazon represent ads. What’s more, SOC says those ads don’t comply with FTC guidelines designed to make it possible for consumers to distinguish between sponsored content and organic search results.</p><p>In 2013, the agency <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/press-releases/ftc-consumer-protection-staff-updates-agencys-guidance-search-engine-industryon-need-distinguish/130625searchenginegeneralletter.pdf"><ins>said</ins></a> companies should feature prominent shading or borders, in addition to clear text that is properly situated and sized to avoid confusion. SOC found that zero percent of Amazon’s advertisements featured prominent shading and only about 1.1 percent had an easily distinguished border. When it came to the company’s use of “sponsored” labels, SOC found that in about 22 percent of ads the disclosure was buried under more prominent labels, such as ones that said “Highly rated” and “Today’s deals.” Additionally, those disclosures used a font that was smaller and lighter than the ones the company employed to advertise if a product was liked by other customers or part of a deal.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Elsewhere, SOC claims Amazon employs a technique called “lazy loading” where sponsored labels take longer to appear, particularly on slower internet connections. Using a 12 to 25Mbps connection, the organization found those labels could take up to three seconds longer to load than the top banner ad. We’ll note here we had difficulty verifying that claim at Engadget.</p><p>SOC has asked the FTC to take “aggressive and swift action” against the company. &quot;Amazon’s violations are so omnipresent that Amazon’s representation that its platform presents ‘search results’ to consumers is itself deceptive,&quot; it said.</p><p>Amazon disputes SOC&#39;s findings. “This report is incorrect and misunderstands FTC guidance – ads in Amazon’s store always include a clear and prominent ‘sponsored’ label, implemented in accordance with FTC guidelines,” an Amazon spokesperson told Engadget. “We design our store to help customers discover products we think may best meet their needs – sponsored ads is one of the ways to help them find products they may be interested in.”</p><p>It’s hard to say if the FTC will take up SOC’s complaint against Amazon. And, even if it does, what kind of action it could take against the company. Part of the problem here is that the agency’s own guidelines leave some room open for interpretation.</p><p>“We understand that there is not any one specific method for clearly and prominently distinguishing advertising from natural search results, and that search engines may develop new methods for distinguishing advertising results,” the FTC said in 2013. “Any method may be used, so long as it is noticeable and understandable to consumers.”</p><p>At the same time, this is exactly the kind of issue the agency is likely willing to take up under recently appointed chair <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lina-khan-ftc-confirmation-antitrust-big-tech-183254782.html"><ins>Lina Khan</ins></a>. In 2017, Khan, then a student at Yale Law School, published an article titled “<a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox"><ins>Amazon&#39;s Antitrust Paradox</ins></a>” in which she argued current US policies and laws weren’t enough to keep companies like Amazon accountable.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/soc-ftc-amazon-complaint-220745342.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">955117b1-cf95-48d7-9fe1-6b0948c38449</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 22:07:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639000676</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T21:58:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3be54ca0-586f-11ec-bffe-ca4c77dfad91" width="4989" height="3325" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3be54ca0-586f-11ec-bffe-ca4c77dfad91" width="4989" height="3325" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Gonzalo Fuentes / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The logo of Amazon is seen at the company's logistics center in Bretigny-sur-Orge, near Paris, France, December 7, 2021.

President Biden has <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/12/08/executive-order-on-catalyzing-clean-energy-industries-and-jobs-through-federal-sustainability/">issued</a> an executive order that would require the government to stop buying combustion engine vehicles by 2035, and to switch all buildings to renewables and other zero-carbon energy sources by 2050. The administration willbuy only carbon-free electricity by 2030, and aims to cut building emissions in half by 2032.</p><p>Biden saw the measure as a way to &quot;lead by example&quot; and encourage both a &quot;carbon pollution-free&quot; electricity industry by 2035 and net zero emissions for the entire economy by 2050. The federal government is the largest employer, energy user and land owner in the US, the President said, and its shift to renewables could influence private businesses.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s a modest goal in some ways. The timeline is very long, for a start. Multiple states will have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-york-law-ban-gas-powered-car-sales-2035-053554406.html">banned gas-powered car sales</a> by 2035 — why would it take the federal government that long to switch a relatively modest 600,000-vehicle fleet to EVs and other emissions-free machines? The 300,000 buildings are more daunting, but the order gives officials roughly three decades to make the transition.</p><p>At the same time, there are plenty of challenges. The feds depend on a wide range of buildings and vehicles across the country, many of them with different requirements. It may take a highly coordinated effort to transition everything to zero-emissions transport and renewable energy, even if the scale is relatively modest. And then there&#39;s the question of future administrations. As we&#39;ve seen before, a new presidency can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-03-trump-epa-dot-fuel-emissions-proposal.html">undo environmental regulations</a> and delay or even thwart emissions reduction plans. The targets offer plenty of opportunities for reversals.</p><p>The order is still notable even if there are setbacks. It&#39;s an acknowledgment that efforts to limit climate change aren&#39;t confined to the private sector, and it could prompt contractors to transition to environmentally friendly products in a bid to win federal deals.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/biden-federal-building-vehicle-renewable-energy-order-215237418.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">58301b6c-ff75-450d-876e-2a9ccce0294c</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 21:52:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639000989</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T22:03:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Climate Change]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/2043a570-5868-11ec-bbdf-93cc2c968f98" width="2880" height="1920" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/2043a570-5868-11ec-bbdf-93cc2c968f98" width="2880" height="1920" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[MANDEL NGAN via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[GMC Hummer EVs are seen behind President Joe Biden as he speaks during a visit to the General Motors Factory ZERO electric vehicle assembly plant in Detroit, Michigan on November 17, 2021.

Christine works for Blizzard, the group responsible for games including Overwatch and Diablo, and she stood outside the studio&#39;s headquarters in Irvine, California, with her lawyer, Lisa Bloom, by her side.&nbsp;</p><p>Through tears, Christine said she experienced years of sexual harassment at Blizzard, even though it had started out as her &quot;dream job.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;I was so excited to be a part of a community that seemed to care so much about their employees,&quot; Christine said. &quot;Unfortunately, that didn&#39;t happen to me. Since I&#39;ve been employed at Blizzard, I&#39;ve been subjected to rude comments about my body, unwanted sexual advances, inappropriately touched, subjected to alcohol-infused team events and cube crawls, invited to have casual sex with my supervisors, and surrounded by a frat-boy culture that&#39;s detrimental to women.&quot;</p><p>Christine said she brought these negative experiences to her supervisors and they were brushed aside. According to her statement, her superiors said the men harassing her were &quot;just joking&quot; and that she should &quot;get over it.&quot; She was told not to go to HR. She was told her abusers had done nothing wrong in the eyes of the law.</p><p>Christine said that after she complained about the sexual abuse she was experiencing, she was demoted and faced retaliation. She said she was denied shares in the company and full profit-sharing, and she received minimal raises.</p><p>In her statement, Christine said her mental health was shattered by these events, but she was going public in order to fight for a safe work environment for all Activision Blizzard employees.</p><p>&quot;Blizzard has some amazing people that work for them, but we need to feel safe and supported by people in leadership roles, and hold people accountable for their actions,&quot; she said.</p><p>Activision Blizzard is facing multiple investigations and lawsuits regarding its alleged frat-boy culture. The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing is suing the studio after an investigation uncovered years of discriminatory hiring practices, a systemic failure to treat sexual harassment seriously, and a culture that encouraged abuse. The result, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-discrimination-abuse-video-163056567.html">according to the DFEH report</a>, was a studio where just 20 percent of employees were women, and leadership roles were held only by white men.</p><div id="59bef0775e084ab1be8831373bb64b6a"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/we5QWDLHwXE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Lisa Bloom, Christine&#39;s lawyer, made a statement of her own after the employee spoke.</p><p>&quot;We are here because sexual harassment victims at Activision Blizzard have been ignored,&quot; Bloom said. &quot;They are still suffering and it&#39;s time that they are prioritized.&quot;</p><p>Following an investigation by the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission earlier this year, Activision Blizzard was ordered to establish an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-settles-eeoc-18-million-lawsuit-005806200.html">$18 million fund</a> to compensate victims of sexual harassment and gender discrimination at the studio. Bloom argued that this amount is far too low, considering there are hundreds of victims. She also pointed out that Activision Blizzard has already missed critical deadlines when it comes to distributing this money.</p><p>&quot;I think we can all agree that the $18 million number is woefully inadequate,&quot; Bloom said.</p><p>Bloom then outlined three demands. She first said Activision Blizzard should establish a streamlined, fair and fast process for all victims to resolve their legal claims, and asked for a fund exceeding $100 million. Second, Bloom said the studio should deliver a real apology to Christine and the other victims, and third, she demanded a review by a neutral third party of the career damage employees like Christine have endured, with the goal of remedying any discriminatory decisions.</p><p>Bloom has ample experience in this legal arena, most recently representing victims of Jeffrey Epstein.</p><div id="ffa454670ad44f96a21be05b87136940"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JMof6sI_fks?rel=0&amp;start=4232" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Activision Blizzard employees have staged a handful of walkouts in protest of the studio&#39;s response to these allegations, which has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-employee-open-letter-221223475.html">dismissive </a>and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/blizzard-boss-jen-oneal-was-paid-less-than-her-male-counterpart-prior-to-resigning/">generally terrible</a>.

In response, roboticists have developed a number of solutions, from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhpMlI8jb5o">installing rotors so that the robot can helicopter over obstacles</a> or, in Boston Dynamics case, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/boston-dynamics-atlas-robots-parkour-demo-141057531.html">execute backflips</a> that would give Simone Biles pause. And then there&#39;s Daniele Pucci, head of the Artificial and Mechanical Intelligence lab at the Italian Institute of Technology, who has taken the audacious step of strapping a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gravity-industries-jet-suit-test-impressions-future-lab-festival-of-speed-160009551.html">fully functional jetpack</a> akin to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-taking-on-gravity-richard-browning-penguin-random-house-uk-153026035.html">what Richard Browning developed</a> onto the back of an iRonCub synthetic humanoid with hopes of eventually <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/flying-humanoid-robot">blasting it into the sky</a>.</p><div id="45e54b4708994a829af00f8ac2fbc960"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NShdgh16Yuk?rel=0&amp;start=1" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>You&#39;d think we&#39;d have learned our lesson about the dangers of building aerial humanoid robots after our first time through <em>Age of Ultron </em>but Pucci&#39;s team believes that such systems could one day act as first responders to the roughly 300 natural disasters that kill around 90,000 people worldwide annually. We&#39;ve seen a slew of disaster response bots — some <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-06-08-the-machines-that-rose-to-darpas-robotics-challenge.html">humanoid</a>, some <a href="https://www.engadget.com/carnegie-mellon-snake-robot-swims-181159998.html">not so much</a> — <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-19-darpas-insect-sized-shrimp-robots-disaster-relief.html">emerge from labs</a> for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2009-03-04-researchers-develop-flying-wifi-robots-for-disaster-relief.html">more than a decade</a>, often with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-06-08-the-machines-that-rose-to-darpas-robotics-challenge.html">varying degrees of success</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="c6024084680b4162becaa7ba0e696be6"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g0TaYhjpOfo?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Humanoid robots have an advantage over both more esoteric builds and traditional UAVs when it comes to disaster response because they can more easily manipulate a world, which is already designed for human use. However when a natural disaster strikes, much of that human-centric infrastructure could become damaged or otherwise rendered impassable, which negates many of the humanoid robot&#39;s initial advantages. But by combining a humanoid design with the capability of flight, Pucci&#39;s team can leverage the best aspects of both technologies.</p><p>&quot;Aerial Humanoid Robotics unifies aerial manipulation and humanoid robotics. By doing so, aerial humanoid robots overcome the lack of terrestrial locomotion of aerial manipulators and extend the locomotion capabilities of humanoid robots to the flight case. Aerial humanoid robots can then walk, fly, manipulate and transport objects, thus offering energetically efficient solutions to payload transportation and object manipulation,&quot; <a href="https://ieee-aerialrobotics-uavs.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ICRA2019_AerialRoboticsWorkshop_paper_Pucci.pdf">the IIT team wrote in 2019</a>.</p><div id="a7403dcb4b4d4d9c99810a3984a39a5f"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hBEYEF0g4WY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>&quot;Aerial humanoid robotics extends aerial manipulation to a more robust and energy efficient level. In fact, aerial manipulation is often exemplified by quadrotors equipped with a robotic arm,&quot; Pucci told <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/flying-humanoid-robot"><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></a><em>.</em> &quot;These robots can’t move around by means of contact forces with the environment, and they often struggle with flying in windy environments while manipulating an object, requiring precise position control for accomplishing manipulation tasks. So the extra hand of a flying humanoid robot could establish a contact point between the robot and the environment, thus making the robot position control simpler and more robust.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I truly believe that aerial humanoid robotics can be used as a test-bed for actuated flying exoskeletons for human beings,&quot; he continued. &quot;The recent successful story of Richard Browning shows the engineering feasibility of these futuristic actuated exoskeletons. However, the journey in front of us is still long, and we can use flying humanoid robots to boost this journey and avoid lots of tests on humans.&quot;</p><p>Pucci&#39;s most recent study, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9622189"><em>Momentum-Based Extended Kalman Filter for Thrust Estimation on Flying Multibody Robots</em></a>, is slated for publication in the January issue of <em>IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/italian-researchers-have-built-a-humanoid-robot-that-may-one-day-fly-like-iron-man-192750759.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4a44e215-1a15-4ca1-b2b8-dfd61b153f82</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 19:27:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638993555</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T19:59:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/60c3d330-585a-11ec-b7fe-107d7a4abd05" width="1580" height="1185" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/43792c60-5852-11ec-86f9-ce870507a0c0" width="2880" height="1576" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Instituto Italiano di Technologia]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iRonCub as iRonMan]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iRonCub as iRonMan]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Horizon Zero Dawn' now supports NVIDIA and AMD upscaling on PC]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Guerrilla Games has rolled out the latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Horizon%20Zero%20Dawn/"><em><ins>Horizon Zero Dawn</ins></em></a> update on PC, which should improve the game&#39;s performance.

What’s more, if your device starts running low on battery life and enters Power Reserve mode, you can still use your iPhone or Apple Watch as a keycard for up to five hours.</p><p>The six locations where you can use your iPhone or Apple Watch to store a keycard are as follows: Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort, Hyatt Centric Key West Resort and Spa, Hyatt House Chicago/West Loop-Fulton Market, Hyatt House Dallas/Richardson, Hyatt Place Fremont/Silicon Valley and Hyatt Regency Long Beach.</p><p>Hyatt says it expects to roll out the technology to all of its locations globally. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-wallet-digital-id-delay-195046762.html">Sometime next year</a>, Apple also plans to allow iOS 15 and watchOS 8 to store government issued IDs from select states as well.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-wallet-hotel-keycards-hyatt-launch-190013202.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9cf0798a-0b23-4144-aec8-c82207f5eeb4</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 19:00:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638992106</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T19:35:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Travel & Tourism]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/5d0536d0-5855-11ec-bbe4-0bcb4305d433" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/5d0536d0-5855-11ec-bbe4-0bcb4305d433" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Hyatt Hotels Corporation]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple Wallet hotel keys]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Wallet hotel keys]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Ford Bronco Sport contains trace amounts of recycled ocean plastic]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Many car brands are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-polestar-2-is-a-sporty-ev-fastback-with-allnew-android-automotive-140040133.html">touting recycled parts</a> in their vehicles, but Ford thinks it can claim some extra bragging rights. The badge <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/12/08/ford-bronco-sport-recycled-ocean-plastic.html">claims</a> the Bronco Sport is the first vehicle to use parts made entirely of recycled ocean plastic. Ford used plastic from the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean to make wireless harness clips in the SUV. They&#39;re as durable as previous petroleum-based clips, but require less energy to make and even cost 10 percent less.</p><p>The company has been using some degree of recycled plastic for over two decades, although it has been getting creative as of late. It recently started making F-250 fuel-line clips <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-hp-3d-injection-molded-part-3d-printer-waste-204612676.html">from 3D printer waste</a>, and used water bottles for the underbody shields on the 2020 Escape.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This move could be an important step toward more sustainable car production. At the same time, it shows just how far Ford has to go. They&#39;re small parts in an SUV that&#39;s sold exclusively with a combustion engine inside — this would carry more weight if they were larger components in a hybrid or pure electric vehicle. Ford has vowed to further <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-will-only-sell-electrified-vehicles-in-europe-by-2030-113015462.html">electrify its lineup</a> and explore future uses of ocean plastic. Until that happens, though, this is more a hint of that future than a major milestone.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ford-bronco-sport-recycled-ocean-plastic-parts-184616958.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ac9d0db3-4aef-4a57-b242-a57f269914cd</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 18:46:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638989190</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T18:46:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Conservation & Recycling]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b4fabfd0-5851-11ec-9dee-37ea3ba4d49b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b4fabfd0-5851-11ec-9dee-37ea3ba4d49b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ford]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[2022 Ford Bronco Sport]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[2022 Ford Bronco Sport]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[iOS 15.2 will help you spot third-party iPhone parts]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-user-iphone-repair-policy-change-173047862.html">seeming about-face on repairability</a> will soon help you spot less-than-honest iPhone repair shops and part sellers. As <em>Gizmodo</em><a href="https://gizmodo.com/apples-new-ios-feature-could-warn-you-of-repair-shop-sc-1848179239">notes</a>, Apple has <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212878">revealed</a> iOS 15.2&#39;s settings will include a &quot;parts and service history&quot; section (under General &gt; About) that indicates not only whether the battery, camera and display have been replaced, but will indicate whether or not they&#39;re officially sanctioned Apple parts. If a component is listed as an &quot;unknown part,&quot; it&#39;s either unofficial, an already-used part from another iPhone or malfunctioning.</p><p>Just how much you&#39;ll learn depends on your iPhone model. Anyone using an iPhone XR, XS or second-generation <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-se-review-2020-cheap-a13-bionic-399-130014174.html">iPhone SE</a> can only tell if the battery has been replaced. You&#39;ll need an iPhone 11 or newer to also find out if there&#39;s a display swap, and an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-12-12-pro-review-cameras-5g-performance-price-214630744.html">iPhone 12</a> or later to know if the camera has been replaced. Apple stressed that these alerts won&#39;t prevent you from using your device — you&#39;re fine if you&#39;re comfortable using unofficial parts and losing warranty coverage.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>iOS 15.2 currently exists as a release candidate for developers, suggesting the finished version will be available relatively soon. It&#39;s not yet clear if iPad owners will see a corresponding part history feature at some point.</p><p>The &quot;unknown part&quot; label might not thrill advocates for third-party component options. Apple clearly wants you to use official parts, and that means either taking it in for authorized service or (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-self-service-repair-iphone-mac-142122774.html">in 2022</a>) buying parts from Apple. This might help you catch shops lying about the quality of their parts, though, and could be useful if you repair an iPhone yourself and want to be sure your fixes went smoothly.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-ios-15-2-genuine-repair-parts-174546070.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">df0c8187-af16-4774-ae0b-b8cb86e61af3</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 17:45:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638985550</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T17:46:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/9213c0a0-1ed8-11ec-a7fd-a6bf9eb4f536" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/9213c0a0-1ed8-11ec-a7fd-a6bf9eb4f536" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 13 Pro in gold — back view]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 13 Pro in gold — back view]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
