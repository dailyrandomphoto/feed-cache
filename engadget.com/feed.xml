It&#39;s meant to standardize voice assistant support across multiple devices, as well as to make it easier to connect smart home gadgets to your home network. During its Alexa Live developer presentation, Amazon said that practically every plug-in Echo speaker will support Matter, save for the first-generation Echo, Echo Dot and Echo Tap, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586377/amazon-echo-matter-standard-dot-show-studio-flex-plus-upgrade"><em>The Verge reports</em></a>.</p><p>It&#39;s unclear when the Echo support will actually arrive, but at this point we&#39;re expecting Matter devices to launch later this year.

Until today, you had to go outside of the app to understand what those messages were communicating. Not any more. Instagram has introduced a new feature that will translate any foreign text you see in Stories, and that feature is now rolling out to users across the globe.</p><p>When the app detects you’re viewing a Story in another language, it will display a “See Translation” prompt toward the top left of the interface. All you have to do is tap the banner to see the text in your native tongue. With today’s launch, the feature can translate text between more than 90 languages — though it doesn’t work with audio at the moment. Inevitably that means they’ll be Stories where you might not understand what someone is saying. Still, it’s a step toward making Instagram as inclusive as possible. People can also take advantage of Instagram’s recently added <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-stories-captions-172051963.html">auto-captioning feature</a> to get around the current translation limitation.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/instagram-translate-text-stories-160008406.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7e52027e-5617-4948-b087-93f07e44282c</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 16:00:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626880589</ingested><modified>2021-07-21T15:16:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/64ffbce0-ea35-11eb-a5fc-5caa58c543d2" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/64ffbce0-ea35-11eb-a5fc-5caa58c543d2" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Instagram]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Instagram Stories translation]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Instagram Stories translation]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Epic Games buys 3D asset platform Sketchfab]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/epic%20games"><ins>Epic Games</ins></a> seems determined to give developers everything they need to make games in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tribeca-epic-games-unreal-engine-workshops-indie-filmmakers-182840472.html"><ins>Unreal Engine</ins></a> without having to look elsewhere for parts.

That&#39;s what I&#39;m wondering after seeing the company&#39;s next batch of titles: <em>Claymates</em>, <em>Jelly Boy</em> and <em>Bombuzal, </em>which are scheduled to arrive on July 28th. No offense to Interplay&#39;s <em>Clay</em> series (which includes the far more memorable <em>Clayfighter</em>), but these aren&#39;t titles I&#39;m exactly hankering to dive into. While Nintendo has done a solid job of bringing some of the biggest first-party titles over to Switch Online&#39;s SNES library, we&#39;re still waiting for classics like <em>Mario RPG</em> and <em>EarthBound </em>to arrive.&nbsp;</p><div id="ccb523425e5546119b44e348e1e407fd"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/etAN0o4LVT0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>There&#39;s some value in letting younger generations see the sort of titles &#39;90s kids had to suffer through, though.

But they tend to leave out the part where you’re scrounging every dollar for textbooks, food and (if you’re lucky) the occasional weekend outing with friends. Money is tight when you’re a student, and that financial stress can be compounded by the reality of having to stay on top of your studies.</p><p>If there’s a silver lining, it’s student discounts. Many companies offer their products and services for less to those struggling through lectures, writing research papers and studying for finals. We’ve compiled a list of the best deals you can get on useful services, along with some things you’ll enjoy in your down time. Just keep in mind that most of these offers require you to prove your status as a student either by signing up with your .edu email address or providing some form of student identification.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Shopping</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/cb687390-df50-11eb-bf6f-1b79061e9ed1" data-uuid=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3>Amazon Prime Student</h3><p>If you’re not piggybacking off of your parents’ Amazon Prime account, you can have the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:subscription" href="https://amzn.to/3wTJAgn">subscription</a> for less while you’re in school. College students can get Prime Student for $6.50 per month or $60 per year, and it includes the same perks as a standard Prime membership including free two-day shipping, free same-day delivery in select areas, and access to the entire Prime Video library. Amazon also currently offers a six-month free trial, so you’ll pay even less during your first year.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Prime Student at Amazon - $60/year" href="https://amzn.to/3wTJAgn">Buy Prime Student at Amazon - $60 a year</a></p><h3>Best Buy</h3><p>While it doesn’t offer a specific student discount, Best Buy has <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Student Deals" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/QOJQmx">Student Deals</a> that you can sign up to receive. Aside from proving your student status, the only requirement is for you to be a My Best Buy member; that program is free to enroll in. We actually recommend that most people sign up for My Best Buy because some items, especially during site-wide sales, will be even cheaper for members. All student deals will appear in the Member Offers page in your account.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Sign up for Student Deals at Best Buy" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/QOJQmx">Sign up for Student Deals at Best Buy</a></p><h3>Apple</h3><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:other;pdid:Apple" href="https://www.apple.com/us-hed/shop/back-to-school">Apple</a> offers some deals to students and educators. This year in particular, Apple is throwing in a free pair of AirPods when you buy select Macs or iPads for college. You’ll get AirPods with the regular wired charging case free, or you can upgrade to AirPods with the wireless charging case for $40 more. Alternatively, you can get the AirPods Pro for $90 more. Apple knows how popular AirPods are and it clearly wants to sweeten the deal for students who have been thinking about getting a new computer before heading off to college.</p><p>The AirPods promotion also includes Apple education pricing on Macs and iPads. There isn’t a flat percentage rate across all products; the discounts are device dependent. For example, right now students can get a new MacBook Air M1 starting at $899, which is $100 less than the normal starting price (Amazon&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:matching this price" href="https://amzn.to/3zkFsqZ">matching this price</a>, too). The 13-inch MacBook Pro also starts off $100 cheaper and the new iPad Pros start at $749, or $50 cheaper than usual. These are decent savings if you must have a brand new Apple product, but those with tighter budgets should also consider Apple’s refurb program.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:other;pdid:Shop Apple&#x002019;s back-to-school promos" href="https://www.apple.com/us-hed/shop/back-to-school">Shop Apple’s back-to-school promos</a></p><h3>Samsung</h3><p>Samsung offers up to <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:10 percent off" href="https://fave.co/3peP9na">10 percent off</a> most of its products to students and educators. The brand also has some decent offers like a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:" href="https://fave.co/3iB3E1s">&quot;speed and storage&quot; bundle</a> that includes two Samsung drives for under $300. We’d recommend stretching that 10 percent discount as much as possible by using it on big-ticket items like a Samsung laptop or a Galaxy smartphone if you need one. Otherwise, Samsung has solid accessories like the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Galaxy SmartTag" href="https://fave.co/3dxyHtO">Galaxy SmartTag</a> and the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Galaxy Watch Active 2" href="https://fave.co/3BB6SLo">Galaxy Watch Active 2</a>.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Shop Samsung&#x002019;s back-to-school promos" href="https://fave.co/3peP9na">Shop Samsung’s back-to-school promos</a></p><h3>Microsoft</h3><p>Microsoft also provides students and educators with up to <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:10 percent off" href="https://fave.co/3vPkijy">10 percent off</a> its gadgets, including the already affordable Surface Go 2 and the Surface Headphones 2.

Besides access to millions of songs, it also includes Hulu’s ad-supported plan and Showtime’s ad-free service. You’d spend roughly $27 a month if you paid for all three separately at their full prices, making this student offer one of the best you can get.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:other;pdid:Buy Spotify Premium Student - $5/month" href="https://www.spotify.com/us/student/">Buy Spotify Premium Student - $5 a month</a></p><h3>Pandora</h3><p>Pandora also offers students its <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:other;pdid:Premium membership" href="https://www.pandora.com/upgrade/premium/student">Premium membership</a> for $5 per month. Pandora’s offering doesn’t include any additional services, but you do get an ad-free experience, personalized music, unlimited skips and unlimited offline play.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:other;pdid:Buy Pandora Premium Student- $5/month" href="https://www.pandora.com/upgrade/premium/student">Buy Pandora Premium Student- $5 a month</a></p><h3>Apple Music</h3><p>Apple also slashes 50 percent off its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205928">Apple Music</a> subscription for students, bringing it down to $5 per month. The offer is available for up to 48 months so you can enjoy the rate for the entirety of your college experience. What’s more, the company bundles Apple TV+ in this student offer, so you can watch Apple originals like The Morning Show and See.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:other;pdid:Buy Apple Music Student membership - $5/month" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205928">Buy Apple Music Student membership - $5 a month</a></p><h3>Tidal</h3><p>Tidal provides <a href="https://support.tidal.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002669818-Student-Discount">student discounts</a> on both of its streaming services: Premium and Hi-Fi. Premium drops to $5 per month, down from $10, while Hi-Fi costs $10 per month, down from $20. This year, the company is offering a <a href="https://fave.co/2USwiTW">three-month free trial</a> of either of its services to any new user through the end of August. Tidal is still often overshadowed by Spotify and Apple Music, but these discounts are a good way to give it a try without spending too much money.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:other;pdid:Buy Tidal Student starting at $10/month" href="https://support.tidal.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002669818-Student-Discount">Buy Tidal Student starting at $10 a month</a></p><h3>Hulu</h3><p>College students can sign up for <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Hulu&#x002019;s ad-supported plan" href="https://fave.co/3pgvrHu">Hulu’s ad-supported plan</a> for only $2 per month. That’s $4 less than the normal price and a great deal considering all of the content that Hulu has to offer (think <em>The Handmaid’s Tale, Grey’s Anatomy, Rick &amp; Morty</em> and more). Yes, you have to deal with commercials, but it’s a small price to pay to binge-watch shows like <em>Brooklyn Nine Nine,</em> which can provide a much-needed laugh when you’re drowning in coursework.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy Hulu (ad-supported) - $2/month" href="https://fave.co/3pgvrHu">Buy Hulu (ad-supported) - $2 a month</a></p><h3>YouTube</h3><p>If you’re already spending a lot of time watching YouTube, you may have a better experience with YouTube Premium. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/premium/student">The Student plan</a> knocks nearly 50 percent off the price so you’ll pay $7 per month for ad-free video viewing, background play, video downloads and access to YouTube Premium Music. The latter is YouTube’s attempt at a Spotify/Apple Music competitor, but it has a long way to go before it can really hold a candle to those services. However, if you listen to most of your music via YouTube already, Premium could be your one-stop-shop for music and video streaming.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:other;pdid:Buy YouTube Premium Student - $7/month" href="https://www.youtube.com/premium/student">Buy YouTube Premium Student - $7 a month</a></p><h3>Headspace</h3><p>Being a student is stressful even in the best of times, but now it’s even more difficult to concentrate and find peace. <a href="https://www.headspace.com/studentplan">Headspace</a> is just one of many meditation and mindfulness apps available that can help with that, but it stands apart with a great student discount: $10 for the entire year, or $60 less than a normal annual membership. In addition to a large library of meditation lessons and routines to follow, Headspace recently added SleepCasts, a collection of soothing voices reading bedtime stories to help you fall asleep, as well as “mindful” workout routines.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:other;pdid:Buy Headspace Student plan - $10/year" href="https://www.headspace.com/studentplan">Buy Headspace Student plan - $10 a year</a></p><h2>Tools</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/cb67d750-df50-11eb-abff-6e8b2b38d1cd" data-uuid=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3>Adobe Creative Cloud</h3><p>You’re probably using <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:Adobe products" href="https://bit.ly/34NfsaF">Adobe products</a> if you’re studying anything to do with digital art or design. Adobe CC is the industry standard in this space but the entire suite of programs is quite expensive at $53 per month. Thankfully, Adobe has education pricing for students that drops the entire creative suite to $20 per month for the first year. That includes the big programs like Photoshop CC and Illustrator CC along with Lightroom CC, Premiere Pro CC, Adobe XD and more.</p><p>After your first year, the monthly cost increases to $30 per month.

Like, <em>really</em>.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/aliens-fireteam-cold-iron-announcement-online-shooter-150024353.html"><em>Aliens: Fireteam Elite</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>is an online, co-op, third-person survival shooter from Cold Iron Studios, and it’s been in development for the past six years. Cold Iron was actually bought and sold four times starting in 2018, bringing its mysterious Alien-based game along for the ride. In the end, Cold Iron has cut a deal with 20th Century Studios to self-publish <em>Aliens: Fireteam Elite</em>, and it’s due to hit Steam, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series consoles on August 24th, priced at $40.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3d7b5d30-e9a6-11eb-b556-e013e611f324" alt="Aliens: Fireteam Elite" data-uuid="d24fe6dd-afdf-30d2-ad05-ad97cd1ee80b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">20th Century Studios</div></figure><p>I had the chance to play a preview build of <em>Fireteam Elite</em> that included access to two of the four campaigns, and four of the five character classes: gunner, technician, demolisher and doc (the final class is recon). Each campaign consists of three missions filled with AI-powered Xenomorph hordes, with three difficulty levels unlocked from the start. Every mission requires three players, and empty team slots are filled by bots named Alpha and Beta, which honestly end up functioning more like mobile turrets than actual teammates.</p><p>So, after playing hours of the preview with friends and bots alike, here’s my conclusion: <em>Aliens: Fireteam Elite</em> is a generic survival shooter with old-school arcade DNA. <em>Fireteam Elite</em> feels like an online, updated version of light-gun games like <em>Area 51</em> or <em>House of the Dead</em>, complete with repetitive environments and sloppy hit boxes. The game is competent, but not dynamic. To put it simply — man, it’s <em>just </em>a shooting gallery down there.</p><p>To be fair, that’s what survival shooters are all about. Enter a new area, prepare your defenses, kill the swarm, rinse and repeat. The thing is, <em>Fireteam Elite</em> deploys this formula in such a rigid structure that missions quickly become predictable, no matter how many bugs show up. What’s more, the generic sci-fi environments blend together after a few playthroughs, and tricks like falling ceiling panels and sudden bursts of steam lose their effectiveness well before the first mission is over.</p><section data-eng-breakout="6eb7a0c029074a3780b16f9ce49e0a51" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3d7a72d1-e9a6-11eb-b791-6b6592190957" alt="Aliens: Fireteam Elite"></section><p><em>Fireteam Elite</em> fails to build tension. With such a transparent gameplay structure, any feeling of pressure or horror has to come from the xenomorphs themselves, and frankly, they’re often not smart enough to make this happen. The swarms rarely feel unmanageable and the specialized xenomorphs, like spitters or jumpers, routinely behave in non-threatening ways. This unpredictability ends up being more adorable than scary. Plus, I have to note that my game crashed three times in about seven hours of play.</p><p>That’s not to say the AI is trash altogether. Cold Iron says it’s already resolved some of the movement issues the xenomorphs were experiencing in the preview build, and it really is impressive to see dozens of inky black aliens bounding down the hallway, each on its own path but out for blood, and the game is built around these moments. The xenos stumble around corners like dogs on a tile floor, and details like this add much-needed personality to the waves.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/a8e4f270-7ae8-11eb-b97f-c1ae18e3ae0b" alt="Aliens: Fireteam Elite" data-uuid="721e2881-005d-307a-9d13-35e488a4b2a8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">20th Century Studios</div></figure><p>The game’s most exciting moments come at the end of each mission, during the final swarm. These are long standoffs with waves of xenomorphs, including spitters, prowlers, bursters and giants that hunt down a single crew member at a time. I’ve found the technician and doc to be particularly useful in these moments — the technician has a turret that recharges after it’s been destroyed and shock grenades to keep the xenomorphs at bay, while the doc has an incredibly handy healing circle.</p><p>This is where the most strategizing takes place, even if it is mostly just turret talk. There are chests containing consumable weapons, health and on-demand ammo refills at each final battle, meaning your whole team will start off well-equipped and they’re free to spray and pray. This is good, considering the reticles on most of the weapons are generous, and crowd control is the name of the game, not accuracy.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/a8e4f271-7ae8-11eb-bf7f-d3069f06eed0" alt="Aliens: Fireteam Elite" data-uuid="bf2d1cc1-ba96-3faa-9f88-c9d2c8b897e2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">20th Century Studios</div></figure><p>There are a few bright spots in <em>Aliens: Fireteam Elite</em>. The soundtrack is a James Horner-inspired orchestral situation and it’s a constant reminder of the game’s cinematic 1980s roots; it does a lot of heavy lifting when it comes to setting the mood. Plus, the game’s RPG elements — including character, loadout and weapon customization, and challenge cards — add a necessary layer of depth to otherwise straightforward missions.</p><p>I wasn’t expecting <em>Fireteam Elite</em> to be as narrative-driven as the films or as moody as <em>Alien: Isolation</em>, but I had hoped for something like Left 4 Dead meets Dead Space, and this ain’t that. Instead, <em>Aliens: Fireteam Elite </em>feels like a theme park ride in video game form. The monsters aren’t really threatening, but the crowds certainly are.

Despite <a href="https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/host-city-tokyo-enters-fresh-coronavirus-emergency-games-near-2021-07-12/"><ins>Japan’s struggles</ins></a> to contain the virus and <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/tokyo-olympics-live-updates/2021/07/19/1018045639/despite-positive-covid-cases-team-usa-ceo-says-athletes-are-ready-to-compete"><ins>athletes testing positive</ins></a> inside the Olympic Village, the event is still on. The sheer amount of action happening every day through the first week of August means you’ll need to plan ahead to catch all of the events you want to see, especially if you’re on the opposite side of the world.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2><strong>When do the Olympics start?</strong></h2><p>The official start to the Olympics is the opening ceremony on Friday, July 23rd at 7AM ET, but a few events will actually kick off before that. Softball and Women’s Soccer competition begins Wednesday (Tokyo time), but the first games aired Tuesday night on the east coast. Softball, Men’s Soccer and Rowing are set to take place on Thursday with Rowing, Cycling, Tennis and Women’s Water Polo scheduled after the Opening Ceremony Friday and into Saturday. This weekend is when things really get going though, with a packed slate of events from Saturday onward. The closing ceremony will air at 8PM ET on NBC on Sunday, August 8th.</p><h2><strong>How to watch</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/726fb050-e9a5-11eb-8bad-72b3410bdb23" style="height:2534;width:3801;" alt="Jul 5, 2021; East Hartford, Connecticut, USA; The United States midfielder Sam Mewis (3) in action defended against Mexico midfielder Nancy Antonio (16) during the first half during a USWNT Send-off Series soccer match at Pratt &amp; Whitney Stadium.

The network’s current deal goes through 2032, so you won’t have to look around to find the games on new channels anytime soon. Due to the volume of events, NBC proper isn’t enough to show all of the action, so you can also find live coverage on NBCSN, USA, CNBC, Golf Channel and the Olympic Channel — cable or TV streaming subscription required. Following controversy over tape delays during previous Olympics, NBC began airing events live in 2012 despite the massive time differences. During prime time in the US, the network will show highlights from earlier in the day in addition to any live action.</p><p>At least a portion of the marquee events — including the opening/closing ceremonies, Women’s Soccer Final, Basketball, Track &amp; Field — will air on NBC. A lot of the events that take place in the middle of the night Eastern time (which is the bulk of the action) will be shown on the other networks and <a href="https://fave.co/3cesCla"><ins>NBC’s streaming service Peacock</ins></a>. NBC Sports announced that Peacock will be home to “major events live each morning” including Women’s and Men’s Gymnastics, Track &amp; Field and Basketball. The streaming service will also have six themed channels alongside three highlight shows throughout the day Eastern time along with a spotlight series that focuses on the women of Team USA. Olympics coverage will be available for free on Peacock with the exception of Men’s Basketball. You’ll need a $4.99 subscription to watch those games.</p><p>If you’d rather watch from your computer, phone or tablet, NBC says “every single event” will be available through NBCOlympics.com and the NBC Sports app. Twitch will also serve up Olympics content, but not live events. There, you’ll find interviews, highlights and, of course, competitions. The platform will also host streams and co-streams with Twitch creators during some of the primetime broadcasts.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b709f1d0-e9a5-11eb-b6af-6f73c4de0fea" style="height:3648;width:5472;" alt="Tokyo 2020 Olympics - Table Tennis Training - Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium, Tokyo, Japan - July 20, 2021 General view of athletes during training REUTERS/Thomas Peter" data-uuid="89bcdda6-898a-3b07-a46a-098fc9f8abde"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Thomas Peter / reuters</div></figure><p>Several services and TV providers offer tools to help you keep up with all of the action. YouTube TV, for example, allows you to select which events you’re interested in and the app will automatically record them to its cloud DVR. Here’s to watching Swimming at a normal hour and not staying up until 2AM. YouTube TV has also added a medal table for quick reference and its “Jump To” feature lets you hop around events and specific moments easily. Cable providers <a href="https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/comcast-olympic-games-xfinity-customers-x1-flex-and-stream"><ins>like Comcast</ins></a> (owned by NBC’s parent company) are offering Olympics hubs on their services for easy access. There’s a degree of personalization across Xfinity tiers, for example, as well as notifications about “must-see moments” and playlists of highlights.</p><p>For a full schedule, <a href="https://www.nbcolympics.com/schedule"><ins>visit NBCOlympics.com</ins></a> to find info on all of the events you’re looking for.</p><p>Fans in the UK don’t have to contend with quite the time difference as those of us in the States, but they’ll still get to watch as much of the action as they want. The BBC is the official broadcaster in the UK and it’s <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/57597043"><ins>promising over 350 hours of coverage</ins></a> through early August. BBC One and BBC Two will show live events while an additional livestream will be available on BBC iPlayer. The network will have daily highlights and recap shows in both the morning and evening with anything that airs on BBC One or Two available on-demand via iPlayer. Coverage is also available through BBC Radio 5 Live and The Olympics Daily podcast.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/how-to-watch-the-tokyo-olympics-134504180.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1e13f8e2-e5ed-40a8-ba39-6b81126eaff0</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 13:45:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626874275</ingested><modified>2021-07-21T13:31:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Summer Olympics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Olympics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/65c97580-d43c-11eb-beff-966c1caa7050" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/65c97580-d43c-11eb-beff-966c1caa7050" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Pawel Kopczynski / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A general view of the Olympic Rings installed on a floating platform with the Rainbow Bridge in the background in preparation for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan June 21, 2021.

Gaming notebooks are lighter, more powerful and cheaper than ever before. They&#39;re particularly useful for students because their beefy hardware could be helpful for rendering video and doing any other schoolwork that would make super-thin ultraportables sweat. You can find some general advice on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-laptops-172033838.html">choosing gaming laptops in our guide</a>. In this piece, you&#39;ll find a few selections specifically geared towards school use.</p><h2>Are gaming laptops good for college?</h2><p>As stated above, gaming laptops are especially helpful if you&#39;re doing any demanding work. Their big promise is powerful graphics performance, which isn&#39;t just limited to games. Video editing and 3D rendering programs can also tap into their GPUs to handle especially demanding tasks. While you can find decent GPUs on some productivity laptops, like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:Dell&#39;s XPS 15" href="https://bit.ly/3A4C8Sb">Dell&#39;s XPS 15</a>, you can sometimes find better deals on gaming laptops. My general advice for any new workhorse machine: Get at least 16GB of RAM and the largest solid state drive you can find. Those components are both typically hard to upgrade down the line.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The one big downside to choosing a gaming notebook is portability. For the most part, we&#39;d recommend 15-inch models to get the best balance of size and price. Those typically weigh in around 4.5 pounds, which is a significantly more than three-pound ultraportables. Today&#39;s gaming notebooks are still far lighter than older models, though, so at least you won&#39;t be lugging around a 10-pound brick. Also, if you&#39;re not into LED lights and other gamer-centric bling, keep an eye out for more understated models (or make sure you know how to turn those lights off).</p><h2>Best midrange for most people: ASUS Zephyrus G15</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/6c703fb0-ea24-11eb-af5f-663ae06b840e" alt="Back to School - ASUS Zephyrus G15" data-uuid="f5191389-e401-3595-b1a4-f299ff8055c2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography / ASUS</div></figure><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Zephryus G15" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/Vy4P0E">Zephryus G15</a> has all the power you&#39;d want in a gaming laptop, at a price that&#39;s more reasonable than higher-end options. It&#39;s a slightly larger follow-up to last year&#39;s favorite for this category (the G14), but there&#39;s still lots to love. The G15 features AMD&#39;s latest Ryzen 5000 processors, along with NVIDIA&#39;s RTX 3000 GPUs. And, judging from our benchmarks, it manages to make good use of all that power. It also has a fast 165Hz 1440p screen, which is ideal for playing games at high framerates. The G15 doesn&#39;t have a webcam, but its solid specs and performance more than make up for that.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Buy Zephyrus G15 at Best Buy - $1,850" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/Vy4P0E">Buy Zephyrus G15 at Best Buy - $1,850</a></p><h2>Best high-end option: Razer Blade 15</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/92070d30-ea24-11eb-b79f-af7fe937acf3" alt="Back to School - Razer Blade 15" data-uuid="1c239297-3262-3911-9719-4537d22f412e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget</div></figure><p>For years, Razer has staked a reputation for building gaming laptops that look as good as MacBooks.

If money is no object, you can equip the Blade 15 with Intel&#39;s latest 11th-gen processors, NVIDIA&#39;s powerful RTX 3080 and either a 240Hz QHD or 360Hz HD screen.</p><p>While you&#39;ll pay a bit more for the Blade 15 compared to some other models, you&#39;ve still got a few different price points to work with.

That opens up a near desktop-level of multitasking, since you can have windows spread across both screens. That could be useful for browsing the web and keeping an eye on Twitter at the same time. (Or, perhaps squeezing in a game of <em>Overwatch</em> while following an online lecture on the other screen.

Today, the companies <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/07/21/argo-ai-ford-lyft-network.html">announced</a> that Ford&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-02-10-ford-argo-ai-self-driving.html">Argo AI</a>-powered cars will be available on Lyft&#39;s network later this year in Miami, followed by Austin in 2022. The move will allow passengers to choose a Ford self-driving vehicle with a safety driver in those regions when they book their ride from the app. By 2026, Ford plans to add 1,000 of its driverless vehicles to Lyft&#39;s fleet in multiple markets, a pact that the companies are in the process of finalizing.</p><p>The deployment should provide a shot in the arm for Lyft&#39;s autonomous ride-hailing ambitions. The company plans to get fully driverless fleets serving customers in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lyft-fully-driverless-cars-timeline-2023-motional-163854709.html">multiple US cities in 2023</a>. But, it suffered a setback last year when its self-driving partner <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-16-lyft-self-driving-tech-partnership-ending-magna.html">Magna</a> chose to shift to assisted driving products instead. The decision reflected wider concerns within the industry over the revenue-bleeding nature of autonomous driving. In December, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-atg-sale-aurora-221855364.html">Uber</a> decided to sell its self-driving unit to startup Aurora as a belt-tightening maneuver.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Fortunately for Lyft, it&#39;s had close ties with Ford — which is aggressively pursuing its own self-driving goals —since 2017. The partnership between the two companies was forged on the back of Ford&#39;s $1 billion investment in autonomous vehicle startup Argo AI. Since then, the automaker has been testing its driverless vehicle service in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-27-ford-will-test-self-driving-car-service-in-miami.html">Miami</a>, Austin and Washington, D.C.</p><p>“Argo and Ford are currently piloting, mapping and preparing for commercial operations of autonomous vehicles in more cities than any other [autonomous vehicle] collaboration, and this new agreement is a crucial step toward full commercial operations – the addition of Lyft’s world-class transportation network,” said Scott Griffith, CEO, Ford Autonomous Vehicles &amp; Mobility Businesses.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ford-self-driving-lyft-miami-123529662.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5435d52e-2dac-49d4-ab0f-59e4943101f2</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 12:35:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626870843</ingested><modified>2021-07-21T12:34:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/47130780-ea1e-11eb-975f-19c559780bd9" width="6410" height="4274" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/47130780-ea1e-11eb-975f-19c559780bd9" width="6410" height="4274" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ford]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Argo AI, Lyft and Ford]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Argo AI, Lyft and Ford]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['The Last Video Store' is a Blockbuster-inspired game coming to PSVR]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>People are weirdly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-07-last-blockbuster-in-australia-closing.html">fascinated</a> with Blockbuster, even though (or perhaps because) there&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blockbuster-airbnb-90s-sleepover-nostalgia-september-205924817.html">only one</a> remaining store in the entire world. You&#39;ll soon be able to re-experience that iconic yellow/blue design on PlayStation VR with an upcoming title called <em>The Last Video Store</em>.</p><p>It&#39;s being developed by RareBird Games, the company behind the extremely weird horror title <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/that-seinfeld-horror-game-looks-even-crazier-now-and-its-coming-to-ps5/"><em>Sinfeld Remastered</em></a>. The debut trailer ought to bring out those nostalgic feels, with the rows of DVDs and VHS tapes in a Blockbuster-like store, chilled out employees and an overly bright interior. It might even help you forget that in reality, the best titles were rarely available when you wanted them, and that Blockbuster&#39;s real business model was collecting late fees.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="aa5ffb864cda464395000e5452ef1e76"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wcz71RPKKm4?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>According to the trailer, you&#39;ll be able to explore the area around the store or take a night drive around the neighborhood. You&#39;ll also be able to engage a &quot;survival mode&quot; that includes &quot;realistic local jobs and bills to pay while managing your video enthusiast hobbies on the side.&quot; You can also select cult videos like <em>Evil Dead</em> and <em>Mac and Me</em> and watch them in a theater type environment, though it&#39;s hard to see how that would work in the final game, given licensing, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>Given how <em>Sinfeld</em> evolved since the first trailer, it&#39;s hard to say what form <em>The Last Video Store</em> may take when it&#39;s released — could it also become a horror title, for instance? Adding to the intrigue, the <em>Last Video Stor</em>e briefly appeared in the announcement trailer for Sinfeld, as <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/that-seinfeld-horror-game-looks-even-crazier-now-and-its-coming-to-ps5/"><em>GamesRadar</em></a> notes. There&#39;s no other information, so we&#39;ll have to wait and see where the rabbit hole eventually leads.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/a-blockbuster-style-video-store-simulator-is-coming-play-station-vr-120830200.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1e06f3f6-46b9-4491-94ff-1cbb17b47404</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 12:08:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626869313</ingested><modified>2021-07-21T12:09:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d2802b80-ea15-11eb-a7ef-799cecf42bc1" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d2802b80-ea15-11eb-a7ef-799cecf42bc1" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Rarebird Games]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A Blockbuster-style video store simulator is coming PlayStation VR]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[A Blockbuster-style video store simulator is coming PlayStation VR]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Valve will replace Big Picture mode with the new Steam Deck UI]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The upcoming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-181222143.html">Steam Deck</a> handheld could shape more than just Valve&#39;s hardware fortunes. According to a  Steam <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/bigpicture/discussions/1/5167301764850695635/">forum post</a> from a Valve employee, the console&#39;s user interface will replace Steam&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-12-03-steams-big-picture-mode-makes-playing-mac-games-on-tv-more-cons.html">Big Picture</a> mode, a front-end for your games that&#39;s compatible with bigger displays, TVs and controllers. A slick new UI will probably be welcomed by those who believe the almost decade-old Big Picture mode is on its last legs. In fact, the feature hasn&#39;t really been visually updated much since its launch.</p><p>Valve surprised everyone last week by dropping the Steam Deck — a Switch-like hybrid console for PC gaming — out of the blue. Pre-orders were swiftly opened for the device, which comes in three variants with different storage sizes priced at $399, $529 and $649. The Steam Deck features a custom Linux-based SteamOS.

For now, <em>Lanebreak</em> is still in early access mode with a full launch planned for this winter. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peloton-exercise-game-bike-090808077.html"><strong>Continue Reading</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2><strong>But wait, there’s more...</strong></h2><h2></h2><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-reportedly-delay-employees-return-to-office-093544574.html">Apple reportedly delays office return as US COVID-19 cases rise</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/square-enix-final-fantasy-xiv-servers-plan-193317600.html">Square Enix’s &#39;Final Fantasy XIV Online&#39; is very popular at the moment</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-verizon-rcs-partnership-161912204.html">All Verizon Android phones will support RCS messaging by 2022</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/duckduckgo-email-protection-tracking-pixels-privacy-151024634.html">DuckDuckGo tackles email privacy with new tracker-stripping service</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/roku-streambar-99-deal-amazon-roku-streaming-devices-sale-134034742.html">Engadget Deals: Roku sale on Amazon knocks the Streambar down to $99</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-is-offering-up-to-35-percent-off-its-kindle-e-readers-100536845.html">Engadget Deals: Amazon&#39;s Kindle sale slashes up to 35 percent off its popular e-readers</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-ht-a7000-soundbar-ht-a9-home-theater-system-140038379.html">Sony&#39;s latest flagship soundbar offers Dolby Atmos and 360 Reality Audio</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/radrover-6-plus-ebike-120056788.html">The RadRover 6 Plus is a &#39;durable&#39; $1,999 e-bike with a 750W motor</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-college-dorm-room-essentials-143052706.html">The best dorm room essentials for college students</a></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-after-blue-origin-crew-space-111512692.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e53ed7ba-1579-493a-b65b-ada3e6d540ff</guid><dc:creator>Mat Smith</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 11:15:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626861563</ingested><modified>2021-07-21T09:59:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mat Smith]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/7914db20-ea08-11eb-afff-e81e32305f69" width="3000" height="1581" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/7914db20-ea08-11eb-afff-e81e32305f69" width="3000" height="1581" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Blue Origin]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Image of Mark Bezos, Wally Funk and Oliver Daemen while in zero-g in Blue Origin's first flight.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Blue Origin Crew in Space]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pro Evolution Soccer will become 'eFootball' in free-to-play shift]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Konami&#39;s cult <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pes-soccer-2021-anniversary-season-update-next-generation-113032674.html">Pro Evolution Soccer </a>series is trying a new tactic in its endless duel against FIFA. To stand out from its bigger rival, the soccer franchise is adopting a new name, <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/eu/en/topics/15974/"><em>eFootball</em></a><em>,</em> and going free-to-play on consoles, PC and mobile.&nbsp;</p><p>Clearly, this isn&#39;t a one-off. Konami has rebuilt the game using Unreal engine as part of the shift to providing a digital service. The biggest change to gameplay is the new &quot;motion matching&quot; technology designed to make player animations more realistic. Gamers will choose from different movements in real-time during matches. Seeing as the original Pro Evo&#39;s gameplay is what helped to distinguish it from FIFA, motion matching could prove a make or break feature.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="8b20117749394526b10d12d2bd9b615d"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jzd7OpCHCi0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>As you&#39;d expect from an F2P title, <em>eFootball </em>will regularly receive new updates after its launch this fall. Konami will have to tread with care, however. Free-to-play games have attracted the ire of players and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-12-uk-government-loot-boxes-regulation.html">regulators</a> alike due to their exploitative nature, best summed up by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-17-loot-boxes-illegal-gambling-regulators-europe-us.html">loot boxes</a> that cost real money to obtain. The last thing the storied developer wants is to sully Pro Evo&#39;s name. Maybe, that&#39;s why it&#39;s changing it.&nbsp;</p><p>But, the news will probably raise alarm bells for fans. Konami said that only &quot;local matches&quot; featuring FC Barcelona, Juventus, FC Bayern, Manchester United &quot;and others&quot; will be available for free at launch. While, certain game modes will later be sold as optional DLC, &quot;giving players the freedom to build an experience&quot; that matches their interests. It&#39;s a major risk that Konami is banking on to restore the franchise as a regular feature in dorms and living rooms around the world.&nbsp;</p><p>The game will land in early fall with cross-generation matchmaking between current and last-gen PlayStation and Xbox consoles. Later in the fall, you can expect a managerial-style team building mode, online leagues, and a match pass system that rewards you with items and players. At the same time, cross-platform play will be introduced between consoles and PC. The winter will see the release of mobile controller support, full cross-play including mobile and the launch of professional and amateur eSports tournaments.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/pro-evolution-soccer-efootball-104633019.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3c41fd85-e2a8-43d7-a354-8c4e23f6b04b</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 10:46:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626864397</ingested><modified>2021-07-21T10:47:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Soccer]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/08b7e2d0-ea0f-11eb-afbf-3e77b8e14559" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/08b7e2d0-ea0f-11eb-afbf-3e77b8e14559" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Konami]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Konami]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Konami]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Study suggests EVs really are cleaner than gas-powered cars over their lifespan]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The lifetime emissions of an electric car versus a gasoline vehicle has become an intensely debated topic for governments. A new <a href="https://theicct.org/publications/global-LCA-passenger-cars-jul2021">study</a> that compares the climate impact of passenger cars could play a pivotal role in the argument. The report claims that electric cars produce far fewer greenhouse gas emissions &quot;from the cradle to the grave&quot; than their gas-guzzling counterparts. According to the study, the core result is the same globally, even when applied to countries like China and India, where the majority of the electricity to recharge an EV comes from coal.</p><p>The findings are a rebuke for voices in the automotive and oil lobbying industries that still claim that electric cars are no cleaner than gas-powered vehicles. It arrives as governments are trying to cement their environmental policies in line with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-15-countries-reach-deal-to-implement-paris-climate-change-agreement.html">Paris Agreement</a>. Finalized in 2015, the climate change accord saw 143 countries, including the US, agree to limit global temperature increases to less than 2 degrees Celsius. To help meet that target, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/washington-state-gas-car-sales-ban-2030-175652987.html">Washington</a> state and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-to-ban-sale-of-new-gaspowered-cars-by-2035-180313529.html">California</a> have proposed banning the sale of new gasoline cars from 2030 and 2035, respectively.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The study conducted by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) examined the entire life-cycles of EVs and gasoline cars, from extracting raw materials to production to their eventual disposal. Researchers examined the greenhouse gas emissions from the vehicle and fuel types in four territories that together account for 70 percent of new car sales worldwide: the US, the EU, China and India.</p><p>For cars registered in 2021, the report found that lifetime emissions for a medium-sized EV in Europe are between 66 and 69 percent lower compared to that of a gasoline vehicle in the same category. In the US, an EV produces between 60 to 68 percent fewer emissions. In China, an EV results in between 37 to 45 percent fewer emissions. In India, it’s between 19 to 34 percent lower.</p><p>By 2030, the gap between EVs and gas-guzzlers is tipped to increase to 74 percent to 77 percent in Europe, 62 percent to 76 percent in the US, 48 percent to 64 percent in China, and 30 percent to 56 percent in India.&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, the researchers assume that a vehicle will be on the road for around 18 years. They also state that the gap between the figures reflects the uncertainty around how the energy mix in each region develops, which itself is tied to future policies.</p><p>“One important result of the analysis is to show that life-cycle emissions trends are similar in all four regions, despite the differences among them in vehicle mix, grid mix, and so on. Already for cars registered today, [battery electric vehicles] have better relative [greenhouse gas] emissions performance everywhere than conventional vehicles,” said ICCT deputy director Rachel Muncrief.</p><p>There are still caveats, however. Though EVs cut back on carbon emissions over time, they inevitably take a toll on the environment. By one recent <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/green-electric-vehicle-170633036.html">estimate</a>, you&#39;ll need to drive a new EV thirteen and a half thousand miles before you&#39;re doing less harm than a gas-guzzling saloon.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ev-cleaner-gas-cars-lifespan-study-095041081.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">583f4d57-9713-41b3-9e06-9f1464c98102</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 10:25:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626860926</ingested><modified>2021-07-21T09:49:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Pollution & Waste]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4b39fe40-ea05-11eb-bfdd-9d7e1cad4897" width="7400" height="4933" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4b39fe40-ea05-11eb-bfdd-9d7e1cad4897" width="7400" height="4933" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[JENS SCHLUETER via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Employees work on the assembly line for the Volkswagen (VW) ID 3 electric car of German carmaker Volkswagen, at the 'Glassy Manufactory' (Glaeserne Manufaktur) production site in Dresden, eastern Germany on June 8, 2021.

One of the most useful changes to Maps is the expansion of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-27-google-maps-public-transit-crowdedness-predictions-delays.html">transit crowdedness predictions</a> to over 10,000 cities in 100 countries.&nbsp;</p><p>Companies are expecting their staff to get back to the office in the near future, and crowdedness prediction can let you know if the train or bus line you&#39;re waiting for has a lot of open seats, or if it&#39;s already crowded. That way, you can decide whether to hop on or wait for the next one in hopes that it isn&#39;t as jam-packed.  Maps can make predictions by combining AI tech with contributions from people using Google Maps, along with historical location trends.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/de222960-ea0c-11eb-975f-6e028f97245a" style="height:897;width:1200;" alt="Google Maps" data-uuid="9fbfc329-04e6-3f2e-9303-596db5bbcac9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>If you&#39;re in New York and Sydney, you can even see a train&#39;s level of crowdedness down to transit car level in real time. Maps will mark the least crowded cars, so you can line up for one of them, thanks to data from transport agencies in the areas. It&#39;s still a pilot at the moment, but Google says the feature will be available in more cities soon.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, the tech giant has launched a new Timeline Insights tab for the Maps app. So long as you&#39;re on Android and you have Location History switched on, you&#39;ll be able to view &quot;monthly trends about how you’re navigating the world.&quot; For instance, that&#39;s where you can see how much time you spend at different places, such as shops or airports, and the distance and time for each mode of transportation you&#39;ve taken. The tech giant says it developed the feature after users told the company that they want &quot;to be more intentional about how they spend their time&quot; after living through the pandemic.</p><p>Finally, Trips in the Timeline tab is now available to everyone on Android, so you can relive the vacations you&#39;ve had in the past. In case your favorite travel destination still isn&#39;t welcoming tourists, you can go to the section and virtually visit hotels, restaurants and other places you&#39;ve previously enjoyed.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-maps-features-post-lockdown-life-100004041.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">97dd6b88-ba3f-4e2c-b617-0ff883a58244</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 10:00:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626862681</ingested><modified>2021-07-21T10:18:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Travel & Tourism]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-03/7c707a70-6914-11ea-bbc2-8ad1adea04d7" width="5311" height="3541" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-03/7c707a70-6914-11ea-bbc2-8ad1adea04d7" width="5311" height="3541" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Halfpoint Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A woman commuter using public transport in summer.

The hardware HW 3.0 update will now cost $1,000 rather than $1,500, a 33 percent drop in price. To get the feature, owners will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-full-self-driving-subscription-price-availability-151630041.html">have to pay</a> a monthly subscription fee of up to $199 on top of that, or $10,000 all in one shot.&nbsp;</p><p>Tesla <a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-tesla-cars-being-produced-now-have-full-self-driving-hardware">famously said</a> in 2016 that all its EVs produced going forward would have full self-driving hardware. However, it eventually found that a computer update would be needed on older vehicles and started shipping later models with the new HW 3.0 hardware. However, owners of Tesla models produced between late 2016 and mid-2019 were shocked to get hit with a $1,500 hardware upgrade bill on top of the cost of the FSD upgrade.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>After telling customers they&#39;d be charged $1,500 for the hardware update, Tesla appears to have lowered that to $1,000.
