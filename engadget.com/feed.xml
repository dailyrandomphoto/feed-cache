In the span of a week, it has added two additional discovery tools. The first, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-whats-new-bell-icon-130053002.html">What’s New</a>, is a panel that highlights new releases from your favorite artists and podcasts. The second, which the company <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-07-30/spotifys-new-noteable-releases-playlist-highlights-the-names-behind-some-of-your-favorite-hits/">detailed today</a>, is a curated playlist, but one that’s aimed at those who want to know more about the music industry.</p><p>Dubbed &quot;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX1dd5WKvvHTC?utm_source=embed_v2&amp;go=1&amp;play=1&amp;nd=1">Noteable Releases</a>,&quot; the weekly playlist collects new tracks from the world’s leading producers and songwriters. Expect to see contributions from people like frequent Billie Eilish collaborator Finneas O’Connell and Ester Dean, who helped write Katy Perry’s 2010 hit “Firework.” The result is an eclectic playlist that doesn’t stick to any one genre, though pop music is represented strongly for obvious reasons.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The introduction of Noteable Releases follows last year’s rollout of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-12-spotify-songwriter-pages-beta.html">songwriter pages</a> and is another example of the company trying to cater to the broader music industry. You’ll notice at the top of the playlist that Spotify encourages digging into a song’s credits to find out more about the people who worked on it. You can do that by tapping the three dots icon and then “show credits.”</p><div id="bb2180b2285043f29953a3d9870b581d"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:380px;position:relative;"><iframe src="//dk79lclgtez2i.cloudfront.net/g0DT1Ea" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/spotify-noteable-releases-playlist-162503482.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a30046ae-2a42-4eba-b764-a36f94130ef4</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 16:25:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627661892</ingested><modified>2021-07-30T16:18:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Music]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/326d8c90-f150-11eb-96fb-a84762bb37e5" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/326d8c90-f150-11eb-96fb-a84762bb37e5" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Spotify]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Spotify Notable Releases]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Spotify Notable Releases]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why Tesla is delaying the Semi EV until 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="c2a3749a233f416b88449f3029277d51"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZEEyfYkeyPA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Following its Q2 earnings call this week, Tesla representatives confirmed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-delays-semi-truck-2022-102502178.html">previous reports</a> that its commercial EV project, Semi, will be delayed until 2022.

The New Wave movement might have been little more than a ripple, Synth Pop may have never happened and, in a roundabout way, Calvin Harris might never have known <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOkQ4T5WO9E">what we came for</a>.</p><p>But Numan <em>did </em>hear that all-important sound, the one that lit up his brain and switched him on to technology as a music-making tool, paving the way for electronic music to go mainstream. That’s just one of many accidentally influential moments to be found in <em>Watch the Sound with Mark Ronson</em> — a documentary jaunt through the cornerstones of music technology that’s streaming now on Apple TV+.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Ronson is, perhaps, best known for his work with Amy Winehouse — a decidedly analog, brassy affair. But his love of technology is abundantly clear as <em>Watch the Sound</em> serves up easily digestible bites of musical history around key technological themes: Sampling, drum machines, synths and beyond. Along the way, Ronson casually drops in on such luminaries as Paul McCartney, Quest Love and the aforementioned Numan, along with contemporary artists such as Charlie XCX and King Princess. If the series doesn’t inspire you to google around for a MIDI controller by the end of it then nothing ever will.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2ce426d0-f141-11eb-93eb-c2847fcbb39d" alt="Watch the Sound with Mark Ronson." data-uuid="74e3cd1a-98cf-3d19-9392-7cc9d841667b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple TV+</div></figure><p>Unlike Netflix’s fast-paced <em>This is Pop</em>, <em>Watch the Sound</em> leans more histrionic. Each episode starts with Ronson recounting his own first experience with whatever this episode is about (a sampler, distorted guitars and so on). He then spends time with artists that popularized that sound, asking pensive questions and generally nerding out about music as only someone with Ronson’s wide palette of influences really can.</p><p>This sense of a journey through Ronson’s musical interests gives <em>Watch the Sound</em> a more intimate feel than <em>This is Pop</em>’s more talking heads approach. “I think what&#39;s important is that there is a familiarity between the episodes, there is a kind of a guiding force. And that was always going to be Mark&#39;s personal experience,” executive producer Mark Monroe told Engadget.</p><p>This sense of “experience” is perhaps no more apparent when Ronson spends time with Sean Ono Lennon. Lennon talks candidly about his father’s own struggle with the sound of his voice. He then adroitly reinvents a recording of Lennon senior with Harmony Engine (that Ronson describes as “autotune on steroids”) in what turns out to be a surprisingly tender moment. Lennon junior is visibly moved by this brief yet intimate musical encounter.</p><div id="787f06283be546a3aea104dd5ee80768"><iframe src="//dk79lclgtez2i.cloudfront.net/rO4pM0v" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Of course, the show is about the machines as much as the people that made them important. Watching DJ Premier’s absolute mastery of the MPC, for example, is as impressive as it is frustrating (at least to anyone else who’s had a go on one and could barely peck out a beat). Later on, watching Ronson take a box cutter to a speaker cone with David Grohl feels like it should have been an outtake until... goddammit, why is he somehow good at everything? (You’ll have to watch it to find out why they did this.)</p><p>Other humorous moments are, perhaps, less intentional. Ronson at one point finds himself in a full miner’s jumpsuit, and he’s never looked so uncomfortable. In episode one, we enjoy a rare, albeit slight crack in his golden touch as he struggles to make anything remotely musical with autotune (he rectifies that later, naturally).</p><p>If there were an enduring message in <em>Watch the Sound</em> (and many other series of its ilk) it’s that perfection and talent are rarely what creates something magical. Most of the technology featured was either misused, misunderstood or reappropriated through necessity. Legends were born thereof and this is just how we do things now.</p><p>It’s refreshing, if not invigorating to know that you don’t have to aspire to perfect pitch or even really have any formal musical training to be a pioneer. In fact, it’s easy to convince yourself that knowing your scales might even hold you back sometimes if you find yourself trying to only play by the rules.</p><p>This sentiment is solidified in the episode about synthesizers. Here, the cast of heroes is more at home with an oscilloscope than with an oboe. The band of misfits (and, let history show, many, many more women than are ever given credit) effectively reinvented what music could be from the ground up.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3955f6d0-f143-11eb-be7f-9259c7abf5f5" alt="Watch the Sound with Mark Ronson." data-uuid="c891b547-0024-3f6e-8f7c-4169808c0e13"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple TV+</div></figure><p>Monroe said that was something that became apparent during filming, too. “Digging into synthesizer and really kind of understanding what a disruptor it was … what an opportunity for the people on the outside of the music business … and not just to gain a foothold, but to become, you know, legendary.”</p><p>Even if you don’t have an interest in how music is made, the show will have you jotting down the names of bands and songs you want to explore further and delight you with a sense of possibility. Or in my case, vindication. The episode on sampling recounts the abhorrent push-back that this new technology received. “That’s not real music” someone remembers being told. If, like me, you grew up listening to <em>Fear of a Black Planet</em> and the countless artists it inspired, it’s hard not to do a mental fist-pump to yourself for not being one of those jerks.</p><p>By the end of the show, you might find yourself motivated to dig out that guitar from the loft, or fire up your laptop. Apple, it seems, knew this might be the case. To coincide with the show’s launch, the company has created a “companion experience” for GarageBand via an <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/07/garageband-features-new-sound-packs-from-dua-lipa-lady-gaga-and-top-producers/">exclusive Producer Pack</a>.</p><p>That said, once you discover how the Beastie Boys achieved their iconic vocal sound on &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ru3gH27Fn6E">So What’Cha Want</a><em>&quot; </em>or how Sonic Youth creatively used drumsticks on their guitars, you might realize you don’t even need any fancy software to do something different.</p><p><em>Watch the Sound with Mark Ronson</em> premieres on Apple TV+ today.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-watch-that-sound-with-mark-ronson-151607013.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d3fb9c1f-b48f-44e4-8a59-a61ecc283df2</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 15:16:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627657287</ingested><modified>2021-07-30T15:01:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Music]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/08e2c660-f141-11eb-9ebc-5c09671ec2b6" width="3840" height="2025" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/08e2c660-f141-11eb-9ebc-5c09671ec2b6" width="3840" height="2025" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple TV+]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Watch the Sound with Mark Ronson.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Watch the Sound with Mark Ronson]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[NYC extends limits on food delivery app fees to February 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>New York City capped food delivery app fees to help restaurants <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-27-food-delivery-apps-coronavirus.html">survive the COVID-19 pandemic</a>, and it&#39;s keeping those limits in place as the recovery begins. <em>Gothamist</em><a href="https://champ.gothamist.com/champ/gothamist/food/new-york-city-council-puts-new-limits-food-delivery-apps">reports</a> the City Council has passed a bill that <a href="https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=4991369&amp;GUID=FE1FC4C2-576C-4D91-80CA-AF58F4CF4B18&amp;Options=Advanced&amp;Search=&amp;utm_source=hngry&amp;utm_campaign=df9118511d-nice-day-free&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_35292bb014-df9118511d-4386102">extends</a> caps on delivery app fees until February 17th, 2022. The limits were due to expire in August and kept fees no higher than 15 percent for deliveries, plus 5 percent for other services. Apps could have charged up to 35 percent without the fee ceiling.</p><p>Queens Council Member Francisco Moya claimed a return to higher fees would &quot;completely&quot; hobble businesses just starting to recover from the pandemic.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Other bills passed at the same time require apps to get written approval before listing businesses and to share customer data with restaurants. Delivery services have faced criticism, <a href="https://www.eater.com/21537215/restaurants-sue-third-party-delivery-service-grubhub-for-listing-businesses-without-permission">lawsuits</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/grubhubdrivers/comments/ksh1gm/its_now_illegal_for_delivery_apps_to_list/">legislation</a> after listing restaurants in their apps without permission.</p><p>The app creators have opposed New York City&#39;s new measures. GrubHub claimed the caps were &quot;arbitrary price controls&quot; that would allegedly damage businesses and the economy. DoorDash, meanwhile, suggested that data sharing with restaurants should be opt-in rather than enabled by default. The company was determined to &quot;protect the privacy&quot; of users, a spokesperson said.</p><p>The companies haven&#39;t been completely opposed to reduced fees. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/doordash-cutting-restaurant-fees-in-half-130002696.html">DoorDash</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-17-doordash-reduces-commission-fees.html">GrubHub</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-16-uber-eats-waives-delivery-fees-independent-restaurants.html">Uber Eats</a> and others started cutting and waiving some fees as the pandemic began. Their concern, as you might guess, is that these caps might become permanent and restrict the apps&#39; long-term viability. It&#39;s not an unfounded fear — San Francisco&#39;s Board of Supervisors <a href="https://www.nycfoodpolicy.org/food-policy-snapshot-san-francisco-delivery-app-commission-fee-cap/">recently voted</a> to permanently cap delivery app fees in the city.</p><p>At the same time, there&#39;s little doubt that restaurants are eager to avoid a return to pre-pandemic fees. Some eateries were only reluctantly listing themselves in these apps due to the large fees, and in many cases have <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/27/business/restaurant-delivery-alternatives/index.html">offered</a> incentives to customers who order directly. While NYC&#39;s extension won&#39;t necessarily ensure a given restaurant&#39;s survival, it could help that restaurant maintain familiar profits or keep prices in check.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/new-york-city-food-delivery-caps-extended-145712985.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d3047620-284d-4462-8d35-e0395f68322e</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 14:57:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627657036</ingested><modified>2021-07-30T14:57:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/96894650-f13d-11eb-bbbe-352aaaa5c947" width="8660" height="5773" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/96894650-f13d-11eb-bbbe-352aaaa5c947" width="10320" height="6880" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Christine McCann via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[New York, NY, USA - August 23, 2020: A Grubhub food delivery man rides south down Lexington Avenue on Manhattan's upper east side in the east 90's on a quiet Sunday in August.

The CNPD fined the company €746 million ($888 million) on July 16th for violating the bloc&#39;s strict data privacy laws, known as GDPR. Amazon disclosed the ruling in an <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001018724/cbae1abf-eddb-4451-9186-6753b02cc4eb.pdf">SEC filing</a> on Friday in which it slammed the decision as baseless, adding that it intended to defend itself &quot;vigorously in this matter.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>“There has been no data breach, and no customer data has been exposed to any third party,” Amazon told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-30/amazon-given-record-888-million-eu-fine-for-data-privacy-breach?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. “These facts are undisputed. We strongly disagree with the CNPD’s ruling.” It added that it plans to appeal the decision. Amazon has its EU headquarters in Luxembourg, tasking the local data regulator with overseeing its compliance.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The penalty is the result of a 2018 complaint by French privacy rights group La Quadrature du Net, which filed numerous <a href="https://www.laquadrature.net/en/personnal-data/">lawsuits</a> against Big Tech companies on the behalf of 12,000 people shortly after the GDPR was established that year.&nbsp;</p><p>Among those was a case involving Google&#39;s Android operating system that led to France&#39;s CNIL regulator slapping the search giant with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-21-france-fines-google-over-gdpr.html">$57 million fine</a> in January, 2019 — the biggest GDPR fine to date. The watchdog ruled that the company had violated the GDPR due to its failure to obtain legal consent for data collection related to its ad targeting practices.</p><p>The record penalty comes amid heightened scrutiny of Amazon&#39;s business in Europe. Its use of data is also at the heart of the EU&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eu-amazon-antitrust-third-party-data-114513778.html">antitrust investigation</a>. Following a year-long probe, officials in November reached a preliminary decision that Amazon had breached competition rules by using third-party seller data to boost its own products. At the same time, they launched a second investigation into its alleged preferential treatment of its own products on its site and those of its partners.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fine-eu-data-privacy-130443268.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0665f444-43af-434d-8d80-bbf2be34bf2e</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 13:04:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627650287</ingested><modified>2021-07-30T13:04:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-05/47b9e9a0-9093-11ea-affb-c3580aa7bb62" width="3500" height="1888" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-05/47b9e9a0-9093-11ea-affb-c3580aa7bb62" width="3500" height="1888" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tobias Schwarz / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A worker stands his designated workspace at a packing station as he supervises items for delivery from the 70,000 square metre warehouse floor at Amazon's new distribution center in Brieselang, near Berlin November 28, 2013.

These objects — called 203 Pompeja and 269 Justitia — are redder than the reddest known objects in the asteroid belt and may have migrated to the area from beyond Neptune. If that&#39;s true, then they could provide insight into the chaos of the early solar system and into how the solar system as we know it today came to be.</p><p>The team led by JAXA&#39;s Sunao Hasegawa identified the objects through observations collected at the Infra-red Telescope Facility and Seoul National University Astronomical Observatory, according to the paper they published. As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/28/science/red-asteroids-belt.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a> points out, most objects in the inner solar system tend to reflect blue light, because they&#39;re devoid of or have very little organic materials. Objects from the outer solar system such as the Kuiper belt, however, tend to be redder. That&#39;s because they have a lot of organics like carbon and methane, which may have been the building blocks of our planet. As you may know, the Kuiper belt is the region extending from the orbit of Neptune where you can find remnants of our solar system&#39;s formation.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If Pompeja and Justitia truly were transplants from beyond Nepture, then they&#39;d serve as evidence for the hypothesis that a fraction of the asteroids between Jupiter and Mars came from the Kuiper belt. They&#39;d also support the set of theories, called the Nice Model, on how our gas giants settled into their orbits. The Nice model says our giant planets formed closer to the Sun until an instability forced Neptune, Uranus and Saturn to move outwards and Jupiter to move inwards. The event would&#39;ve caused asteroids rich in organic materials to scatter and move around the solar system.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, more observations and evidence are needed to be able to prove that the two objects are from the Kuiper belt. The good thing is that since the asteroid belt is much closer to us than Neptune, it would take a spacecraft less time to reach them if ever Earth&#39;s space agencies decide to send a probe to study them more closely.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/two-red-objects-asteroid-belt-115517310.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">817038fb-6d91-4e9d-bbaa-1112a0a243c2</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 11:55:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627644533</ingested><modified>2021-07-30T11:29:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c8dea740-f11e-11eb-abde-d2e93093e9e4" width="3686" height="2052" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c8dea740-f11e-11eb-abde-d2e93093e9e4" width="3686" height="2052" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[brunorbs via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Asteroid belt in outer space]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Asteroid belt 3D CGI Render in space, stars and sun flares in the background]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Doctor Who' needs to evolve to survive]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The BBC has announced that Chris Chibnall (pictured, center), Doctor Who’s executive producer, and its star, Jodie Whittaker (pictured, right), will <a href="https://www.doctorwho.tv/news/?article=jodie-whittaker-chris-chibnall-leave-doctor-who"><ins>leave the series in 2022</ins></a>. A trio of specials through next year would herald the pair’s departure from the long-running series. This, then, seems like an ideal time for Doctor Who to undergo the radical shakeup it so desperately needs.  I don’t agree with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jul/20/exterminate-exterminate-why-its-time-for-doctor-who-to-die"><em><ins>The Guardian’s</ins></em></a> recent piece saying that the series needs to be off the air for a while, but it is very clearly time for the show to evolve again.</p><p>This is in part because Doctor Who under Chibnall has been such a waste: the showrunner’s work before taking the job, while popular and award-winning, had always left me cold. My initial <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-01-26-chris-chibnall-doctor-who.html"><ins>apprehension</ins></a> was calmed, somewhat, by the news emerging from the production of the revived series’ 11th run. Chibnall also deserves credit for hiring the first two writers of color in the show’s nearly <em>sixty year</em> history. The fact that many of the episodes had an explicit focus on material social history suggested a bright new direction for the series. <em>The Woman Who Fell To Earth</em>, too, was a blisteringly confident debut and all seemed well.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>And then, <em>yeesh</em>. As good as Chibnall is at birthing some truly inspired ideas, the quality of his execution is terrible. He struggled to flesh out the quartet of lead characters and failed to offer them real stakes to deal with. And for all of the era’s emphasis on diversity, the content of each episode seemed to be far more backward-looking. I’ve written <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-14-doctor-who-spyfall-big-tech.html"><ins>before</ins></a> about Chibnall often appearing to make the argument opposite to the one he thinks he’s making. Unless he <em>intended</em> to say that polite protest is the only good protest, Amazon’s treatment of its staff is good, actually, and that we can all benefit from the spoils of colonialism.</p><p>Naturally, the casting of a woman in the central role encouraged the usual petulance from <em>those</em> corners of the internet. Sadly, I think that the actors involved have all performed miracles trying to make anything Chibnall writes remotely believable. And Whittaker’s departure before she could work with another executive producer will be yet another tragically wasted opportunity in this era. I hope that this bad-faith criticism doesn&#39;t force the production team to make a “safe” choice for the next Doctor.</p><p>The big secret to <em>Doctor Who’s</em> endurance is both the malleability of its premise and its knack for reinventing itself. Every few years, often as the show’s creative team changed, it would become an almost entirely different show. You could argue that this lack of sentimentality has been the case since the show’s first mission-switch, which happened in its <em>fifth</em> episode. The revived show has been using a version of the <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> template since 2005, and it’s starting to wear a bit thin.</p><p>It didn’t help that while Series 11 was designed to avoid any of the show’s dense backstory, Series 12 was at times incomprehensible to anyone but die hard fans. Chibnall, after all, devoted his series arc to validating a production gaffe in an episode that aired on January 24th, <em>1976</em>. (And, in doing so, made the Doctor the Time Lord equivalent of Jesus, contradicting everything that we’d learned over the last six decades.) This was the worst kind of self-indulgent fan fiction, and hardly a bold new direction for a mainstream drama.</p><p>Unfortunately, the media landscape has changed, and competition has intensified beyond all belief. The BBC no longer has a monopoly on the conversation as it did — at least here in the UK — and is dwarfed by the streaming giants. Netflix, Amazon, Disney and others also have the wealth to offer the sort of creative freedom that once made the non-commercial BBC stand out among the crowd.</p><p>The knee-jerk reaction, I’m sure, will be to demand Doctor Who jumps on the bandwagon driven by Marvel’s recent streaming shows. That would be a mistake, because Who is at its best when it pushes away from whatever genre show is cresting into the mainstream that year. Financially, the BBC can’t compete with these mega-franchises, but the quality of its writing and its unique sensibilities, can. The one thing that the series could learn from those shows, however, is how to build every episode into an <em>event</em>.</p><p>This could mean that the show becomes a run of occasional specials with a longer running time, like a glorified movie of the week. Or it could, like the COVID-influenced 2021 season, be a shorter run of tightly-interconnected episodes. Chibnall may indeed stumble onto the template that helps revitalize the show going forward, but I’m personally hoping for something more radical.</p><p>For instance, if Doctor Who can’t succeed as a glossy, hour-long standalone drama, then why not go back to being a series of short serials? Netflix’s <em>Russian Doll</em> and the BBC’s<em> I May Destroy You</em> are both examples of (excellent) half-hour dramas that offer a break from the current prestige-drama template. It helps, too, that <em>Doctor Who</em> was run in this format for 25 of its first 26 seasons, and offers new — or at <em>least different</em> — methods for structuring a story.</p><p>It may also make it easier to binge during its long second life on a streaming platform. Think about it: how many times have you ducked watching a long episode of <em>The Crown</em> because it’s too much time to invest out of your day, but you’ll happily burn through four episodes of <em>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</em> without complaint. You could even get Michaela Coel to write it, although at this point I’ll settle for anyone who isn’t named Chris Chibnall.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/doctor-who-chibnall-whittaker-departure-reformat-series-113012792.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d897381a-78e4-435a-b3e9-6d4c2ac7d851</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 11:30:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627642885</ingested><modified>2021-07-30T11:01:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Television]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/920d1000-f11c-11eb-bfff-8f13a14dac72" width="3400" height="2413" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/920d1000-f11c-11eb-bfff-8f13a14dac72" width="3400" height="2413" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Gary Gershoff via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NEW YORK, NY - OCTOBER 05:  (L-R) Producer Matt Strevens, writer Chris Chibnall and actress Jodie Whittaker visit Build Series to discuss the series 'Doctor Who' at Build Studio on October 5, 2018 in New York City.

It added that the site had been disconnected from the power grid and that there will be no impact to the electric supply. French energy company Neoen, which operates the facility, and contractor Tesla are working with emergency services to manage the situation.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As a result of the fire, a warning for toxic smoke has been issued in the nearby Batesford, Bell Post Hill, Lovely Banks and Moorabool areas, reports <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/fire-breaks-out-during-testing-of-victorian-big-battery-near-geelong-20210730-p58eh4.html"><em>The Sydney Morning Herald</em></a>. Residents were warned to move indoors, close windows, vents and fireplace flues and bring their pets inside.</p><p>The Victorian Big Battery site, a 300 MW/450 MWh battery storage facility, is viewed as key to the Victorian government&#39;s 50 percent renewable energy target by 2030. It follows the success of Neoen and Tesla&#39;s 100 MW/129 MWh battery farm in Hornsdale in South Australia, which was completed ahead of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-12-01-tesla-live-world-largest-battery-south-australia.html">schedule</a> and has resulted in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-06-tesla-s-big-battery-is-undercutting-australia-s-energy-cartels.html">multi-million dollar savings</a> for market players and consumers. Both sites essentially provide a regional power backup for when renewable energy is not available, effectively filling the gap when the sun isn&#39;t shining and the wind isn&#39;t blowing.</p><p>In February, Neoen announced that the Victorian Big Battery would utliize Tesla&#39;s megapacks — utility-sized batteries produced at the company&#39;s Gigafactory — and Autobidder software to sell power to the grid. Victorian Big Battery has a contract with the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO). As part of the pact, the site will provide energy stability by unlocking an additional 250 MW of peak capacity on the existing Victoria to New South Wales Interconnector over the next decade of Australian summers.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-megapack-fire-victorian-big-battery-105535797.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">92b888ce-b5c1-4ea3-8f3f-4af45e3b384a</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 10:55:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627650399</ingested><modified>2021-07-30T13:06:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/598e5970-f124-11eb-a77f-dc6474f5a68a" width="1920" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/598e5970-f124-11eb-a77f-dc6474f5a68a" width="1920" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Victorian Big Battery]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Victorian Big Battery]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Victorian Big Battery]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[NASA and Boeing delay Starliner ISS launch]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Boeing Starliner&#39;s trip to the International Space Station has hit another hurdle. The craft was scheduled for a second uncrewed test flight to the ISS today, July 30th, after its first attempt went <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-20-boeing-starliner-nasa-uncrewed-test-flight.html">awry</a> back in late 2019. But, it will have to wait a bit longer for take off. NASA and Boeing have decided to <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/commercialcrew/author/aagriffi/">push back</a> the launch to the tentative date of Tuesday, August 3rd.&nbsp;</p><p>The delay comes after the thrusters on the ISS&#39; new Russian module Nauka accidentally activated causing the station to move out of orientation. Though ground teams managed to regain control and motion of the ISS, NASA is proceeding with caution.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;The International Space Station team will use the time to continue working checkouts of the newly arrived Roscosmos Nauka multipurpose laboratory module and to ensure the station will be ready for Starliner’s arrival,&quot; the agency said in a statement.</p><p>The completion of the second test flight is a critical part of the Starliner&#39;s development phase that will be followed by the first of six crew rotation missions. NASA added that launch preparations would resume pending a final decision from the ISS and Commercial Crew Program teams.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, staff are assessing whether to move the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket — atop which the Starliner is placed — from the launch pad at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station back to the Vehicle Integration Facility. While both are mission-ready, the move is seen as a mitigation measure to protect them from weather damage.</p><p>The delay is the latest in a series of setbacks that have thus far prevented the Starliner from reaching the ISS. In December 2019, the Boeing craft suffered an automation issue during its first test flight that caused it to miss its planned orbit.

Now, the automaker has agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle the class action lawsuit filed against it.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-agrees-pay-15-mln-settle-claims-over-temporary-battery-voltage-reduction-2021-07-29/"><em>Reuters</em></a>, the court documents show that the software update affected 1,743 Model S sedans in the US. The voltage limitation was temporary, but the plaintiffs experienced a 10 percent battery reduction for three months and a seven percent reduction lasting for another seven months, the plaintiffs&#39; lawyers said. Tesla rolled out the final update that fully corrected the issue in March 2020. Among the affected vehicles, 1,552 had their max battery voltage restored, while 57 vehicles had battery replacements. The settlement documents said that any vehicle still experiencing battery throttling problems would have their maximum voltage restored over time.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the company has agreed to pay $1.5 million, a huge chunk of that would be used to cover lawyers&#39; fees: Owners are expected to get only $625 each from the settlement. Affected owners in Norway could get a much bigger payday after a court in the country ordered the company to pay them $16,000 each to settle a lawsuit over the same issue. In the US, aside from agreeing to pay up, Tesla has also agreed to provide battery-related diagnostics and notifications for cars under warranty whenever battery repairs may be needed.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-settle-model-s-battery-throttling-complaints-080705951.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">80f56564-f69d-4bd8-ad2b-6c1b9f4f4261</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 08:07:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627641152</ingested><modified>2021-07-30T10:32:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/5982eac0-f103-11eb-b56f-abc2b9ff8b6b" width="1600" height="999" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/5982eac0-f103-11eb-b56f-abc2b9ff8b6b" width="1600" height="999" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tesla Model S]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tesla Model S]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[HBO returns to Dish's lineup after a protracted absence]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dish Network is finally offering HBO, Cinemax and HBO Max to its subscribers after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-01-hbo-dish-att.html">kicking HBO off its network</a> nearly three years ago. It&#39;s the first time Dish subscribers will be able to watch HBO shows like <em>Mare of Easttown</em> and <em>Euphoria</em> since the carriage dispute began on October 31st, 2018. However, the new agreement doesn&#39;t cover Dish subsidiary Sling TV&#39;s distribution of HBO or HBO Max.&nbsp;</p><p>When Dish removed HBO and Cinemax channels, it accused then-parent  AT&amp;T of using HBO as an &quot;economic weapon.&quot; At that time, HBO was only a straight cable station, but <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-09-hbo-max.html">AT&amp;T launched HBO Max</a> as a Netflix-like streaming service in July of 2019. With the situation now resolved, Dish becomes the last major pay TV distributor to add HBO Max to its lineup.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The resolution follows a major shakeup with HBO&#39;s parent, WarnerMedia. In May 2021, AT&amp;T <a href="https://about.att.com/story/2021/warnermedia_discovery.html">announced</a> that it was spinning off that division and merging it with Discovery in a $43 billion deal. That effectively removed a conflict of interest as AT&amp;T is a direct competitor to Dish in the satellite video service provider space. The parties haven&#39;t disclosed the terms of the new agreement.&nbsp;</p><p>With an accord now in pace, Dish customers get a free 10-day free of HBO and Cinemax from Aug. 6-15. Dish users can subscribe to the HBO Max ad-free plan for $12 rather than the regular price of $15 per month for up to 12 months if they act before Oct. 27, 2021. They&#39;ll get HBO Max access on supported devices like iOS, Android, Roku, Apple TV and Fire TV, along with live channels including HBO, HBO Family and HBO Signature. Dish TV customers can also get Cinemax for $10 per month.</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hbo-returns-to-dishs-lineup-after-protracted-dispute-is-resolved-061504019.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">19f26d8c-32d0-4da6-b5ce-92daca0dace4</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 06:15:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627623117</ingested><modified>2021-07-30T05:32:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/458c0180-f0f1-11eb-9ffb-8da3e7244d30" width="1200" height="632" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/458c0180-f0f1-11eb-9ffb-8da3e7244d30" width="1200" height="632" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[HBO]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[HBO returns to Dish's lineup after a protracted absence]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[HBO returns to Dish's lineup after a protracted absence]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's first-gen Echo Show 5 is back to its lowest price on Best Buy]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/NKQk7q">Amazon&#39;s first-gen Echo Show 5</a> dropped <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-5-first-gen-good-deal-081030616.html">down to $45</a> from its original price of $80 ahead of Prime Day back in June.

The device supports Amazon Prime, NBC and Hulu, so you can use it to watch shows, as well as to display images and videos.&nbsp;</p><p>If you find its screen too small for serious bingeing, though, you can also use it as an alarm clock with several clock faces to choose from. It even comes with a sunrise feature, which slowly brightens the screen fifteen minutes prior to your alarm time to mimic the effects of daylight&#39;s arrival. While the device isn&#39;t available in blue like its newer sibling, you can get either the &quot;Charcoal&quot; (black) or the &quot;Sandstone&quot; (white) color options for $45 on Best Buy.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-first-gen-echo-show-5-lowest-price-best-buy-044542257.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">03fd9c80-4dd5-4c68-86b9-fca5eaff7a1a</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 04:45:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627617919</ingested><modified>2021-07-30T04:05:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d358a810-f0e2-11eb-a76f-188f1b5b03d5" width="1500" height="950" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d358a810-f0e2-11eb-a76f-188f1b5b03d5" width="1500" height="950" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Echo Show]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Echo Show]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[AMD's Radeon RX 6600XT is its next flagship 1080p GPU]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After making a return to the mid-range with its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amd-radeon-rx-6700-xt-review-midrange-gpu-130005529.html">RX 6700 XT GPU</a>, AMD has launched its 1080p flagship, the RX 6600 XT. A successor to the excellent and popular <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-21-amd-radeon-rx-5600-xt-review.html">RX 5600 XT card</a>, the new model has considerably more power on tap with 9.6 teraflops of RDNA 2 performance, compared to 7.19 teraflops for the last model. Not only that, but it offers 8GB of GDDR6 RAM, compared to 6GB for its predecessor.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, the RX 6600 XT seems to deliver about the same amount of performance as the RX 5700 XT (9.75 teraflops) and just slightly less than the GPU in the PS5, at least on paper. Since the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-07-radeon-rx-5700-xt-review.html">RX 5700 XT</a> was offered as a 1440p-capable card (and the PS5 can handle 4K), it doesn&#39;t seem a stretch to say that the new model will at least be decent at 1440p gaming.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>However, AMD is marketing this card as a &quot;new standard for 1080p,&quot; saying that it has up to a 1.7 times uplift over the last generation for games like <em>Doom Eternal</em> for 1080p gaming. AMD noted that around two-third of monitors shipped are still 1080p, so that&#39;s still the norm for PC gaming.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0dab64e0-f0e7-11eb-a8bf-0e4bf50147f5" alt="AMD&#39;s Radeon RX 6600XT is its next flagship 1080p GPU" data-uuid="a892f838-20c5-3201-96ee-cbd67724e6f7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">AMD</div></figure><p>Other specs include 32 compute units (compared to 40 on the RX 6700 XT), a 2359 MHz game clock and 160W power consumption with a single 8 pin power connector.  AMD also touts custom features like Radeon Boost for higher frame rates and Radeon Anti-Lag for improved latency.</p><p>The main new feature with the 6000-series GPUs, however, is ray-tracing. That feature allows for higher resolutions (1440p and 4K) while still maintaining decent frame rates and allowing for more realistic images. Don&#39;t expect too much from the RX 6600 XT, however, as the RX 6700 XT struggled in ray-tracing tests compared to NVIDIA rivals <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amd-radeon-rx-6700-xt-review-midrange-gpu-130005529.html">in our review</a> — and the RX 6600 XT has lower specs all around.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, it looks pretty impressive otherwise for a budget-level 1080p card. We&#39;ll soon see a raft of RX 6600 XT models from ASUS, Gigabyte, MSI (above), ASRock and others, with MSRP starting at $379 and shipping set for August 11th. Take it as a miracle if you get one at that price, though — the RX 5600 XT had a suggested retail of $300, but street prices were often double that and more thanks to the cryptomining and the global GPU shortage.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amd-unveils-the-radeon-rx-6600-xt-gpu-designed-for-1080-p-gaming-033049778.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">830515a6-3b84-40b3-a8ec-a033a2741c73</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 03:30:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627623768</ingested><modified>2021-07-30T05:43:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/deb61eb0-f0e0-11eb-bbff-8cfb8677f1dc" width="1000" height="616" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/deb61eb0-f0e0-11eb-bbff-8cfb8677f1dc" width="1000" height="616" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NVIDIA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[AMD's Radeon RX 6600XT is its next flagship 1080p GPU]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[AMD's Radeon RX 6600XT is its next flagship 1080p GPU]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[IBM's AI can predict how Parkinson's disease may progress in individuals]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the past, we’ve seen doctors use AI software to detect <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-penn-medicine-brain-tumor-ai-151105509.html">brain tumors</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-31-deepmind-ai-illness-prediction-veterans-affairs.html">kidney illness</a> and various<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-01-googles-ai-can-detect-breast-cancer-more-accurately-than-expert.html"> cancers</a>. Now, researchers from IBM and Michael J. Fox Foundation (MJFF) say they’ve developed a program that can predict how the symptoms of a Parkinson’s disease patient will progress in terms of both timing and severity. In The <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS2589-7500(21)00101-1/fulltext">Lancet Digital Health</a> journal, they claim the software could transform how doctors help patients manage their symptoms by allowing them to better predict how the disease will progress.</p><p>“Our aim is to use AI to help with patient management and clinical trial design. These goals are important because, despite Parkinson’s prevalence, patients experience a unique variety of motor and non-motor symptoms,” IBM said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The breakthrough wouldn’t have been possible without the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative, a study the Michael J. Fox Foundation sponsored. IBM describes the dataset, which includes information on more than 1,400 individuals, as the “largest and most robust volume of longitudinal Parkinson’s patient data to date” and says it allowed its AI model to map out complex symptom and progression patterns.</p><p>It’s estimated Parkinson’s disease affects more than 6 million people globally, and there’s currently no known cure for it. IBM Research and MJFF plan to continue work on the AI model. In the future, they hope to make it better at providing more granular characterizations of the various stages of the disease.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ibm-research-michael-j-fox-foundation-parkinson-disease-ai-223058404.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3aa7d1fc-61af-4aaa-bbf5-fc439eec5fc8</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jul 2021 22:30:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627597345</ingested><modified>2021-07-29T22:22:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health Care Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Disease & Medical Conditions]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/f4c528e0-6a03-11eb-89ff-b0c4c3cb5498" width="4050" height="2700" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/f4c528e0-6a03-11eb-89ff-b0c4c3cb5498" width="4050" height="2700" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[sudok1 via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[MR image of human brain]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[MR image of human brain.]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's Fire TV Cube works with Zoom, if you have a webcam]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Starting today, you can use a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-11-amazon-fire-tv-cube-2019-review.html"><ins>second-generation Fire TV Cube</ins></a> to take part in <a href="https://amazonfiretv.blog/two-way-video-calling-with-zoom-now-available-on-fire-tv-cube-2nd-gen-7ba70699386a"><ins>two-way Zoom calls</ins></a>.

The company also suggests mounting the device on the top of your TV set, and that you sit about six to 10 feet away. At the very least, you’ll want a 720p camera that supports USB Video Class (UVC). You’ll also need a Micro USB-to-USB adapter since the second-generation Fire TV Cube doesn’t have a full-sized USB-A port. One thing to note is Amazon recommends against using a 4K-capable camera. Outside of those requirements, you’ll need to download the latest Fire TV Cube update and the Zoom app from the Fire TV Appstore.</p><p>Once you have everything ready to go, you can tell Alexa to join a video call for you, at which point the voice assistant will ask you to provide a meeting ID and passcode. It’s also possible to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G66R7GDSL86KNFUN"><ins>link your calendar to Alexa</ins></a>, which will allow you to more seamlessly join any Zoom meetings you have on your schedule.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Amazon isn’t the first company to allow you to use your TV for video calls.

Over that same time frame, Amazon has offered two-way video calling between Fire TV Cube and camera-enabled Alexa devices.
