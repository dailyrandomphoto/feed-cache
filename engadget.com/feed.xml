You will be able to upload and sync your photos and videos across Google Photos as well as Drive. There&#39;s the option to sync external storage devices with the cloud as well. In addition, you&#39;ll be able to mirror Drive files on your computer, with locally stored versions of files for faster access.</p><p>On top of that, you can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-14-google-backup-and-sync.html"><ins>sync local folders</ins></a> such as your desktop and documents.

Google renamed the app to Drive for desktop, and it will gain features from Backup and Sync in the coming months. Google will prompt Backup and Sync users to switch over to Drive for desktop. From October 1st, Backup and Sync <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/07/google-drive-backup-and-sync-transition.html"><ins>will stop working</ins></a>, so you&#39;ll need to make the transition to keep backing up your files with Drive.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-drive-for-desktop-app-file-syncing-backup-172510389.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8dd20c9a-8545-44ef-9d35-1138b1204cbe</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 17:25:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626110714</ingested><modified>2021-07-12T17:25:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/556004e0-e335-11eb-b7e2-0ad4d5374263" width="967" height="452" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/556004e0-e335-11eb-b7e2-0ad4d5374263" width="967" height="452" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Drive]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Drive]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[YouTube Shorts are now available in 100 countries globally]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-shorts-short-video-format-142727867.html">limited release in India</a> late last year and a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-shorts-tiktok-competitor-comes-to-us-130035377.html">US beta at the start of 2021</a>, YouTube is expanding the availability of Shorts, its TikTok competitor, to the than 100 countries. When the company first introduced the format, anyone could view a Short. However, only those in about two dozen countries could access the tools YouTube created for filming and editing Shorts. With today’s announcement, the company is making those tools widely available, meaning you’re likely to see more and more of the clips appear on the platform.</p><p>YouTube’s embrace of short-form videos comes just as TikTok itself becomes a bit more like YouTube. At the start of July, the company, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-testing-3-minute-video-length-new-limit-155521258.html">following months of testing</a>, gave all of its users the ability to record clips up to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-three-minute-videos-now-available-182016623.html">three minutes long</a>.

Rodnyansky told <a href="https://variety.com/2021/streaming/global/apple-first-look-alexander-rodnyansky-1235017386/"><em><ins>Variety</ins></em></a> that the agreement makes Apple &quot;the very first of all the global streaming platforms to sign a strategic partnership with a company with Russian roots.&quot;</p><p>Rodnyansky&#39;s credits include <em>Cloud Atlas, Sin City: A Dame to Kill for</em> and <em>Machete Kills</em>, but he says it&#39;s his experience and production expertise in Russia that primarily led Apple to work with him. He produced Russian films <em>Leviathan</em> and <em>Beanpole,</em> which both won awards at the Cannes Film Festival and were Best Foreign Language Film Oscar nominees.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The deal with Apple is for several shows, some of which will be set inside Russia. The shows will be overseen by Russian writers and directors as well as international creatives.</p><p>Rodnyansky notes streaming has helped shows made in a variety of languages and countries to become international hits. “This is an amazing time when you have <em>Fauda</em> in Hebrew and Arabic doing really well across multiple territories, when you have French-speaking shows like <em>La Mante</em> or <em>Marianne</em>, or German shows like <em>Dark</em> or <em>Babylon Berlin</em> crossing borders,” Rodnyansky said. “This is a time for Russian-speaking shows to do the same, or multilingual shows.&quot;</p><p>Apple has similar first-look deals in place with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-kitbag-napoleon-movie-142125089.html">Ridley Scott</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-20-apple-first-look-deal-ron-howard.html">Ron Howard&#39;s</a> production companies, but the AR Content pact hints at its international ambitions. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/netflix">Netflix</a>, which has expanded to all but a few countries and territories, has found success in acquiring and making international content. Spanish crime drama <em>Money Heist</em> has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-q1-2020-204146022.html"><ins>been a massive hit</ins></a>, while French thriller <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-q4-2020-211411926.html"><em><ins>Lupin</ins></em></a> is Netflix&#39;s most successful original series so far this year. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-spriggan-trailer-2022-release-date-231200486.html">Anime</a> and Korean dramas are also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2021/06/18/lupin-international-tv/"><ins>growing in popularity</ins></a> among subscribers. Earlier this year, Netflix <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/05/netflix-anna-k-leo-tolstoy-anna-karenina-first-russian-original-svetlana-khodchenkova-1234764255/">picked up</a> a modern-day adaptation of <em>Anna Karenina</em> as its first original drama series in Russian.</p><p>It&#39;s not too surprising that Apple is looking at a similar approach to content. Apple TV+ only has a few non-English-language projects available to stream, including <em>Tehran</em> and <em>Losing Alice</em>, so there&#39;s a lot of scope for Apple to expand its library with Russian and multilingual shows.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-plus-russian-language-multilingual-shows-alexander-rodnyansky-ar-content-155904970.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0a19c0eb-4d12-4597-b899-e5b77e5cf215</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 15:59:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626105549</ingested><modified>2021-07-12T15:59:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/68d77600-e328-11eb-bcfd-5f370f2bdacb" width="3500" height="2341" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/68d77600-e328-11eb-bcfd-5f370f2bdacb" width="3500" height="2341" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mario Anzuoni / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Producer Alexander Rodnyansky of the movie "Leviathan," nominated for an Academy Award for Foreign Language Film, poses for a portrait in Los Angeles, California February 3, 2015.

Virgin Galactic told the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> in a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-has-a-ticket-to-space-too-with-richard-bransons-virgin-11626012705">statement</a> that Musk bought a ticket aboard the company&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-richard-branson-spaceflight-complete-154012847.html">air-launched rockets</a>. It&#39;s not certain just where the SpaceX founder is in the queue, but it&#39;s safe to say his ride will garner some attention.</p><p>The feeling is mutual. In an <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/richard-bransons-space-flight-is-about-to-win-the-billionaire-race-to-the-stars-3pw8zvfwh">interview</a> with the <em>Sunday Times</em>, Branson said Musk was a &quot;friend&quot; and suggested he might fly on a SpaceX ship &quot;one day.&quot; He even went so far as to <a href="https://twitter.com/richardbranson/status/1414199651037716485">tweet</a> a photo showing him and Musk together.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Just don&#39;t expect that kind of warmth and camaraderie from Jeff Bezos. Blue Origin was more than a little eager to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-throws-shade-virgin-galactic-133319071.html">trash-talk Virgin</a> ahead of its first fully crewed spaceflight, claiming that Branson and team were merely brushing the edge of space. While the company later wished Branson a &quot;great flight,&quot; we wouldn&#39;t expect Bezos and Branson to have heart-to-heart coffee chats any time soon.</p><p>It&#39;s not a complete shock that Branson and Musk would be so cozy. However well their personalities mesh, the two aren&#39;t quite direct competitors. Virgin Galactic is aimed primarily at space tourists content with suborbital flights, while <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-orbit-live-launch-stream-123903068.html">Virgin Orbit</a> is focused on launching satellites for outfits that can&#39;t justify expensive conventional rockets. SpaceX, meanwhile, has focused its tourism efforts on lunar flybys and usually carries costlier payloads into space. This isn&#39;t to say the two execs will start feuding if their businesses truly overlap — just don&#39;t count on the positive vibes lasting forever.</p><div id="590fcca69a3240fd8f4b317c0328c9f9"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Big day ahead.

And yes, you can make exceptions. Any number in your contact list or allowed numbers will still get through, and you can correct an accidental block by telling the app to ignore the filter for future calls.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The updated app is available now for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vzw.ecid">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/verizon-call-filter/id777875529">iOS</a>. Neighborhood filtering isn&#39;t the most sophisticated defense against scam calls, but it&#39;s arguably overdue. This kind of spamming is frequent, to the point where you might get multiple calls per day. A simple filter could lead to far fewer annoyances, not to mention greater trust in those calls that do come in.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/verizon-call-filter-neighborhood-spoofing-142918590.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0f8db3a2-3dc3-4fd9-8c8a-fb8ef18ca46d</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 14:29:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626100160</ingested><modified>2021-07-12T14:29:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9115a580-e317-11eb-bfac-e5e6b7860112" width="3543" height="2362" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9115a580-e317-11eb-bfac-e5e6b7860112" width="3543" height="2362" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Verizon logo is seen displayed on a phone screen in this illustration photo taken in Poland on November 19, 2020.

Regulators have thrown down the gauntlet for local companies by announcing new privacy rules for those seeking foreign stock market listings, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-widens-clampdown-overseas-listings-with-pre-ipo-review-firms-with-large-2021-07-10/"><em>Reuters</em></a>. As a result, any company that has data on more than a million customers must face a review into how they handle that info in order to receive permission for a foreign IPO.&nbsp;</p><p>Regulators will scrutinize the risks of said data being being affected, controlled or manipulated by external governments following overseas flotations. In a broader effort to get companies to list locally, China is adding the two sets of rules that focus on data collection and data storage to its Data Security Law and the Personal Information Protection Law.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The constraints arrive in the midst of a privacy crackdown by Beijing. Regulators have previously rattled their sabres at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/china-says-tiktok-bytedance-linkedin-misuing-dada-133448710.html">TikTok and LinkedIn</a> for alleged data collection violations. Just last week, authorities caused shockwaves by ordering ride-hailing giant <a href="https://www.engadget.com/china-orders-didi-chuxing-app-removal-153419577.html">Didi to remove its app from mobile stores</a> in the wake of its US listing, causing its shares to initially plummet by 20 percent.</p><p>With US-China tensions still simmering, the decision will likely pile pressure on President Biden to increase scrutiny of Chinese businesses.

Whatever the reasons behind the latest price cut, the Buds Pro are still worthy of your cash due to their bombastic sound. Firstly, unlike the $150 Buds+, they boast active noise cancellation and a wider audio range that features more depth and clarity thanks to the internal 1mm woofer and a 6.5mm tweeter.&nbsp;</p><p>Voice calls have also been improved with the help of three microphones, an accelerometer and Wind Shield tech for when you&#39;re outdoors. What&#39;s more, battery life matches Samsung&#39;s estimates at five hours with ANC and Bixby turned on and eight hours with them off, or 28 hours total with the case — which supports wireless charging. For those looking for durability, the IPX7-rating means you can dunk them in up to 1 meter of water for 30 minutes. Overall, they&#39;re still our highest rated Samsung earbuds with an exemplary review score of 85.&nbsp;</p><p>Just note that before you purchase them it may be worth familiarizing yourself with Woot&#39;s terms and conditions. For the uninitiated, the online retailer mainly offers limited-time deals with a modified return policy to its parent Amazon that includes numerous exceptions, including charges for shipping costs.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-all-time-low-122528401.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cac21999-0026-4046-bf24-e44044e4b09b</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 12:25:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626089386</ingested><modified>2021-07-12T11:30:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/35316a10-e303-11eb-acee-8b317f57a73a" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/35316a10-e303-11eb-acee-8b317f57a73a" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Galaxy Buds Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Galaxy Buds Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[MIT robot could help people with limited mobility dress themselves]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Robots have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-11-30-mind-controlled-telepresence-robot.html">plenty of potential</a> to help people with limited mobility, including models that could help the infirm put on clothes. That&#39;s a particularly challenging task, however, that requires dexterity, safety and speed. Now, scientists at MIT CSAIL have developed an algorithm that strikes a balance by allowing for non-harmful impacts rather than not permitting any impacts at all as before.&nbsp;</p><p>Humans are hardwired to accommodate and adjust to other humans, but robots have to learn all that from scratch. For example, it&#39;s relatively easy for a person to help someone else dress, as we know instinctively where to hold the clothing item, how people can bend their arms, how cloth reacts and more. However, robots have to be programmed with all that information.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="2aafa51cf73346e498eb0f7a1065b79d"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-9JrDMBg2HE?rel=0" style="border:0;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>In the past, algorithms have prevented robots from making any impact with humans at all in the interest of safety. However, that can lead to something called the &quot;freezing robot&quot; problem, where the robot essentially stops moving and can&#39;t accomplish the task it set out to do.&nbsp;</p><p>To get past that issue, an MIT CSAIL team led by PhD student Shen Li developed an algorithm that redefines robotic motion safety by allowing for &quot;safe impacts&quot; on top of collision avoidance. This lets the robot make non-harmful contact with a human to achieve its task, as long as its impact on the human is low.</p><p>&quot;Developing algorithms to prevent physical harm without unnecessarily impacting the task efficiency is a critical challenge,&quot; said Li. &quot;By allowing robots to make non-harmful impact with humans, our method can find efficient robot trajectories to dress the human with a safety guarantee.&quot;</p><p>For a simple dressing task, the system worked even if the person was doing other activities like checking a phone, as shown in the video above. It does that by combining multiple models for different situations, rather than relying on a single model as before. &quot;This multifaceted approach combines set theory, human-aware safety constraints, human motion prediction and feedback control for safe human-robot interaction,&quot; said Carnegie Mellon University&#39;s Zackory Erickson.</p><p>The research is still in the early stages, but the ideas could be used areas other than just dressing. &quot;This research could potentially be applied to a wide variety of assistive robotics scenarios, towards the ultimate goal of enabling robots to provide safer physical assistance to people with disabilities,&quot; Erickson said.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/mit-csail-unveils-a-robot-that-helps-the-infirmed-dress-themselves-120016438.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">150237df-ad42-4411-9fee-574701281407</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 12:00:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626087445</ingested><modified>2021-07-12T10:57:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/85a7c910-e2f6-11eb-aeff-7248bac689f6" width="1800" height="1123" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/85a7c910-e2f6-11eb-aeff-7248bac689f6" width="1800" height="1123" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[MIT CSAIL]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[MIT CSAIL unveils a robot that helps the infirmed dress themselves]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[MIT CSAIL unveils a robot that helps the infirmed dress themselves ]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Finally, Virgin Galactic completes its first crewed spaceflight]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After oh so many delays, training up its founder, Sir Richard Branson, and some delightful, sometimes petty, banter with Blue Origin (love those “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-throws-shade-virgin-galactic-133319071.html https://www.engadget.com/...">largest windows in space</a>” claims), Virgin Galactic has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-richard-branson-spaceflight-complete-154012847.html https://www.engadget.com/...">made it into space.</a></p><p>Or at least, it did, depending on who you ask.

If you sign up for the beta version 2.21.140.9 on Testflight, you&#39;ll be able to send photos and videos that self-destruct as soon as they&#39;re viewed and dismissed.

The first, the weekly series <a href="https://www.clubhouse.com/event/mZb22V1y"><em>Thank Your Ass Off</em></a>, debuts through the platform on July 12th at 11AM Eastern.</p><p>The arrangement lets TED sell ads and sponsorships for its conversations. Clubhouse won&#39;t take a share, either.

The <em>Wall Street Journal</em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-firms-to-buy-covid-19-vaccines-on-behalf-of-taiwans-government-11626020496">reports</a> that the two companies have agreed to buy 10 million Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine doses on behalf of Taiwan&#39;s government. The two are purchasing the shots from Fosun Pharmaceutical, the vaccine&#39;s exclusive distributor across the Greater China region, after China allegedly &quot;spiked&quot; Taiwan&#39;s bid to directly buy the vaccine.</p><p>There was pressure to make a deal. Taiwan has largely kept COVID-19 levels low throughout the pandemic, but new cases started surging in late April and prompted rare restrictions on the island. While infections are dropping, Taiwan has only vaccinated about 14 percent of its population. It will need many more doses if it&#39;s going to lift restrictions while keeping cases low.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Tech companies like have offered to buy vaccines for employees and contractors before. Apple helped TSMC buy vaccines for its staff, for instance. A purchase this large for the general population breaks new ground, however — the companies are buying enough doses to inject over 40 percent of Taiwan&#39;s 24 million people.</p><p>Foxconn and TSMC have strong incentives to step in. Outbreaks could hurt their operations, even for those factories and other facilities beyond Taiwan. That could be particularly dangerous amid a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-macbook-assembly-delayed-global-chip-shortage-115005064.html">global chip shortage</a> and other manufacturing headaches — mass infections and shutdowns could cause further snarls.

As <em>AV Club</em><a href="https://www.avclub.com/marvel-says-black-widow-made-60-million-on-disney-plus-1847269075?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;utm_campaign=dlvrit&amp;utm_content=avclub">reports</a>, Disney has <a href="https://dmedmedia.disney.com/news/black-widow-surpasses-215m-between-box-office-and-disney-plus-premier-access">revealed</a> that Marvel blockbuster <em>Black Widow</em> raked in more than $60 million in estimated revenue solely from customers paying $30 each for Premier Access. That&#39;s more than a quarter of the roughly $215 million Disney expected to make from all sources, including US and international box office sales.</p><p>The company also bragged that <em>Black Widow</em> was the largest US box office opening during the COVID-19 pandemic, just besting <em>F9</em>. That wasn&#39;t difficult, though, given that movie theaters have routinely <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amc-avoids-bankruptcy-with-funding-164243952.html">struggled to attract viewers</a> when they weren&#39;t dealing with widespread closures.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We wouldn&#39;t count on Disney providing Premier Access figures on a regular basis, especially as the pandemic continues to (hopefully) subside and more people are comfortable venturing to theaters. To some extent, the media giant needed the $60 million number to make <em>Black Widow</em>&#39;s debut sound more impressive. We&#39;d add that it&#39;s difficult to compare this against data for rivals like Amazon and Netflix. They don&#39;t have equivalents to Premier Access, so they measure success for original movies largely in terms of viewership and new subscriptions.</p><p>Nonetheless, this represents an important milestone for Disney as it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-focuses-on-streaming-203003919.html">shifts toward streaming</a>. It&#39;s now comfortable mentioning Premier Access numbers after months of staying quiet. Even if Premier Access fades into the background, it&#39;s now a significant part of Disney&#39;s movie release strategy.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/black-widow-disney-plus-opening-weekend-174633013.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a1b5365f-504c-425e-ae86-797df877d054</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jul 2021 17:46:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626025595</ingested><modified>2021-07-11T17:46:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4ffb4490-e26a-11eb-a3bb-79ed7fcceb53" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4ffb4490-e26a-11eb-a3bb-79ed7fcceb53" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jay Maidment/Marvel Studios]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Scarlett Johansson in Marvel movie 'Black Widow']]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Scarlett Johansson in Marvel movie 'Black Widow']]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['FIFA 22' brings more realistic soccer to next-gen consoles on October 1st]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>EA isn&#39;t just giving <a href="https://www.engadget.com/madden-nfl-22-release-date-152359613.html"><em>Madden NFL</em></a> players an upgrade if they play on next-gen consoles.

However, it is clear that the gaming giant wants to offer a strong incentive to play on newer machines.

Soon, however, it might just be a question of sending a robot to do the job. <em>Universe Today</em><a href="https://www.universetoday.com/151657/researchers-have-taught-a-drone-to-recognize-and-hunt-down-meteorites-autonomously/">reports</a> that researchers have <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06523">developed</a> a system that has autonomous drones use machine learning to find the smaller meteorites in impact sites that are either &#39;hidden&#39; (even if observers traced the fall) or simply inaccessible.</p><p>The technology uses a mix of convolutional neural networks to recognize meteorites based on training images, both from online images as well as staged shots from the team&#39;s collection. This helps the AI distinguish between space rocks and ordinary stones, even with a variety of shapes and terrain conditions.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The results aren&#39;t flawless. While a test drone did correctly spot planted meteorites, there were also some false positives. It could be a while before robotic aircraft are trustworthy enough to provide accurate results all on their own.</p><p>The implications for space science are significant if the technology proves accurate, though. It would help scientists spot and potentially recover meteorites that are either too small to find or too remote. That, in turn, could help pinpoint meteorite sources and identify the rocks&#39; compositions. Simply put, drones could fill gaps in humanity&#39;s understanding of the cosmic debris that lands at our doorstep.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/drones-find-meteorite-impact-sites-215545994.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">532540d9-aa99-4c3c-ba4c-53634e2b2dd2</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jul 2021 21:55:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625954148</ingested><modified>2021-07-10T21:56:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/eca3b250-e1c5-11eb-b3df-cf69f46de933" width="8000" height="5265" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/eca3b250-e1c5-11eb-b3df-cf69f46de933" width="8000" height="5265" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Stefano Barzellotti via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Meteor Crater, also called Canyon Diablo crater, Barringer Crater, Coon Mountain and Coon Butte, is the best preserved meteor crater in the world.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Aerial view of Meteor Ctater in Arizona.]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Kaseya was warned about security flaws years ahead of ransomware attack]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The giant <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kaseya-ransomware-cyberattack-155719139.html">ransomware attack against Kaseya</a> might have been entirely avoidable. Former staff <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-10/kaseya-failed-to-address-security-before-hack-ex-employees-say">talking</a> to <em>Bloomberg</em> claim they warned executives of &quot;critical&quot; security flaws in Kaseya&#39;s products several times between 2017 and 2020, but that the company didn&#39;t truly address them. Multiple staff either quit or said they were fired over inaction.</p><p>Employees reportedly complained that Kaseya was using old code, implemented poor encryption and even failed to routinely patch software. The company&#39;s Virtual System Administrator (VSA), the remote maintenance tool that fell prey to ransomware, was supposedly rife with enough problems that workers wanted the software replaced.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>One employee claimed he was fired two weeks after sending executives a 40-page briefing on security problems. Others simply left in frustration with a seeming focus on new features and releases instead of fixing basic issues. Kaseya also laid off some employees in 2018 in favor of outsourcing work to Belarus, which some staff considered a security risk given local leaders&#39; partnerships with the Russian government.</p><p>Kaseya has declined to comment.</p><p>The company has showed signs of wanting to mend issues. It fixed some problems after Dutch researchers pointed out vulnerabilities. It didn&#39;t fix everything, however, and it didn&#39;t take long before analyst firms like Truesec found glaring flaws in Kaseya&#39;s platform. This wasn&#39;t the first time Kaseya faced security issues, either. The company&#39;s software was reportedly used to launch ransomware at least twice between 2018 and 2019, and it didn&#39;t significantly rethink its security strategy.</p><p>However accurate the reports may be, Kaseya&#39;s situation wouldn&#39;t be unique. Staff at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-customer-support-compromised-solarwinds-hackers-033613290.html">SolarWinds</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-bitcoin-scam-social-engineering-hack-access-193040357.html">Twitter</a> and others have described security lapses that weren&#39;t fixed in time. That just makes the situation worse, mind you. It suggests that key parts of American online infrastructure have been vulnerable due to neglect, and that these basic missteps are all too common.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/kaseya-warned-of-security-flaws-before-ransomware-210226358.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5f7c076c-59eb-44ce-8f8a-9567849cec7a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jul 2021 21:02:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625950949</ingested><modified>2021-07-10T21:02:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/898ecaf0-e1bc-11eb-ae12-0e6aaa2d983e" width="5760" height="3840" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/898ecaf0-e1bc-11eb-ae12-0e6aaa2d983e" width="5760" height="3840" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dado Ruvic / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Kaseya logo and binary code seen in this illustration taken, July 5, 2021.
