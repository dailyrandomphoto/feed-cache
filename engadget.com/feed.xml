After all, the only way to avoid range and lines-at-the-charger anxiety is to make sure you can get power whenever you need it. That’s what makes a project, started by Indiana’s Department of Transport, so exciting: It’s working on a road that can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/magnetized-concrete-could-charge-your-ev-while-you-drive-041225378.html"><ins>charge your EV as you drive</ins></a>.</p><p>Backed by the National Science Foundation, and in partnership with Purdue University, the team will test concrete embedded with magnetized particles. This magnetized cement, or Magment, will be produced by a German company (also called Magment). The idea will, if early tests prove successful, see Indiana’s DOT build a quarter-mile track of Magment to see if it can charge a heavy duty truck while it trundles along.</p><p>A number of countries, including the UK and Sweden, are currently testing road-based charging. If it works, we won’t need to reorder our lives to accommodate an EV. Better still, permanently available power may make it easier to build cars with smaller batteries, knowing you’re never more than a few inches from your next set of electrons.</p><p>— Dan Cooper</p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-frame-rate-limiter-battery-life-180208866.html"><ins>Steam Deck can limit frame rates to give you longer battery life</ins></a></h2><h3>The target is 30 frames per second for an extra hour or two of juice.</h3><p></p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-frame-rate-limiter-battery-life-180208866.html "><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2ab22bf0-ed6d-11eb-a72b-e0286b87a86d" style="height:975;width:1920;" alt="Valve Steam Deck with carrying case" data-uuid="28f47b8f-26a0-30af-8609-9e4ae4e34a98"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valve</div></figure></a><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-181222143.html"><ins>Steam Deck</ins></a>, Valve’s handheld console, brings PC gaming to your morning commute. The open question, of course, was how such a wee device would cope with the demanding, graphically intensive titles of the last few years. Valve’s Pierre-Loup Griffais explained that the console will ship with an option to limit the frame rate. This Frame Limiter, which has a lower limit of 30 frames per second, was tested on <em>Portal 2</em>, which lasted four hours without it, and six with. It seems like Valve is at least aware its handheld is more than a little ambitious and is making every effort to ensure it actually works. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-frame-rate-limiter-battery-life-180208866.html"><strong><ins>Continue Reading</ins></strong></a>.</p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/china-molten-salt-thorium-clean-nuclear-reactor-214210381.html"><ins>China plans to build the first &#39;clean&#39; commercial nuclear reactor</ins></a></h2><h3>Reactors using thorium and molten salt is the holy grail for clean energy visionaries.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/china-molten-salt-thorium-clean-nuclear-reactor-214210381.html "><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/a449c5a0-ed8a-11eb-bd7d-ff8315ccdec5" style="height:2000;width:3008;" alt="Thorium pellets.

This reactor, which uses thorium and molten salt, is a bit of a holy grail for our clean energy future, at least until something better comes along. Tests should begin later this year, and there’s hope of seeing the first working commercial reactor in the early 2030s. Developed by the US in the early ‘60s, thorium and molten salt reactors are comparable to current uranium reactors. Why was the technology mothballed? For a couple of reasons, most notably because, unlike uranium, the technology didn’t work for weapons. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/china-molten-salt-thorium-clean-nuclear-reactor-214210381.html"><strong><ins>Continue Reading</ins></strong></a>.</p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-1-mile-flown-201432109.html"><ins>NASA&#39;s Ingenuity helicopter has flown a total of one mile on Mars</ins></a></h2><h3>This is one air mile you can’t trade in for extra legroom.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-1-mile-flown-201432109.html "><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ec84f210-ed7e-11eb-bdff-d743be04de5f" style="height:1067;width:1600;" alt="NASA Ingenuity helicopter on 10th flight over Mars" data-uuid="7c5d81c7-47fa-3bcb-93de-aa42544a0a24"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">NASA/JPL-Caltech</div></figure></a><p>Ingenuity, NASA’s Mars helicopter, has now covered a mile of distance flown while studying the surface of the Red Planet.

The Korean company has <a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/07/new-additions-to-lg-tone-free-lineup-deliver-enhanced-performance-greater-convenience/">unveiled</a> its new range of LG Tone Free wireless earbuds, and this time the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-tone-free-hbs-fn6-hbs-fn4-180007320.html">germ-killing UV tech</a> isn&#39;t the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-02-lg-tone-plus-free.html">highlight</a>. Of the three newcomers, the high-end FP9 model has a charging case that plugs into a headphone jack to work as a Bluetooth dongle. The feature could be handy during flights and in other wired environments.&nbsp;</p><p>The trio, including the mid-range FP8 and low-end FP9, also come with active noise-canceling and two new spatial audio upgrades. That means you should hear musical elements as if they&#39;re positioned in different spaces in a 3D soundstage. The results are supposed to be more &quot;lifelike,&quot; according to LG, but we&#39;ll have to test them before offering a verdict.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/91ae1aa0-edfc-11eb-bd7f-506219aa5873" style="height:2537;width:2537;" alt="LG Tone Free FP" data-uuid="9e9c57ec-54ca-3b13-8220-5c2aa144a9e9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">LG</div></figure><p>In fact, spatial audio is becoming a more common feature in general.

While Verizon claims that its spatial audio format, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/verizon-adaptive-sound-spatial-audio-motorola-162018575.html">Adaptive Sound</a>, doesn&#39;t even require specific headphones, earbuds or speakers.</p><p>The big departure in the Tone Free&#39;s design is the shorter stem, which LG reduced by 4.4 millimeters. All three also pack a trio of microphones and a new voice calling feature, dubbed Whispering Mode, that lets you hold the right earbud close to your mouth as a dedicated mic.&nbsp;</p><p>UV auto-cleaning is back, too, but limited to the FP8 and FP9. It can get rid of 99.9 percent of germs in five minutes when the buds are placed inside the case, which features wireless charging on the FP8. Both the mid- and high-end earbuds also pack more battery life than the low-end- FP5: 10 hours of playback time compared to 8 hours between charges, and 24 hours with the case compared to 22 hours.&nbsp;</p><p>LG says the LG Tone Free FP series will be available starting this month in colors including charcoal black and pearl white, with the FP8 and FP9 also offered in haze gold.

As part of the latest neurological <a href="https://www.houstonmethodist.org/newsroom/investigational-magnetic-device-shrinks-glioblastoma-in-first-in-world-human-test/">breakthrough</a>, researchers used a helmet that generates a magnetic field to shrink a deadly tumor by a third. The 53-year-old patient who underwent the treatment ultimately passed away due to an unrelated injury. But, an autopsy of his brain showed that the procedure had removed 31 percent of the tumor mass in a short time. The test marked the first noninvasive therapy for a deadly form of brain cancer known as glioblastoma.</p><p>The helmet features three rotating magnets connected to a microprocessor-based electronic controller operated by a rechargeable battery. As part of the therapy, the patient wore the device for five weeks at a clinic and then at home with the help of his wife. The resulting magnetic field therapy created by the helmet was administered for two hours initially and then ramped up to a maximum of six hours per day. During the period, the patient&#39;s tumor mass and volume shrunk by nearly a third, with shrinkage appearing to correlate with the treatment dose.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The inventors of the device — which received FDA approval for compassionate use treatment — claim it could one day help treat brain cancer without radiation or chemotherapy. “Our results...open a new world of non-invasive and nontoxic therapy...with many exciting possibilities for the future,” said David S. Baskin, corresponding author and director of the Kenneth R. Peak Center for Brain and Pituitary Tumor Treatment in the Department of Neurosurgery at Houston Methodist Neurological Institute.

The next step is to make the system less computationally demanding and allow it work with onboard, rather than external cameras. &quot;This algorithm can have huge applications in package delivery with drones, inspection, search and rescue, and more,&quot; said UZH&#39;s head of Robotics and Perception Group, Davide Scaramuzza.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/autonomous-quadrotor-beats-two-human-pilots-in-a-drone-race-082912062.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">156ae482-733c-4381-a6af-7a87465a7e48</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jul 2021 08:29:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627277367</ingested><modified>2021-07-26T05:29:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/5d33a8b0-edcc-11eb-9f7b-8befd960b6b1" width="2000" height="1261" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/5d33a8b0-edcc-11eb-9f7b-8befd960b6b1" width="2000" height="1261" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Robotics and Perception Group, UZH]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Autonomous quadrotor beats two human pilots in a drone race]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Autonomous quadrotor beats two human pilots in a drone race]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Turtle Beach’s first gamepad pairs its audio expertise with great ergonomics]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Each gaming accessory company has one thing they do well, like Corsair and its keyboards or Razer’s line of mice. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/turtle%20beach">Turtle Beach</a> is known as a premium headset manufacturer, but that hasn’t stopped it from expanding its offerings, starting with its very first gamepad, the Recon Controller. And it happily still incorporates the company’s audio expertise.</p><p>It’s a wired controller compatible with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/xbox">Xbox</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-series-x-review-microsoft-140045437.html">Series X</a>|<a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-series-s-review-140027758.html">S</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-04-22-xbox-one-review-engadget.html">One</a> as well as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/windows%2010">Windows 10</a>. As a couch gamer I’m never really thrilled by the need to be tethered, but it makes up for it with a great hand feel. The grips are covered in a tactile gray material, with a grid of triangles that help channel heat and sweat away from your palms. But what I really like are the textured buttons — the shoulder, trigger and back buttons are studded with bumps that do a good job of keeping your fingers from slipping. They also feel great, so much so that I often find myself playing with the Recon Controller even when I’m not gaming.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/410ac220-ebee-11eb-ab06-215121f4c57c" alt="Turtle Beach Recon Controller in white with purple cord plugged in" data-uuid="1e64f919-3ca1-391d-b8c5-0c08f26690a1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>The marquee features of the Recon Controller are its audio controls, located in a small panel at the top of the gamepad. One of my editors said it looks like a modern interpretation of a Mad Catz unit and, well, he isn’t wrong. It’s not exactly attractive, with so many buttons it looks over-engineered.</p><p>What all those fiddly buttons offer is an array of options for the sound coming from the headset you’ve plugged into the controller. The bottom has the usual 3.5mm port, so it’ll work with pretty much any headset, provided you have the right cable for it. I tried it with the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Recon Spark" href="https://amzn.to/3BzRUW0">Recon Spark</a>, a solid and inexpensive set of cans that’s served as my daily driver at the office for a few years now.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2245e850-ebef-11eb-b627-c1bf24b421c6" alt="Turtle Beach Recon Controller in white" data-uuid="f354587e-1409-33c9-828e-4e875a0a702b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>At each end of the trapezoidal control panel are two toggles, the one on the left adjusts the volume and the right one handles the balance between game audio and chat. They’re far up enough on the controller such that you don’t accidentally hit the X and Y buttons. However, the buttons on the panel itself are packed in so tightly that if you overshoot you’re likely to hit one of the controls in the middle instead.</p><p>Which is less than ideal, given that the two big buttons are the mute function (not something you want to accidentally hit while communicating with your teammates) and the “superhuman hearing” button. The latter is a new feature, boosting smaller sounds like footsteps so you won’t miss a thing. The effect wasn’t as pronounced as it promises, as I didn’t notice huge changes while I played a few rounds of <em>Among Us</em>. But it certainly doesn’t hurt to have it, and the effect may vary depending on the game you’re playing and the headset you have connected.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/86a13df0-ebee-11eb-abfb-3f96e1539ab7" alt="Turtle Beach Recon Controller" data-uuid="9cac6c48-1b69-3035-a4b0-4cb2d10b0ea7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>Between those two buttons is another toggle, one that serves a variety of functions. You can adjust your EQ presets between the default, bass, bass/treble and vocal settings. You can also adjust the power of the gamepad’s vibrations, as well as the sensitivity of the thumb sticks. It’s nice to be able to adjust these things on the fly, rather than having to fiddle around in a settings program. The big drawback is that it’s not immediately clear what the icons represent, and I had to consult the instructions and experiment with them before I really understood.</p><p>Overall I was happy with the controller’s performance, and I’m enamored of the ergonomics of it more than anything. I’m just not entirely sure they’re worth dealing with a wired controller and headset when you’re used to going wireless.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/turtle-beach-recon-controller-gamepad-headset-070200364.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8c581349-0d87-471c-b454-355ac8ee8d92</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jul 2021 07:01:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627071561</ingested><modified>2021-07-23T20:19:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/1e7e0050-ebee-11eb-a79d-4316f0843180" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/1e7e0050-ebee-11eb-a79d-4316f0843180" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Kris Naudus / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Turtle Beach Recon Controller in white with white headset plugged into it]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Turtle Beach Recon Controller]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Researchers are testing concrete that could charge your EV while you drive]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Roads that can charge electric cars or buses while you drive <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-03-10-korea-starts-testing-recharging-road-might-make-it-part-of-it.html">aren&#39;t a new concept</a>, but so far the technology has been relatively expensive and inefficient.

They&#39;ll carry out the research in three phases, first testing if the magnetized cement (called &quot;magment,&quot; naturally) will work in the lab, then trying it out on a quarter-mile section of road.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In a <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:L9nlTT2EKmMJ:https://www.magment.de/en-downloads-blog/2019/9/03-magment-wireless-charging-broschure-iaa-edition+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=ca">brochure</a>, Magment said its product delivers &quot;record-breaking wireless transmission efficiency [at] up to 95 percent,&quot; adding that it can be built at &quot;standard road-building installation costs&quot; and that it&#39;s &quot;robust and vandalism-proof.&quot; The company also notes that slabs with the embedded ferrite particles could be built locally, presumably under license.&nbsp;</p><p>The final phase sounds ambitious, with INDOT saying it would &quot;test the innovative concrete’s capacity to charge heavy trucks operation at high power (200 kilowatts and above).&quot; If the final quarter-mile test track is a success, INDOT will use the tech to electrify an undermined segment of public interstate in Indiana.&nbsp;</p><p>Powering heavy trucks directly from the road without any pollution at an affordable price would be an environmental breakthrough, but there&#39;s still a lot of work to do to prove it works. Plenty of other similar efforts are underway, as the UK has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-08-11-under-road-wireless-charging.html">committed</a> around $780 million for under-road charging research, for example. Sweden has also tested <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-12-sweden-modified-road-recharge-electric-car-while-driving.html">slot-car like technology</a> that would contain an electrified &quot;rail&quot; embedded into roads.

There might be an impending solution. <em>LiveScience</em><a href="https://www.livescience.com/china-creates-new-thorium-reactor.html">reports</a> that China has outlined plans to build the first &#39;clean&#39; commercial nuclear reactor using liquid thorium and molten salt.</p><p>The first prototype reactor should be ready in August, with the first tests due in September. A full-scale commercial reactor should be ready by 2030.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The technology should not only be kinder to the environment, but mitigate some political controversy. Conventional uranium reactors produce waste that stays extremely radioactive for up to 10,000 years, requiring lead containers and extensive security. The waste also includes plutonium-239, an isotope crucial to nuclear weapons. They also risk spilling dramatic levels of radiation in the event of a leak, as seen in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-08-chernobyl-solar-plant.html">Chernobyl</a>. They also need large volumes of water, ruling out use in arid climates.</p><p>Thorium reactors, however, dissolve their key element into fluoride salt that mostly outputs uranium-233 you can recycle through other reactions. Other leftovers in the reaction have a half-life of &#39;just&#39; 500 years — still not spectacular, but much safer. If there is a leak, the molten salt cools enough that it effectively seals in the thorium and prevents significant leaks. The technology doesn&#39;t require water, and can&#39;t easily be used to produce nuclear weapons. You can build reactors in the desert, far away from most cities, and without raising concerns that it will add to nuclear weapon stockpiles.</p><p>China is accordingly building the first commercial reactor in Wuwei, a desert city in the country&#39;s Gansu province. Officials also see this as a way to foster China&#39;s international expansion — it plans up to 30 in countries participating in the company&#39;s &quot;Belt and Road&quot; investment initiative. In theory, China can extend its political influence without contributing to nuclear arms proliferation.</p><p>That might worry the US and other political rivals that are behind on thorium reactors. The US-based Natrium reactor, for instance, is still in development. Even so, it might go a long way toward fighting climate change and meeting China&#39;s goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2060. The country is still <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-26-china-raises-renewable-energy-target-to-reduce-coal.html">heavily dependent on coal energy</a>, and there&#39;s no guarantee renewable sources will keep up with demand by themselves. Thorium reactors could help China wean itself off coal relatively quickly, especially <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-05-ge-small-modular-nuclear-reactor.html">small-scale reactors</a> that could be built over shorter periods and fill gaps where larger plants would be excessive.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/china-molten-salt-thorium-clean-nuclear-reactor-214210381.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e473cca9-5adf-41a0-ac27-746f1a1f3daa</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jul 2021 21:42:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627249333</ingested><modified>2021-07-25T21:42:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nuclear Policy]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/a449c5a0-ed8a-11eb-bd7d-ff8315ccdec5" width="3008" height="2000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/a449c5a0-ed8a-11eb-bd7d-ff8315ccdec5" width="3008" height="2000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Pallava Bagla via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Thorium pellets.

While you probably won&#39;t run cutting-edge games at 30FPS with maximum detail (this is a $399 handheld, after all), you might not have to worry that a favorite game will be too choppy to play.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company already expects <em>Portal 2</em> to last for six hours at 30FPS versus four with no frame rate restrictions. We wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the effect is reduced for newer or more intensive games that are less likely to reach high frame rates.</p><p>The Steam Deck might not offer a completely seamless experience even with the limiter. <em>Digital Foundry</em><a href="https://twitter.com/digitalfoundry/status/1419294962655576066">warned</a> that you might get a less-than-ideal experience with V-Sync active. And of course, the 30FPS target generally applies only to existing games — don&#39;t count on a cutting-edge 2023 game running at playable frame rates, at least not without significantly reduced detail. This is more about ensuring that your existing game library is usable on launch.</p><div id="f6153a8a13f442e9ad1bde8680a6d49c"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The &quot;30 FPS target&quot; refers to the floor of what we consider playable in our performance testing; games we&#39;ve tested and shown have consistently met and exceeded that bar so far.

OnLeaks and <em>Pricebaba</em> have <a href="https://pricebaba.com/blog/motorola-edge-20-renders-exclusive">shared</a> what they say are CAD-based renders of the standard Edge 20, and Motorola appears to have dropped the highly curved &quot;endless&quot; display in favor of a 6.7-inch flat screen.

An Edge 20 Lite is supposedly in the works as well. If Motorola does use this design for the mainstream Edge 20, though, it signals a change of tack. Rather than relying on an eye-catching (if somewhat impractical) design for the entire Edge line, it would focus on delivering value for the money. It&#39;s just a question of whether or not the price will be low enough to draw you away from rivals.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/motorola-edge-20-image-leak-164229916.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">83922f2c-4aee-408c-b203-711c5ab2dd33</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jul 2021 16:42:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627270338</ingested><modified>2021-07-26T03:32:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/44253880-ed62-11eb-b117-cdbee277c91a" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/44253880-ed62-11eb-b117-cdbee277c91a" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[OnLeaks/Pricebaba]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Motorola Edge 20 leak]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Motorola Edge 20 leak]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Las Vegas police solve an old murder case using record-low volume of DNA]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Las Vegas police appear to have smashed a record while <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-28-police-using-ancestry-site-cold-case-suspects.html">using ancestry to find cold case suspects</a>. <em>BBC News</em><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57947785">reports</a> that Vegas law enforcement <a href="https://www.lvmpd.com/en-us/Press%20Releases/PO%20157%2007-21-21.pdf">claims</a> to have solved the 1989 murder of 14-year-old Stephanie Isaacson (pictured here) using the smallest known volume of DNA. Investigators sent just 0.12 nanograms of DNA samples, or about 15 cells, to Othram&#39;s gene sequencing lab to help find a match. For context, a typical <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-28-23andme-expands-ancestry-region-coverage.html">home DNA testing kit</a> collects at least 750 nanograms.</p><p>Othram used the sequences to comb through ancestry databases and pinpoint the suspect&#39;s cousin and identify Darren Roy Marchand as the culprit.

Marchand was never convicted and died in 1995.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Vegas police launched the investigation after resident Justin Woo donated money to help law enforcement solve cases using &quot;minimal&quot; DNA levels.

As you won&#39;t find a charging station in the middle of the desert, however, Audi uses a race-ready TFSI engine as part of an energy converter that charges the battery while driving and braking. This isn&#39;t a zero-emissions car, then, but it stays in a relatively efficient power band (between 4,500RPM and 6,000RPM) that should reduce the racer&#39;s environmental impact.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The machine should be highly adaptable, too. Unlike many EVs, the front and rear axles aren&#39;t mechanically connected — software handles torque distribution instead. That not only allows for an easily reconfigurable center differential, but saves the bulk that would normally be used for a conventional differential and propshaft.</p><p>Audi plans to enter the machine into multiple cross-country rallies in 2021 before participating in the Dakar Rally in January.</p><p>If Audi is successful, the RS Q E-Tron will make a stronger case for eco-friendly endurance racing. While not a pure EV, it will handle extremely long stages (up to 500 miles) with a significantly reduced emissions footprint. It also won&#39;t surprise you to hear that Audi wants more than just bragging rights. It expects lessons learned from the car to reach production cars. We wouldn&#39;t count on something with a similar drivetrain when the VW group is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vw-ev-sales-2030-target-153212862.html">transitioning to EVs</a>, but it&#39;s easy to imagine <a href="https://www.engadget.com/preview-2020-01-15-audi-etron-review.html">electric SUVs</a> and crossovers that are better-suited to off-roading.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/audi-rs-q-e-tron-2022-dakar-rally-163605282.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f4997ee3-e262-4b19-80b8-ae067a9582eb</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jul 2021 16:36:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627144567</ingested><modified>2021-07-24T16:36:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d3082cf0-ec96-11eb-affe-66001e6b7813" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d3082cf0-ec96-11eb-affe-66001e6b7813" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Audi]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Audi RS Q e-tron]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Audi RS Q e-tron]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hitting the Books: Digital youth activism can help save America from itself]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Social media routinely proves itself a cesspool of racist, bigoted and toxic opinions — and that&#39;s just coming from the adults.

I think deep down we all believe this and want it to be true. But there are many elements of our society that are set up to communicate the opposite message. Much of school is designed in a way that tells our kids that they are to apply the skills they are learning some day in their hypothetical future, not now. They are taught to learn math because they will need it to get into college. They are taught to write because it will be an important skill when they get a job. In history, the people they learn about are always adults, not kids. They have little choice or control over the learning experience itself; they are handed a schedule, given assignments (that they didn’t have any input in designing), and told to complete by a date that they didn’t choose. The message that young voices don’t matter is reinforced by the fact that they can’t vote until they are eighteen. One of the most important tenets of democracy is the idea that everyone has a voice. We teach that to our children, yet we offer very few ways to actually use that voice before they’re no longer kids. Fortunately, the digital world gives a wide set of tools that can help change that narrative. These tools allow youth to have a voice and learn how to make a meaningful impact on their community, family, and in some cases, the world as a whole—right now, not decades down the road.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Just Some Students from Florida</em></p><p>In February 2018, Marjory Stoneman High School in Parkland, Florida, was in the news worldwide when nineteen-year-old Nikolas Cruz entered the school with a semiautomatic rifle, killing seventeen people and injuring seventeen others. This horrific event became one of the deadliest school shootings in US history. Yet there was a unique ending to this tragic story that set it apart for another reason. In other school shootings, traditional news media and political leaders quickly shape the national conversation around the event. A narrative emerges around what actually happened, with speculation about the causes, who is to blame, and the political responses to justify action (or lack thereof). But in the case of Parkland, it was the students who shaped the national conversation. Frustrated about viewpoints and conclusions from adults that they did not share or agree with, they used their access to social media to reset and redirect the conversation into what has now become one of the most powerful examples of youth engagement ever seen. Within a week of the shooting, the students had appeared on nearly every major news program and had raised more than $3 million in donations to support their cause. Emma Gonzáles, one of the most recognizable faces of the movement, has over 1.5 million Twitter followers—about twice as many as the National Rifle Association.&nbsp;</p><p>Not long after the shooting, I met Diane Wolk-Rogers, a history teacher at Stoneman High School. As she explained, nobody could have prepared these students for the horror they faced on that day. But they had been prepared to know how to use technology to make their voices heard. Wolk-Rogers says, “They are armed with incredible communication skills and a sense of citizenship that I find so inspiring.” So when it was time to act, they knew the tools of the trade.&nbsp;</p><p>Engaged digital citizens know how to use technology to identify and propose solutions and promote action around causes that are important to them and their communities. Micro-activism is a term used to describe small-scale efforts that, when combined, can bring about significant change. While young people might not be able to vote or run for office, they have a whole range of micro-activism opportunities—all made possible by their participation in the digital world. For youth who have access to social media, micro-activism can be as simple as using their digital platforms to call awareness to issues that matter to them—eradicating racism, protecting our planet, or funding their school, and so on. Most states have a function on their website to submit ideas or feedback directly to the office of the governor. Through sites like Change.org anyone, regardless of age, can submit suggestions to political leaders or private sector entities. You can also add your name in support of other petitions that are gaining momentum. There are many compelling stories of youth who have used Change.org to call attention to issues that matter to them. Examples include a ten-year-old who used the platform to convince Jamba Juice to switch from Styrofoam cups to a more environmentally friendly alternative. Or a seventh grader who used Change.org to successfully petition the Motion Picture Association to change the rating on a movie about school bullying so students in her junior high would be allowed to see it.</p><p>Not all acts of micro-activism will immediately result in a desired change. But regardless of the outcome, learning how to impact community issues using digital tools is an important skill to develop in and of itself. The ability to motivate others to act for good in a virtual space will be a significant (if not the significant) determining factor in the effectiveness of future civic leaders. Young people need to practice using tech to make a difference now, if they are going to be prepared to lead our society when they grow up.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-digital-for-good-richard-culatta-harvard-business-press-153034423.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cf227f78-6942-4b20-9367-e9796d552720</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jul 2021 15:30:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626721806</ingested><modified>2021-07-19T19:10:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Career & Education]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-04/a3538f80-7f38-11ea-92b6-9f9d6ac036d8" width="3500" height="2359" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-04/a3538f80-7f38-11ea-92b6-9f9d6ac036d8" width="3500" height="2359" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jonathan Ernst / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Emma Gonzalez, a student and shooting survivor from the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, cries as she addresses the conclusion of the "March for Our Lives" event demanding gun control after recent school shootings at a rally in Washington, U.S., March 24, 2018.

The always-on display is still very helpful, and on Series 6 is brighter to help you see it during outdoor expeditions. It&#39;s slightly faster, lasts slightly longer on battery and charges quickly.  We&#39;d add that the Apple Watch remains the go-to wristwear for iPhone users between the tight integration, deep app ecosystem and wide range of bands and accessories.</p><p>Timing is the main concern at this point. It&#39;s no secret that the Series 6 is nearly a year old, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-leak-and-body-temperature-132421478.html">Series 7</a> is likely just a couple of months away. If money isn&#39;t your main concern, it might be worth waiting for the updated hardware. With that said, the Series 7 likely won&#39;t see discounts like this for a long while — the Series 6 is still a good value if you either can&#39;t afford to wait or just want a full-featured Apple Watch at the lowest possible price.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-6-product-red-amazon-sale-151433869.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d9969c6e-0305-4c74-a3f3-9748a64b27bc</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jul 2021 15:14:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627139676</ingested><modified>2021-07-24T15:14:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c55fd260-ec8c-11eb-b7af-fcf1d94f9d2c" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c55fd260-ec8c-11eb-b7af-fcf1d94f9d2c" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple Watch Series 6 Product Red with Count Up face]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Watch Series 6 Product Red with Count Up face]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Engadget Podcast: Is the Valve Steam Deck a Switch killer?]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week on the show, Devindra and Engadget Buyer’s Guide Editor Kris Naudus chat about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-181222143.html">Valve’s new Steam Deck</a> portable with <a href="https://twitter.com/JordanWMinor?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Jordan Minor</a>, <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/authors/jordan-minor">Apps and Games Analyst at PCMag</a>.

The show is set in Los Angeles in the year 2032, putting its events in between the original Harrison Ford movie set in 2019 and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-20-designing-the-technology-of-blade-runner-2049.html">sequel film</a> starring Ryan Gosling set in 2049. It features a new replicant named Elle known as the &quot;Black Lotus,&quot; who was created with special powers. She seems to have escaped from her creators, and is currently being hunted down by authorities.</p><p>In the action-packed trailer, you&#39;ll see Elle take down foe after foe — she goes from not knowing how she&#39;s able to knock a handful of men completely out cold to wielding a katana — in a backdrop of smoke, fog and neon lights. Elle is voiced by Jessica Henwick (<em>Iron Fist</em>) in the English version and Arisa Shida in the Japanese version. The show will run for 13 episodes, which will be directed by Shinji Aramaki (<em>Ultraman</em>, <em>Ghost in the Shell: SAC 2045</em>) and Kenji Kamiyama (<em>Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, SAC_2045</em>).

The agency has been planning to send a probe to the Jovian moon for years and finalized its plans in 2019. In its <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-awards-launch-services-contract-for-europa-clipper-mission">announcement</a>, NASA said the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-20-nasa-confirms-europa-mission.html">Europa Clipper</a> spacecraft is scheduled to launch in October 2024 on top of a Falcon Heavy rocket from Kennedy Space Center&#39;s Launch Complex 39A. It has also revealed that the contract will cost the agency approximately $178 million — a bargain, compared to what it would&#39;ve cost to launch the mission on top of NASA&#39;s Space Launch System rocket.</p><p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/07/spacex-to-launch-the-europa-clipper-mission-for-a-bargain-price/"><em>Ars Technica</em></a> notes, Congress originally urged NASA to use the SLS to launch the Europa Clipper. At the time, though, the White House <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/11/the-white-house-puts-a-price-on-the-sls-rocket-and-its-a-lot/">estimated</a> a single SLS launch to cost a whopping $2 billion. Far from ideal, especially since the SLS would need gravity assist from Venus and travel farther to be able to reach its goal, whereas the Falcon Heavy wouldn&#39;t. In addition, NASA told Ars that the SLS would need $1 billion worth of additional modifications to be able to complete the mission.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If Europa Clipper launches in October 2024 as planned, it will reach Jupiter&#39;s orbit in April 2030. The probe will then investigate whether the icy moon truly has conditions suitable for life. It&#39;ll capture &quot;high-resolution images of Europa&#39;s surface, determine its composition, look for signs of recent or ongoing geological activity, measure the thickness of the moon&#39;s icy shell, search for subsurface lakes, and determine the depth and salinity of Europa&#39;s ocean.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/spacex-europa-clipper-mission-jupiters-040804303.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9f30abd6-acff-437c-b961-333898c87d25</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jul 2021 04:08:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627099752</ingested><modified>2021-07-24T04:09:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/16ef02c0-ec30-11eb-bdf7-5cb0d5a8dd26" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/16ef02c0-ec30-11eb-bdf7-5cb0d5a8dd26" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NASA/JPL-Caltech]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Europa Clipper]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Europa Clipper]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Relaxing behind the wheel of Mercedes’ level 3 autonomous Drive Pilot]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="fa52da2fee39442e9e91117e63beb39f"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5TWKFHsvseo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>The dream of autonomous driving everywhere is still a long way away. But soon Mercedes will launch Drive Pilot, its level 3 autonomous driving system in Germany on the S-Class and EQS. We had a chance to try the system out at the automaker’s test track and, while it did what it was supposed to do, we found it hard to turn off our driving brain while behind the wheel.</p><p>The system works on highways in traffic at speeds up to 60 kph (37 mph). Essentially it’s for daily commuting. But during that time the driver can stop paying attention and the Mercedes is responsible for everything that happens. That’s not to say you can nap, the vehicle still tracks the driver with an in-car monitor and it requires the driver to take over when it’s about to go faster than 37 mph, an emergency vehicle shows up, it rains or other situations that the vehicle is not built to handle. But you can play Tetris and text people. So that’s fun.

The EQS will land in dealers this fall at a yet-to-be-announced price point and, when it does, it’ll take on offerings from Tesla and Porsche. How will it fare against these EVs? We had a chance to drive the 2021 EQS for two days and figure out how it stacks up not just against competitors but up against the S-Class itself.</p><p>On our drive we got time behind the 450+ with rear-wheel drive, the 580 4Matic with all-wheel drive, and the Edition One version with its two-tone paint and 580 4Matic powerplant. All vehicles have a 107.8 kWh capacity battery pack and on the WLTP range test, the vehicle is rated at 485 miles. Of course, the more stringent EPA testing needs to be done and that number should fall. For now, we have a drive and impressions while we wait for range estimates and pricing.

Following a <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/commercialcrew/2021/07/22/flight-readiness-concludes-for-boeings-orbital-flight-test-2/">flight readiness review</a>, NASA is moving forward with the craft’s upcoming July 30th uncrewed orbital flight test. Unless there’s an unforeseen delay, the capsule will launch from the Space Force’s Cape Canaveral Station mounted on an Atlas V rocket at 2:53PM ET. Should NASA postpone the flight, it will again attempt to carry out the test on August 3rd at the earliest.</p><p>The purpose of the flight is for NASA to conduct an end-to-end test of Starliner’s capabilities. It wants to know if the capsule can handle every aspect of a trip to the ISS, including launch, docking as well as atmospheric re-entry. “[Orbital Flight Test-2] will provide valuable data that will help NASA certify Boeing’s crew transportation system to carry astronauts to and from the space station,” the agency said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If the flight is a success, NASA will move forward with a crewed test of the Starliner. Steve Stich, commercial crew program manager at NASA, said that could happen “as soon as later this year.” Both Boeing and NASA have a lot invested in the viability of Starliner.
