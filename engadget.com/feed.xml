These are not official reviews; they’re simply our first-hand experiences. This week, Senior Editor Devindra Hardawar dives into Yale’s Assure smart lock.</em></p><hr><p>What if you could go through life without worrying about carrying your keys and potentially being locked out of the house? That&#39;s something I&#39;ve always dreamed of, but it wasn&#39;t possible when I was renting in Brooklyn. These days, though, I&#39;ve got a bit more freedom in my own home outside of Atlanta. And now that my wife and I are also responsible for a precocious three-year-old, we figured it was a good time to move away from the tyranny of house keys. The last thing we need is to be locked out during a potty emergency.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You&#39;ve got a few different options: electronic locks with key pads or biometrics, or smart ones that can be controlled via apps. Initially, we were turned off by the latter. Given just how finicky connected devices are plus the potential for remote hacking, app-controlled locks just didn&#39;t seem worth the trouble. So we opted for a well-rated electronic lock with a touchscreen pin pad: <a href="https://amzn.to/3ktxmqY"><ins>Yale&#39;s Assure Lock</ins></a>. It&#39;s a sturdy Grade 2 deadbolt with a key slot, which is helpful if the battery runs out. It also <a href="https://amzn.to/3kvIyDG"><ins>has an upgrade port for turning it into an August smart lock</ins></a> down the line. (Spoiler: that turned out to be very useful.)</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/0b02f441-4625-11ec-9cef-691f1a35c4e6" style="height:1136;width:2000;" alt="Yale Assure Lock" data-uuid="4dea7d79-d415-3c6d-9afc-5b9fb6a1d996"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Installing the Assure Lock on our front door entailed the same process as any other deadbolt. We removed the old lock, installed the included strike plate and took care to make sure the Assure aligned with our door frame properly. It took a bit of fiddling, but eventually my wife was able to wiggle it into place. (And here&#39;s where I&#39;ll admit that my role in this installation process came mostly in the form of cheerleading, instruction-reading and drink-fetching. I&#39;m the tech guy; my wife enjoys getting her hands dirty with house projects whenever possible.)</p><p>Setting up our PIN was a bit more cumbersome, since it involved <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_5zM2-u_eU&amp;t=125s"><ins>following very specific instructions</ins></a> from Yale. It&#39;s not tough, but it&#39;s not exactly intuitive either. I immediately dreaded having to repeat that process whenever we need to set up guest codes. Once we had everything configured, the Assure Lock worked like a charm. I could run to the park with my daughter without fretting about keys, and punching in numbers was simple enough that she was eager to help out. (Gotta get that math training in whenever possible, right?)</p><p>While the Assure’s design didn’t bother me much, it’s definitely larger than most deadbolt facades. It practically announces itself as a high tech gadget. Partially, that’s because it still has room for a traditional key. Yale’s <a href="https://amzn.to/3D5CU2l"><ins>Assure Lock SL</ins></a> omits that entirely, and is therefore more compact. So if your aesthetics don’t align with mine, don’t worry, you have options.</p><p>Even though the Assure worked well as a keypad lock, I still couldn&#39;t help but feel the pull towards something smarter. I wanted an easier way to open our front door remotely while we were playing in the backyard. And I realized it&#39;d be useful to know if the lock was open or not from my phone, something that would come in handy whenever we had a cat sitter visiting while we were away. So within a week, we installed <a href="https://amzn.to/3Hal9kZ"><ins>Yale&#39;s smart lock upgrade kit</ins></a> and never looked back.</p><p>We still use the Assure&#39;s keypad most of the time, but it&#39;s been genuinely helpful having a bit more connectivity. Now I can easily change guest codes on the fly, and being able to confirm it&#39;s closed remotely is a much needed balm for my anxious dad brain. We&#39;ve avoided activating Alexa integration — voice control seems like an unnecessary security risk — and we haven&#39;t yet connected the Assure to our HomeKit setup. Once we do, though, we’ll be able to see the Yale Lock alongside <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arlo-video-doorbell-pro-3-irl-150052184.html"><ins>our Arlo cameras</ins></a> on a single screen.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/0b01bbc0-4625-11ec-9f36-499846b235e6" style="height:1170;width:2000;" alt="Yale Assure Lock" data-uuid="043a7898-41ee-3945-b403-85a2435f695b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Despite living the smart lock life, I can understand why many people still find them untrustworthy. If there&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve learned about smart home tech over the years, it&#39;s that it can all be pretty dumb at times. Security flaws may pop up, the connectivity may fail. But when it comes to security,  I&#39;m not too worried about someone trying to hack into my home.&nbsp;</p><p>But even if you don&#39;t want a connected lock, it&#39;s still worth upgrading to an electronic lock with a keypad. After loving the convenience of the Yale Assure so much, we added a simpler model to a rear door, which was a huge help while doing yardwork. Just think about the last time you were locked out. Or, if you&#39;ve somehow been blessed never to experience that, imagine how annoying being locked out in the cold can be. Maybe it happens at the end of a long day, or at a point when you just <em>really </em>need to use the bathroom. If you had an electronic lock, you&#39;d be inside your home already.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/yale-assure-smart-lock-gadget-irl-153534460.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9f9b0149-556b-468e-a053-b03efd277c2e</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 15 Nov 2021 15:35:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636990543</ingested><modified>2021-11-15T15:35:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/0b02f440-4625-11ec-bffb-321cb42cd6b9" width="2000" height="1265" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/0b02f440-4625-11ec-bffb-321cb42cd6b9" width="2000" height="1265" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Yale Assure Lock]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Yale Assure Lock]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Take-Two buys 'OlliOlli World' developer Roll7]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Take-Two/"><ins>Take-Two Interactive</ins></a>, the owner of Rockstar Games and 2K, has added another studio to its roster. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/roll7/"><ins>Roll7</ins></a>, the small team behind the OlliOlli skateboarding series, is <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/news-releases/news-release-details/private-division-acquires-developer-roll7"><ins>joining</ins></a> the company&#39;s Private Division publishing label.</p><p>Private Division will release Roll7&#39;s next game, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/olliolli-world-preview-interview-e3-160000184.html"><em><ins>OlliOlli World</ins></em></a>, which was supposed to arrive by the end of the year but has now been delayed until the first quarter of 2022.

Ever since the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-85t-review-130035415.html">Elite 85t</a> came out, we&#39;ve seen the 75t oscillate in price — but Best Buy has them for only $80 right now, which is the best price we&#39;ve seen. It&#39;s one of the retailer&#39;s deals of the day, so you&#39;ll have to grab them today to get the discount before the price goes up tomorrow.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/vnQg6e" id="29b0cff8bdbf439ca0c37c806ad5cfb1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Best Buy;elmt:impactRadius;pdid:">Buy Jabra Elite 75t at Best Buy - $80</a><p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-23-jabra-elite-75t-review-specs-features.html">Elite 75t</a> have always been a good option if you didn&#39;t want to pay the premium that comes with devices like Apple&#39;s AirPods Pro or even competitors from Bose and Sony. The 75t are small and comfortable, and they&#39;re IP55-rated design means you can wear them while exercising without worrying. Each bud has one button for onboard controls, but they do a lot including adjust volume, turn on HearThrough transparency mode, skip tracks, mute mics when you&#39;re on a call and more. The buds have solid audio that packs a punch and, after the Elite 85t came out, Jabra updated the 75t with active noise cancelling through a firmware update. That was one of the biggest features previously missing on the 75t, and the addition of it makes these buds even more like the 85ts than they were before.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You&#39;ll get roughly 6.5 hours on a single charge of the Elite 75t, plus the extra juice its charging case holds. One thing that&#39;s exclusive to the 85t earbuds is wireless charging, so you&#39;ll have to opt for the more expensive model if you must have that feature. Luckily, the 85t are on sale right now as well for <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$150" href="https://amzn.to/3Dlpuzc">$150</a> — that&#39;s their lowest price ever, but still almost double the cost of the 75t right now. If you&#39;re able to snag them today, Jabra&#39;s Elite 75t are a steal for anyone in need of a new pair of wireless ANC buds.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

It&#39;s moving forward with at least one of them, an autonomous vehicle that can go off road. Honda and engineering company Black &amp; Veatch have been putting the second-gen Autonomous Work Vehicle (AWV) through its paces at a solar panel construction site.</p><p>This was the first field test in which several AWVs were working together. The vehicles towed trailers and carried construction materials, water and other supplies across the 1,000-acre worksite. The AWV can carry a payload of up to 399kg (880 pounds) and tow a trailer with a total weight of 750kg (1,653 pounds).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In a video that shows off the AWVs, a Black &amp; Veatch employee notes that it can take a while to travel across such a large site. So loading up the vehicles with materials and sending them to another location can make things more efficient and cut down on employees&#39; travel time, freeing them up to work on other things.</p><div id="546f567fbb9f4fe6b351ed05b38d5d4d"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BRtGYnBNG7U?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/honda/">Honda</a> created a high-definition map of the site so operators could set start and end points for the AWVs. It says the vehicles stopped within centimeters of their destinations. Along with operating autonomously, the AWV can be remotely controlled.</p><p>The company claims the vehicle can run for up to eight hours on a single charge, even in a high-temperature environment. The AWV uses a number of sensors for navigation, including GPS, radar and LiDAR, as well as 3D cameras for remote monitoring. Honda says that even with a maximum payload capacity, the AWV has a range of up to 27.9 miles, depending on the use case.</p><p>The automaker is aiming to improve the performance and design of the AMV as it iterates on the prototype (it looks kinda cute as is). It might offer the ability to add attachments and tools as well. Honda hasn&#39;t revealed plans to release a commercial version of the AMV just yet, though.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/honda-autonomous-work-vehicle-demo-021556762.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">582f08ac-3aa1-472a-beb9-d9fb70c6f2eb</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 15 Nov 2021 14:15:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636986848</ingested><modified>2021-11-15T14:34:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/0198f7f0-4621-11ec-b3da-154bd068d35b" width="1855" height="1125" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/0198f7f0-4621-11ec-b3da-154bd068d35b" width="1855" height="1125" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Honda]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Honda's new 'Autonomous Work Vehicle' parked on the side of a dirt road.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Honda 'Autonomous Work Vehicle']]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[TD Pilot will let people with disabilities control iPads with their eyes]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-os-15-public-beta-preview-191514417.html">plenty new in iPadOS 15</a>, but it also features an under-sung accessibility upgrade: support for third-party eye-tracking devices. That&#39;ll allow people with disabilities to use iPad apps and speech generation software simply through eye movements — no touchscreen interaction required. Tobii Dynavox, the assistive tech division of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-13-tobii-vr-eye-tracking.html">eye-tracking company Tobii</a>, worked with Apple for years to help make that happen. And now, the firm is ready to announce TD Pilot, a device that aims to bring the iPad experience to the estimated 50 million people globally who need communication assistance.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="1b92b976-ec30-43e2-a8a4-0a73dc54fcc7"/><p>The TD Pilot is basically a super-powered frame for Apple&#39;s tablets: It can fit in something as big as the iPad Pro 12.9-inch, and it also packs in large speakers, an extended battery and a wheelchair mount. It&#39;s thankfully water and dust-resistant, so it&#39;ll survive time in a rainstorm or even a user&#39;s shower.  There&#39;s also a secondary &quot;Partner Window&quot; on the back that spells out what a TD Pilot user is saying, which aims to make conversation feel more natural. Most importantly, though, it features Tobii Dynavox&#39;s latest eye-tracking sensor, which is powerful enough to work in bright sunlight.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="9281512adf654436955e43639e52c4d8"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nfZ0ntD4grQ?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>This isn&#39;t exactly new territory for the company: It&#39;s been producing <a href="https://www.tobiidynavox.com/pages/i-series-ap">popular Windows-powered assistive devices</a> for years. But, as CEO Fredrik Ruben tells Engadget, TD Pilot gives users with disabilities the same sort of flexibility that the non-disabled have. Some may not need the full power of a Windows PC, or maybe they&#39;d just rather deal with the simpler interface on an iPad. TD Pilot users will also be able use eye tracking to play some iPadOS games—so long as they don&#39;t require extremely rapid movement.</p><p>While Tobii Dynavox is the current market leader in eye-tracking solutions, a smaller company ended up delivering iPad support first. <a href="https://www.inclusivetlc.com/skyle-for-ipad-pro">Inclusive Technology&#39;s Skyle</a> launched last year, and it allows for gaze control by tapping into the iPad&#39;s Assistive Touch feature. That was originally meant for mice and other input devices. Consequently, Ruben claims that technique is more like emulated tracking, since it involves staring at a cursor to move it around. Still,<a href="http://products%20for%20pals%20-%20als%20tech/"> a short review</a> from the YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Y80QSdvJ1cdOyZRM73U3A">Products for pALS</a> was pretty favorable (and also had some less kind things to say about Tobii Dynavox&#39;s dated software).</p><div id="76b1c54459ef4f7baf9762dc009c474e"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_3TxZtDJpFo?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Skyle&#39;s $2,995 price may also be another advantage if your insurance doesn&#39;t cover TD Pilot. Ruben tells us that Tobii Dynavox has around 400 insurance contracts already, and its devices are already covered by Medicare and Medicaid. Without insurance, though, the total cost of the TD Pilot could run up to $10,000, not including the cost of the iPad. Part of that cost would also go towards getting the device set up, as well as paying for Tobii Dynavox&#39;s software.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/87f54260-45d9-11ec-b4ff-7590094181a4" alt="A screen showing the TD Pilot iPad software" data-uuid="90498393-36d2-3ee5-9e31-8d6b973ac735"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tobii Dynavox</div></figure><p>When I tried out <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-13-tobii-vr-eye-tracking.html">Tobii&#39;s eye-tracking technology in VR</a> a few years ago, it felt like a superpower. I could hit a far-off target with a rock simply by focusing on it. It&#39;s not hard to see how useful that technology could be with an iPad for users with disabilities. Last year, we said that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/accessibility-in-tech-2020-150002855.html">assistive technology still had a long way to go</a>, despite a bit of progress from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-17-xbox-adaptive-controller-disabilities-gamepad-microsoft-tour.html">companies like Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-assistant-snap-core-first-accessibility-174254953.html">Google</a>. So, at the least, it&#39;s heartening to see another solution pop up—especially one that forced Apple to open up its restrictive ecosystem in the name of accessibility.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/td-pilot-ipad-eye-tracking-tobii-dynavox-140046055.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5c4b780a-8e58-4242-b197-4d470d023cf9</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 15 Nov 2021 14:00:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636986624</ingested><modified>2021-11-15T14:30:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/87f6a1f0-45d9-11ec-bdb7-92aa3919f8c5" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/87f6a1f0-45d9-11ec-bdb7-92aa3919f8c5" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tobii Dynavox]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A Tobii Dynavox's user with a TD Pilot attached to her wheelchair.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tobii Dynavox's TD Pilot eye tracker for iPads]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Adobe discounts Creative Cloud plans by 40 percent for Black Friday]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#39;ve been contemplating whether to purchase a subscription to Adobe&#39;s Creative Cloud plan, now is time to do so.

You can grab the cans for $279 right now, or $50 off their normal price. That&#39;s the best price we&#39;ve seen in the short time these headphones have been available, so now&#39;s a good time to get them if you&#39;ve had your eye on a new pair of headphones or if someone on your gift list could use them.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3Dno7Ab" id="4bf5941782e54770acdc88026724cfe8" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Bose QuietComfort 45 at Amazon - $279</a><p>Bose&#39;s QuietComfort lineup is beloved for many reasons and the company didn&#39;t try to reinvent the wheel here. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-quietcomfort-45-review-143031637.html">QC45</a> look very similar to the QC35 that came before it. We recommend the Bose 700 if you&#39;re looking for a striking pair of headphones, but the QC45, while not the slickest, are super comfortable to wear for hours on end. The physical buttons for onboard controls let you play/pause, take calls, skip tracks and adjust the volume, plus switch between active noise cancellation and ambient sound mode. Notably, Bose nixed the micro-USB charging port and opted for a more modern USB-C port on these cans.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Sound quality and ANC are as good as you&#39;d expect on a pair of Bose headphones. Audio is clear and balanced and ANC is even better than it was before. QuietComfort devices have been some of the best you can get if you want to block out the world, and Bose managed to improve upon it even more in the QC45 with the help of multiple microphones that work with a &quot;proprietary digital chip&quot; to detect and silence more mid-range frequencies. That means it&#39;ll quell the roar of the commuter train you may be riding along with the voices of colleagues on Zoom calls right next to you.</p><p>Bose promises up to 24 hours of battery life on a single charge and we got around 22.5 hours in our testing. That means you&#39;ll be able to keep these cans on all day long if you want and still have some juice leftover at the end of a work day. As solid as these headphones are, they do have a few flaws. We mentioned their somewhat boring design, but that&#39;s easy to overlook thanks to the QC45&#39;s comfort level. You can&#39;t adjust EQ yourself, but the cans have volume-optimized Active EQ feature that adjusts highs and lows automatically. They also have a feature that lets you connect them to your phone and laptop at the same time, but they don&#39;t automatically reconnect to your second device after taking a call from your phone. It&#39;s a small issue, but one that&#39;s amplified when you consider other headphones in this price range do this automatically. However, if you&#39;re looking for the best that Bose has to offer — especially in the ANC department — this deal on the QC45 is one to consider.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

There are a lot of improvements to the company’s own apps, from FaceTime through Safari, and Apple Maps continues to close in on Google Maps.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ios-15-review-150030599.html https://www.engadget.com/..."><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/gucci-xbox-series-x-224813032.html https://www.engadget.com/...">Gucci made an Xbox Series X for the one percent</a></h2><h3>If you have $10,000 lying around, you can get one on November 17th.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/gucci-xbox-series-x-224813032.html https://www.engadget.com/..."><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/bba498f0-4605-11ec-9ddf-75011abc23c0" style="height:506;width:675;" alt="The Morning After" data-uuid="e800e60a-ca18-3bd5-8469-cb8b1f6e6c39"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Gucci</div></figure></a><p>Italian fashion house Gucci is releasing a special edition Xbox Series X that will cost an eye-watering $10,000.

Now, Apple has offered to pay $30 million to settle the suit and lawyers for the employees have urged them to accept it, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/11/13/apple-to-pay-30m-to-retail-employees-for-off-the-clock-bag-device-searches"><em>Apple Insider</em></a> has reported. &quot;This is a significant, non-reversionary settlement reached after nearly eight years of hard-fought litigation,&quot; wrote plaintiff attorney Lee Shalov in the proposed settlement seen by <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/apple-to-pay-30-million-to-employees-subjected-to-off-the-clock-searches/"><em>Courthouse News</em></a>.</p><p>Employees launched the suit way back in 2013, saying they weren&#39;t paid while being searched for stolen merchandise or trade secrets. The workers felt they were still under Apple&#39;s &quot;control&quot; during that five to 20 minute process and should therefore be compensated.

There, the judges ruled that Apple workers were &quot;clearly under Apple&#39;s control while awaiting, and during, the exit searches.&quot; The court dismissed Apple&#39;s argument that bringing a bag to work was an employee convenience, particularly that Apple felt employees didn&#39;t necessarily need to bring their iPhones to work.</p><p>&quot;Its characterization of the iPhone as unnecessary for its own employees is directly at odds with its description of the iPhone as an &#39;integrated and integral&#39; part of the lives of everyone else,&quot; the judges wrote. In that statement, the court referenced a 2017 Tim Cook interview where he stated that the iPhone was &quot;so so integrated and integral to our lives, you wouldn&#39;t think about leaving home without it.&quot;</p><p>The settlement is still subject to approval by the plaintiffs.

It’s a design the company says allows for a significant increase in computing power.</p><p>One aspect of Eagle the company isn’t talking about at the moment is quantum volume. Cointed by IBM, it’s a metric that attempts to measure the performance of a quantum computer by taking a holistic view of its different parts. Not only does it take into account qubits, but also the way in which they interact with one another. The higher the quantum volume, the more capable a quantum computer is at tackling difficult problems.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/518f62b0-457e-11ec-833f-60f25d21d5d6" alt="IBM Eagle" data-uuid="0056fd19-e3cc-369d-b225-6be695458c42"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">IBM</div></figure><p>“Our first 127-qubit Eagle processor is available as an exploratory system on the IBM Cloud to select members of the IBM Quantum Network,” Jerry Chow, the director of IBM’s Quantum Hardware System Development unit, told Engadget. “Exploratory systems are early access to our latest technologies and so we do not guarantee uptime or a particular level of repeatable performance, as measured by quantum volume.”</p><p>Without knowing the quantum volume of the Eagle processor, it’s hard to say exactly how it compares to what&#39;s out there already. Last October, Honeywell claimed its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/honeywell-system-model-h1-quantum-computer-128-quantum-volume-141054348.html">System Model H1</a> had a quantum volume of 128 with just 10 connected qubits. For reference, earlier in the year IBM <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2020-08-20-IBM-Delivers-Its-Highest-Quantum-Volume-to-Date-Expanding-the-Computational-Power-of-its-IBM-Cloud-Accessible-Quantum-Computers">announced a 27 qubit system</a> with a then industry-leading quantum volume of 64. Clearly, the company’s new processor is powerful, but qubits don’t tell the whole story here.</p><p>What’s also notable about Eagle is that IBM is not claiming quantum supremacy. According to the company, it’s a step toward that milestone, but the processor is not yet at the point where it can solve problems that classical computers cannot. In 2019, Google sparked controversy when it (briefly) claimed it had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-23-google-quantum-supremacy.html">achieved the feat</a> with its Sycamore system. At the time, IBM called the company’s claims “indefensible” based on the fact Google built the computer to solve one specific equation.</p><p>IBM will make Eagle available to select members of its <a href="https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/ibm-q-network/">Quantum Network</a> starting next month.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ibm-eagle-processor-050133991.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cec5369b-79f5-47e6-af6b-4eef3c7e5daf</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 15 Nov 2021 05:01:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636982415</ingested><modified>2021-11-15T13:20:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3cf83ca0-457e-11ec-a7ff-0e79d67ad107" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3cf83ca0-457e-11ec-a7ff-0e79d67ad107" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[IBM]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[IBM Quantum]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[IBM Quantum]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tesla is deploying Starlink satellite internet dishes at Superchargers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Don&#39;t despair if you want to stream a show at a Tesla Supercharger but aren&#39;t paying for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-24-tesla-premium-connectivity-charges.html">Premium Connectivity</a> — you might have an official alternative. <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/11/14/tesla-starts-deploying-starlink-satellite-internet-systems-supercharger-stations/">According</a> to <em>Electrek</em>, Tesla EV owners have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/qte6h1/starlink_dish_dishy_mcflatface_spotted_at/">spotted</a> Starlink satellite internet dishes at Supercharger stations.

That promises faster load times, a smoother interface, better gaming and headroom for new features like a live picture-in-picture view of your video doorbell. WiFi 6 support also delivers a more reliable connection for your 4K streams if you have a similarly modern router. While those aren&#39;t must-haves, the price gap is small enough ($10 as of this writing) to make them worth the money.</p><p>Fire TV&#39;s usual caveats apply regardless of the model you&#39;re buying.  You&#39;ll have access to a wide range of apps and services, but there&#39;s no doubt Amazon favors its own.

There are some areas where the new arrangement (billed by the UN as the Glasgow Climate Pact) may offer significant progress, but there are also concerns it doesn&#39;t hold countries to stricter standards — including a move away from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-30-clean-coal-myth-trump-carbon-capture-energy-no.html">coal energy</a>.</p><p>In negotiations that extended roughly a day past the original November 12th deadline, representatives from China and India successfully changed language in the COP26 agreement that asked countries to &quot;phase-down&quot; unabated coal use rather than &quot;phase-out.&quot; While COP26 president Alok Sharma and numerous countries&#39; delegates wanted the tougher language, Sharma said it was &quot;vital&quot; to protect the deal. However, there are worries this will give coal-dependent countries like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-26-china-raises-renewable-energy-target-to-reduce-coal.html">China</a> and India an excuse to avoid firmer commitments to emissions reduction.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Previous critics blasted wealthier nations for failing to act on a promise of giving poorer countries $100 billion per year until 2023 to help them deal with climate change. The Glasgow deal only committed to making a new plan in the next three years.</p><p>The final pact does include some notable measures. It asks countries &quot;revisit and strengthen&quot; their climate change plans before the end of 2022, as <em>New Scientist</em><a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2297452-cop26-world-agrees-to-phase-out-fossil-fuel-subsidies-and-reduce-coal/">noted</a>. Similarly, there&#39;s a strategy to address long-running disputes over global carbon credit markets. Numerous countries promised to reduce methane emissions and stop deforestation, and the agreement called for reduced subsidies on fossil fuels. Separately, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-china-climate-change-pledge-cop-26-194435337.html">US and China reached a deal</a> to limit climate change in the 2020s, including a new recognition from China that methane had a significant impact on rising temperatures.</p><p>Nonetheless, there are fears the COP26 arrangement is generally too soft. It doesn&#39;t set many binding targets. The final language only &quot;requests&quot; that countries rethink their plans, for instance. The pact might prompt some countries to step up their environmental initiatives, but others may face relatively few consequences if they fall short.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/cop26-climate-change-glasgow-pact-212507731.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2c9886c6-7440-45ec-80e6-e3572b3d452d</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 13 Nov 2021 21:25:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636982525</ingested><modified>2021-11-15T13:22:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Climate Change]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/2c98d340-44c2-11ec-b9b3-63de6df0f242" width="3162" height="2077" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/2c98d340-44c2-11ec-b9b3-63de6df0f242" width="3162" height="2077" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Yves Herman / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[COP26 President Alok Sharma holds a gavel as he speaks at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland, Britain November 13, 2021.

But one technology Roddenberry called for in the 1960s has yet to make it off the screen: teleportation. It&#39;s not only that &quot;we just don&#39;t have enough power,&quot; as Scotty would say, we also lack the fundamental knowledge base to make it a reality. For now, at least.

Unfortunately, physics has some pretty hard rules about anything happening instantaneously. Anything that happens (an effect) has to have a cause, which in turn requires the transmission of information. Think about it: in order for two things to be causally related to each other (like you disappearing here and you appearing somewhere else), they have to somehow talk to each other. And in this universe, everything, including information, has a speed limit.</p><p>Information has to travel through space just like everything else, and the fastest anything can travel in this universe is the speed of light. Really, the speed of light should have been called the “speed of information” or “the universe’s speed limit.” It’s baked into relativity and the very idea of cause and effect, which are at the heart of physics.</p><p>Even gravity can’t move faster than light. The Earth doesn’t feel gravity from where the Sun is right now; it feels gravity from where the Sun was eight minutes ago. That’s how long it takes information to travel the ninety-three million miles between here and there. If the Sun disappeared (teleporting off for its own vacation), the Earth would continue in its normal orbit for eight minutes before realizing that the Sun was gone.</p><p>So the idea that you can disappear in one place and reappear in another place instantly is pretty much out of the question. Something has to happen in between, and that something can’t move faster than light.</p><p>Fortunately, most of us aren’t such sticklers when it comes to the definition of “teleportation.” Most of us will take “almost instantly” or “in the blink of an eye” or even “as fast as the laws of physics will allow” for our teleportation needs. If that’s the case, then there are two options for making a teleportation machine work:</p><p>1. Your teleportation machine could transmit you to your destination at the speed of light.</p><p>2. Your teleportation machine could somehow shorten the distance between where you are and where you want to go.</p><p>Option #2 is what you might call the “portal” type of teleportation. In movies, it would be the kind of teleportation that opens up a doorway, usually through a wormhole or some kind of extradimensional subspace, that you step through to find yourself somewhere else. Wormholes are theoretical tunnels that connect points in space that are far away, and physicists have definitely proposed the existence of multiple dimensions beyond the three we are familiar with.</p><p>Sadly, both of these concepts are still very much theoretical. We haven’t actually seen a wormhole, nor do we have any idea how to open one or control where it leads. And extra dimensions aren’t really something you can move into. They only represent extra ways in which your particles might be able to wiggle.</p><p>Much more interesting to talk about is Option #1, which, as it turns out, might actually be something we can do in the near future.</p><h2>Getting There at Light Speed</h2><p>If we can’t appear in other places instantly, or take shortcuts through space, can we at least get there as fast as possible? The top speed of the universe, three hundred million meters per second, is plenty fast to cut your commute down to a fraction of a second and make trips to the stars take years instead of decades or millennia. Speed-of-light teleportation would still be awesome.</p><p>To do that, you might imagine a machine that somehow takes your body and then pushes it at the speed of light to your destination. Unfortunately, there’s a big problem with this idea, and it’s that you’re too heavy. The truth is that you’re too massive to ever travel at the speed of light. First, it would take an enormous amount of time and energy just to accelerate all the particles in your body (whether assembled or broken up somehow) to speeds that are close to the speed of light. And second, you would never get to the speed of light. It doesn’t matter how much you’ve been dieting or working on your CrossFit; nothing that has any mass can ever travel at the speed of light.</p><p>Particles like electrons and quarks, the building blocks of your atoms, have mass. That means that it takes energy to get them moving, a lot of energy to get them moving fast, and infinite energy to reach the speed of light. They can travel at very high speeds, but they can never achieve light speed.</p><p>That means that you, and the molecules and particles that make up who you are right now, would never actually be able to teleport. Not instantaneously, and not at the speed of light. Transporting your body somewhere that quickly is never going to happen. It’s just not possible to move all the particles in your body fast enough.</p><p>But does that mean teleportation is impossible? Not quite!</p><p>There is one way it can still happen, and that’s if we relax what “you” means. What if we didn’t transport you, your molecules or your particles? What if we just transmitted the idea of you?</p><h2>You Are Information</h2><p>One possible way to achieve speed-of-light teleportation is to scan you and send you as a beam of photons. Photons don’t have any mass, which means they can go as fast as the universe will allow. In fact, photons can only travel at the speed of light (there’s no such thing as a slow-moving photon).*</p><p>Here’s a basic recipe for speed-of-light teleportation:</p><p>Step #1: Scan your body and record where all your molecules and particles are.</p><p>Step #2: Transmit this information to your destination via a beam of photons.</p><p>Step #3: Receive this information and rebuild your body using new particles.</p><p>Is this possible? Humans have made incredible progress in both scanning and 3D printing technologies. These days, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can scan your body down to a resolution of 0.1 millimeters, which is about the size of a brain cell. And scientists have used 3D printers to print increasingly more complicated clusters of living cells (known as “organoids”) for testing cancer drugs. We’ve even made machines (using scanning tunneling microscopes) that can grab and move individual atoms. So it’s not hard to imagine that one day we might be able to scan and then print whole bodies.</p><p>The real limitation, though, might not be technological but philosophical. After all, if someone made a copy of you, would it actually be you?</p><p>Remember, there’s nothing particularly special about the particles that make up your body right now. All particles of a given type are the same. Every electron is perfectly identical to every other electron, and the same is true for quarks. Particles don’t come out of the universe factory with personalities or any sort of distinguishing features. The only difference between any two electrons or any two quarks is where each of them is and what other particles they’re hanging out with.*</p><p>But how much would a copy of you still be you? Well, it depends on two things. The first is the resolution of the technology that scans and prints you. Can it read and print your cells? Your molecules? Your atoms, or even your individual particles?</p><p>The even bigger question is how much your “you-ness” depends on the tiny details. What level of detail does it take for the copy to still be considered you? It turns out that this is an open question, and the answer might depend on how quantum your sense of self is.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-frequently-asked-questions-about-the-universe-jorge-cham-daniel-whiteson-penguin-163100834.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c4fc3d2f-70c3-4663-9cb1-2192bcab8dbc</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 13 Nov 2021 16:31:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636478955</ingested><modified>2021-11-09T17:29:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Physics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9616eb70-3e6b-11ec-bda9-a7102c9653fb" width="2200" height="1467" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9616eb70-3e6b-11ec-bda9-a7102c9653fb" width="2200" height="1467" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Hitting the Books: Why we can&#39;t &#39;beam ourselves up&#39; Star Trek-style]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
