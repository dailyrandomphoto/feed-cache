And while the software let you download your photos and files, any passwords stored on your keychain were a more complicated matter. That’s about to change for the better.&nbsp;</p><p>With version 12.5 of iCloud for Windows, Apple is adding a password manager to the software. Once you download the update from the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/icloud/9pktq5699m62?activetab=pivot:overviewtab#">Microsoft Store</a>, you can use the tool to add, edit, copy and paste, delete and look up any passwords you have stored in your iCloud keychain. You can also use the app in conjunction with a Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome extension to autofill a password when you’re surfing online.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apple says the app stores all your passwords within an encrypted database on your computer and transfers them to the relevant browser extension over a secure channel. The app will automatically save and sync any website usernames and passwords but won’t do the same for applications and other sensitive personal data like your credit card number.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s all pretty standard functionality apps like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/1-password-8-mac-early-access-120012791.html">1Password</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dashlane-essentials-plan-192046825.html">Dashlane</a> have offered for years, but if you’re an iPhone user who frequently saves their logins to iCloud, you’ll appreciate having easy access to them on your PC.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-icloud-version-12-5-212632356.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3ae26bbf-3730-4131-9220-2db5a2f9b54d</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2021 21:26:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629149196</ingested><modified>2021-08-16T21:26:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/60f4c5d0-fed7-11eb-af9b-17716f3379f8" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/60f4c5d0-fed7-11eb-af9b-17716f3379f8" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Igor Bonifacic / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iCloud Windows]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iCloud Windows]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[T-Mobile confirms unauthorized access to 'some' data]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following reports of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-data-breach-investigation-202913474.html"><ins>data breach over the weekend</ins></a>, T-Mobile has confirmed it’s investigating a cybersecurity incident.

For instance, Carnegie Mellon fitted its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/carnegie-mellon-snake-robot-swims-181159998.html"><ins>famous snakebot with turbines and thrusters</ins></a> earlier this year to give it aquatic capabilities. But few can do so with the grace, speed and effortlessness of a real-life fish. And it’s not that scientists have avoided trying to create a robot that can do just that, but the exact way fish swim faster or slower is something that has proved elusive.</p><p>Marine biologists have known for a while that the secret lies somewhere in the way they can alter the rigidity of their tails. The problem is that it’s difficult to measure that while a fish swims. However, using a combination of fluid dynamics and biomechanics, <a href="https://robotics.sciencemag.org/content/6/57/eabe4088"><ins>researchers from the University of Virginia</ins></a> say they’ve derived a formula that not only provides an answer to that question but also allows a robot with a specially designed tail to be nearly as good as its natural counterpart at speeding up and slowing down in water.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When they applied the formula to a tuna-like robot they built, they found it could swim at a greater variety of speeds using almost half as much energy as one with a fixed-stiffness tail. If you’re a cyclist, you’ll love this analogy. &quot;Having one tail stiffness is like having one gear ratio on a bike,&quot;  Dan Quinn, one of the co-authors of the study, told <a href="https://bigthink.com/technology-innovation/robot-tuna-tail"><em><ins>Big Think</ins></em></a>. &quot;You&#39;d only be efficient at one speed. It would be like biking through San Francisco with a fixed-gear bike; you&#39;d be exhausted after just a few blocks.&quot;</p><p>With a tuna-sized machine under their belt, the University of Virginia team plans to scale their tail technology for use on both bigger and smaller robots. They’re also developing one that undulates like a stingray. Their work could one day lead to a class of drones that can quickly travel to a remote location and then slow down to investigate the area. Like an aquatic snakebot, that&#39;s something the Navy could use to inspect their ships for damage.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tuna-robot-university-of-virginia-200013926.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">833d9418-da31-4e95-83d6-0b7015c4e553</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2021 20:00:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629144019</ingested><modified>2021-08-16T20:00:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/573879e0-feca-11eb-bbff-97fa64093af1" width="1600" height="1001" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/573879e0-feca-11eb-bbff-97fa64093af1" width="1600" height="1001" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[University of Virginia]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tuna robot]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tuna robot]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Wikipedia vandal adds swastikas to 53,000 pages]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/wikipedia"><ins>Wikipedia</ins></a> vandalism is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2006-11-10-bitter-fanboys-shred-nintendos-wikipedia-entry.html"><ins>hardly a new phenomenon</ins></a>, but one user was able to add swastikas to tens of thousands of articles.

However, a new development from MIT could change that. In a joint project with Shanghai Jiao Tong University, the school designed a <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/inflatable-robotic-hand-tactile-0816">neuroprosthetic that costs about $500</a> in components. It&#39;s an inflatable hand made from an elastomer called EcoFlex and looks a bit like Baymax from <em>Big Hero 6</em>.</p><div id="f334044c946f4779887c0820358bf49c"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p1d8i2lwuFw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The device foregoes electric motors in favor of a pneumatic system that inflates and bends its balloon-like digits. The hand can assume various grasps that allow an amputee to subsequently do things like pet a cat, pour a carton of milk or even pick up a cupcake. The device translates how its wearer wants to use it through a software program that &quot;decodes&quot; the EMG signals the brain sends to an injured limb.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The prosthetic weighs about half a pound and can even restore some sense of feeling for its user. It does this with a series of pressure sensors. When the wearer touches or squeezes an object, they send an electric signal to a specific position on their amputated arm. Another advantage of the arm is it doesn&#39;t take long to learn how to use it.  After about 15 minutes, two volunteers found they could write with a pen and stack checkers.</p><p>&quot;This is not a product yet, but the performance is already similar or superior to existing neuroprosthetics, which we&#39;re excited about,&quot; said Professor Xuanhe Zhao, one of the engineers who <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-021-00767-0">worked on the project</a>. &quot;There&#39;s huge potential to make this soft prosthetic very low cost, for low-income families who have suffered from amputation.&quot;</p><p>While we&#39;re a while away from seeing this tech in the real world, the team behind the project is already working on improving the design. They want to make it better at decoding electrical inputs and more customizable when it comes time for mass production.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/mit-neuroprosthetic-inflatable-robotic-hand-181806396.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a64883b9-c4a8-4bf1-bcc7-41a9c95d4012</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2021 18:18:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629137890</ingested><modified>2021-08-16T18:18:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/46918220-febc-11eb-ac7e-5f9b978b9663" width="1600" height="1001" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/46918220-febc-11eb-ac7e-5f9b978b9663" width="1600" height="1001" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[MIT]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[MIT neuroprosthetic balloon hand]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[MIT neuroprosthetic balloon hand]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Blue Origin takes NASA to court over SpaceX lunar lander contract]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jeff-bezos-nasa-open-letter-181522642.html">$2 billion Hail Mary</a>, Jeff Bezos&#39; Blue Origin has filed a complaint with the US Court of Federal Claims over NASA&#39;s handling of the Human Landing System program. The court challenge comes less than a month after the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gao-denies-blue-origin-dynetics-protest-nasa-human-landing-system-181019362.html">dismissed a protest</a> the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-blue-origin-225547469.html">filed in response to NASA&#39;s decision</a> to award a single contract for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-19-nasa-artemis-explainer-apollo-missions.html">Artemis lunar lander</a>. The agency went with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-nasa-artemis-lunar-lander-contract-report-184448656.html">$2.9 billion bid</a> from Elon Musk&#39;s SpaceX, opting not to fund a $5.9 billion proposal from Blue Origin.&nbsp;</p><p>NASA&#39;s original intention was to sign two separate contracts, but limited funding from Congress made that difficult to do so. Blue Origin alleged the decision was &quot;fundamentally unfair&quot; because NASA allowed SpaceX to modify its bid, something the company says it didn&#39;t get the opportunity to do as well. However, the GAO concluded NASA&#39;s &quot;evaluation of all three proposals was reasonable and consistent with applicable procurement law, regulation, and the announcement&#39;s terms.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="883936210821465a8db7fe13018e4855"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The sad thing is that even if Santa Claus suddenly made their hardware real for free, the first thing you’d want to do is cancel it</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1426326891485609985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 13, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>At the time, Blue Origin hinted it would escalate the situation. &quot;We stand firm in our belief that there were fundamental issues with NASA&#39;s decision, but the GAO wasn&#39;t able to address them due to their limited jurisdiction,&quot; the company said following the announcement.</p><p>&quot;Blue Origin filed suit in the US Court of Federal Claims in an attempt to remedy the flaws in the acquisition process found in NASA&#39;s Human Landing System,&quot; a spokesperson for Blue Origin told Engadget. &quot;We firmly believe that the issues identified in this procurement and its outcomes must be addressed to restore fairness, create competition, and ensure a safe return to the Moon for America.&quot;</p><p>What this means for the Human Landing System program and Project Artemis more broadly is likely another delay. Following Blue Origin&#39;s GAO protest, NASA ordered SpaceX to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lunar-lander-gao-223702744.html">stop work on the lunar lander contract</a> while the watchdog investigated the matter. While this latest complaint is sealed, a source told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22623022/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-sue-nasa-lawsuit-hls-lunar-lander"><em>The Verge</em></a> Blue Origin asked a judge to order a temporary pause on SpaceX&#39;s contract while the case is resolved in court. NASA and SpaceX lost about three months waiting for the GAO to investigate Blue Origin&#39;s protest. If a judge approves the company&#39;s request, this latest pause could be even longer. Ultimately, any further delays will make NASA&#39;s goal of returning to the Moon by 2024 difficult.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-federal-claims-court-nasa-challenge-163927526.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fb8f1e57-49ee-4f9f-b72e-449d353fb31f</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2021 16:39:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629131970</ingested><modified>2021-08-16T16:39:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d9074d00-ea36-11eb-bfb7-4e4759e4f1e8" width="5500" height="3515" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d9074d00-ea36-11eb-bfb7-4e4759e4f1e8" width="5500" height="3515" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Joe Skipper / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Billionaire American businessman Jeff Bezos wears goggles owned by Amelia Earhart which he carried into space at a post-launch press conference after he flew on Blue Origin's inaugural flight to the edge of space, in the nearby town of Van Horn, Texas, U.S., July 20, 2021.

Devices like Amazon&#39;s Kindles let you take your whole library with you, so you&#39;re never without options when picking your next read. They also make good student devices if you have a lot of digital textbooks available to you. Those looking to pick up a new e-reader for work or play can get a Kindle for less right now — Amazon just knocked the price of its <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Kindle Paperwhite" href="https://amzn.to/37OoTrW">Kindle Paperwhite</a> down to $80 and its standard <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Kindle" href="https://amzn.to/3m7Gd3x">Kindle</a> down to $65. While not a record low for the Kindle, the $50 discount on the Paperwhite brings it back down to its Prime Day price.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Kindle Paperwhite at Amazon - $80" href="https://amzn.to/37OoTrW">Buy Kindle Paperwhite at Amazon - $80</a><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Kindle at Amazon - $65" href="https://amzn.to/3m7Gd3x">Buy Kindle at Amazon - $65</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-13-kindle-paperwhite-review-2018.html">Paperwhite</a> may be three years old at this point, but it remains one of the best e-readers you can buy. Not only is it compact, but it has a waterproof design that will protect it against accidental splashes. Amazon updated it a few years ago with a higher-contrast display plus Audible support, which means you can listen to audiobooks when you have a pair of Bluetooth headphones connected to the device.</p><p>While we recommend the Paperwhite to those that can afford it, Amazon&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-10-amazon-kindle-review-2019.html">standard Kindle</a> is a much better buy now than it was a couple of years ago. When last updated, the Kindle received a higher-contrast display, a new front light that makes reading in dark places much easier and a smaller, sleeker design. It may not have the bells and whistles that the Paperwhite has, but it does its one and only job of displaying ebooks well.</p><p>That said, if you&#39;re still happy with your old yet trusty e-reader, it&#39;s probably not necessary to upgrade. Kindles have received some convenient new features over the past few years, but none fundamentally change the experience of reading an ebook. But for those that haven&#39;t yet taken the plunge, Amazon&#39;s latest sale is a great one to consider if you want to bring an e-reader into your life. The biggest caveat to keep in mind is that these discounts are on the ad-supported Kindles, so you&#39;ll have to deal with Amazon&#39;s &quot;special offers&quot; and lock screen ads on your e-reader.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-regular-kindle-sale-161429099.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3509439d-3980-465a-9537-5b6683c2b035</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2021 16:14:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629130527</ingested><modified>2021-08-16T16:15:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-07/b1455520-caaf-11ea-b7fd-cd71b511a902" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-07/b1455520-caaf-11ea-b7fd-cd71b511a902" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Kindle Paperwhite]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Kindle Paperwhite]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Intel Arc, the company's first gaming GPUs, will debut in 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/intel">Intel</a> has chosen a name for its high-performance consumer graphics products: Intel Arc.

The investigation will also include examination of the contributing circumstances for the confirmed crashes&quot; mentioned in the document as well as similar crashes, the ODI wrote.</p><p>The NHTSA <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-06-30-tesla-under-investigation-after-first-autopilot-related-death.html">investigated</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-19-investigation-clears-tesla-for-fatal-autopilot-crash.html">cleared</a> Tesla over the first Autopilot-related death in 2016.

But there are still some companies that still need those chipsets — ASUS being a notable example. The Taiwanese electronics giant&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-phone-5-gaming-phone-112327496.html">ROG phones</a> have high-end components aimed at the most demanding users and mobile gamers.</p><p>That&#39;s exactly the audience for the new &quot;Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders,&quot; a phone that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-asus-smartphone-snapdragon-insiders-150023369.html">Qualcomm built with help from ASUS &quot;for its fans&quot;</a>. It boasts features like a 6.8-inch screen with a 144Hz refresh rate, comprehensive 5G support, fast charging and special audio enhancements. Clearly, this $1,499 device is a showcase for Qualcomm’s strengths, and though its name says it’s for Snapdragon Insiders, anyone can buy it. But should you?</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Design</h2><p>That depends on a few things, one of which being your preference on phone sizes. This is a <em>big</em> phone. At 210 grams (or 0.46 pounds), the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders (which I’m going to call SSI from now on) is one of the heavier phones I’ve used recently. Many devices with such large screens tend to weigh about the same — the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-snapdragon-865-plus-5g-s-pen-price-140017843.html">Galaxy Note 20 Ultra</a> is lighter, but the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-12-pro-max-review-cameras-battery-price-233156949.html">iPhone 12 Pro Max</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-specs-price-cameras-snapdragon-888-160013665.html">Galaxy S21 Ultra</a> are actually even heavier.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b896ca10-fc82-11eb-bb79-7b298f7f8851" alt="A man holding the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders. The picture shows the phone in his hands, with its rear facing us." data-uuid="a119c96e-bf89-38db-b1f9-a6d8c18d5b1a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>The SSI also looks notably different from the iPhones and Galaxies which, depending on your taste, could be a good or bad thing. Its rounded rectangle body has a matte blue finish with shiny red accents on the camera bump and volume button. And you know how bezels for selfie cameras went away over the last two years on most flagships? That’s not the case here — there’s still a thin border above the screen where the sensor sits. That, combined with the silhouette and finish, make the SSI look pretty outdated.</p><p>Another polarizing feature on the SSI is an illuminated Qualcomm Snapdragon fireball icon on the rear, below the fingerprint sensor. You can set the light to “breathe” (i.e., glow on and off), turn it off altogether, or have it stay on all day. Even when it’s not lit, though, the logo is pretty obvious. It adds clutter to the phone, and made feeling for the fingerprint scanner confusing whenever I wanted to unlock the device without looking at its back.</p><p>One last note on design: The bump for the SSI’s triple-camera array on the back is a surprisingly compact horizontal row that’s neatly tucked away in the top left. It’s smaller and thinner than those on the Galaxy and iPhones, though it still protrudes enough that the handset doesn’t lie flat when you put it on a table.</p><h2>Display</h2><p>Topping the list of the SSI’s premium specs is its display. The AMOLED panel is from Samsung, and it runs at 2,448 x 1,080. It also refreshes at 144Hz, which is one of the fastest on modern smartphones, beating the Galaxy S21 and Note series, not to mention the iPhone family. To ensure that you’re shooting at your enemies as quickly as you can tap on them, the display also offers a 1ms response time.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f24f6690-fc82-11eb-afc1-7d38c1e1e07c" alt="A man holding the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders with its screen facing out. " data-uuid="0dd3f835-6a28-3397-b2b0-2eed2057bcee"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>I furiously scrolled up and down on the Engadget homepage, as well as my Instagram feed, and the display kept pace with my finger. Shooting at my enemies on <em>League of Legends Wild Rift</em> was similarly responsive, and a first-person shooter like <em>Call Of Duty</em> was also satisfyingly speedy.</p><p>Since it’s an AMOLED panel, it also delivers vibrant colors and deep blacks on videos and photos. Its peak brightness of 1,200 nits also makes for easy viewing under sunlight. It’s worth noting, though, that the 20.4:9 aspect ratio causes some content to be cut off — the ends of long messages in Telegram, for example, disappear into the edges of the screen. Qualcomm doesn’t appear to have optimized its display to accommodate all apps.</p><h2>Audio</h2><p>The Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders is one of the first to feature Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Sound technology, which promises low Bluetooth latency, multiple listening profiles and smart amplifier software. It also has four mics and Qualcomm’s “High Dynamic Range Audio Record,” which the company says is capable of delivering studio-quality recording. The SSI comes with a pair of wireless Master and Dynamic earbuds, too, but most of the audio enhancements will work through the phone’s speakers too.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/77d03060-fc83-11eb-bbf7-62ed326e4467" alt="Side view of the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders laid on a wooden surface, showing its power and volume buttons on the right edge." data-uuid="5c088e75-34f9-3dc3-a642-3e02cde28800"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>The Master &amp; Dynamic headphones were built using Qualcomm’s Bluetooth Audio SoC and will support high-res 24-bit 96kHz audio with active noise cancellation. Qualcomm also said these should stay connected to your phone even if there are lots of other RF devices around, so audio drop-outs should be minimal.</p><p>I haven’t visited many busy places during my testing, so I can’t vouch for how well these headphones stay connected in those situations. Plus, the headphones that Qualcomm sent reviewers were pre-production and do “not reflect commercial-ready Snapdragon sound quality.” The company said that when the devices do ship later this month, they’ll have features like high-res audio and super wide band voice for greater call clarity. For now, though, all I can say is the earbuds perform fine. Songs like “Say So” by Doja Cat and “Next Level” by aespa also sounded richer than on the Pixel Buds 2.</p><p>The SSI itself also delivered loud and clear audio, though I don’t usually expect great quality from phone speakers since I rarely play music through them. Sound effects and background tracks on games and YouTube videos rang out nicely, and that’s pretty much all I need from a phone’s sound system.</p><h2>Cameras</h2><p>Like many modern flagships, the SSI has a trio of cameras on its rear. The 64-megapixel main sensor with f/1.8 aperture is accompanied by a 12-megapixel ultrawide option and an 8-megapixel telephoto. That’s a pretty typical setup, though the main camera here is sharper than those you’ll find on iPhones and Pixels.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/9e3bb300-fc83-11eb-b5bf-0187535f5e80" alt="A close up view of the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders&#39; three rear cameras at an angle. " data-uuid="1a13c29c-e847-3d80-9a1a-9dd7e53ebf0c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Qualcomm said an over-the-air update is coming later this month that will enable, among other things, a full resolution mode for better “snapshot performance.”</p><p>Other enhancements that the update is supposed to bring include “better texture/noise performance,” “improved night shot quality,” “Video Super Resolution,” “upgraded camera tuning” and “best autofocus experience.” The company said it will also “fully optimize” HDR via the ultra-wide and telephoto cameras and multi-frame noise reduction. That’s far too many things coming that could sway how I feel about the camera, and I wish they were available to test before the phone hits shelves later this month. For now, I’m supposed to take Qualcomm’s word for it and that’s not how reviews work.</p><p>Without the updated software, the SSI delivered lackluster photos that paled in comparison to the Note 20 Ultra and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5-review-camera-performance-battery-price-150051832.html">Pixel 5’s</a>. The Qualcomm phone’s images had a blue (sometimes green) cast and weren’t significantly sharper or clearer than the Pixel’s, which costs hundreds less. Google’s portrait mode is also superior, and it never failed to keep the lantern fly I was taking pictures of in focus. Meanwhile, the insect came out blurry in 90 percent of the shots on the SSI.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/01e43df0-fc84-11eb-93ef-dd22b86f24a7" alt="A screenshot of the camera app in the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders, demonstrating an Auto Tracking video recording mode. There is a yellow square surrounding a man and Stop and Pause buttons on the right.. " data-uuid="a2779ca9-2215-343d-85f8-2e8d3a3c58eb"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Screenshot (Cherlynn Low / Engadget)</div></figure><p>One thing I was able to test is a unique Auto Tracking mode. Qualcomm re-architected its AI engine to run machine-learning-based tasks better, and one of these features is an Auto Zoom tool in the camera. When you use the Auto Tracking mode, you can tap on the viewfinder to designate a subject, and the camera will automatically adjust framing to make sure your pet or loved one is always in the scene.</p><p>And by the way, this isn’t an autofocus tool that makes sure your kids or fur babies always look clear. Qualcomm’s method will actually zoom in and out to give your selected subject the spotlight. When this worked, like when I shot a clip of our video producer, Brian Oh’s adorable dog Zen as she ambled around the room, it was lovely. The camera zoomed in till Zen’s face took up half the screen and we were staring into her soulful eyes, and zoomed out when she moved out of frame so we always saw her.</p><p>But in my testing, the system was not always good at identifying people’s faces and separating them from the background. That would be fine if it simply didn’t do anything in those cases, but the resulting footage was nauseatingly jerky and looked like the camera was searching for the subject. This is a nice tool in theory, but even if it worked perfectly I’m not convinced I’d use it much.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c2602bd0-fc83-11eb-95ff-fc3670601a24" alt="The Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders with its rear facing the camera against a yellow background. " data-uuid="788f5ce3-0443-3089-bdc1-13d023c2dc43"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Another thing I’m not sure I like is the 24-megapixel front camera. Sharper sensors are nice in general, but the better clarity here didn’t make a big difference over selfies shot on other phones. Again, I don’t know if the coming OTA update will be effective so I can only evaluate the selfie camera as I’ve experienced it.</p><h2>Performance and battery life</h2><p>With a Snapdragon 888 CPU, 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, the SSI has plenty of muscle and ran smoothly for most of my time with it. I encountered occasional hiccups when shooting portrait mode pictures in rapid succession and when trying to shift focus in auto-tracking mode, but those are pretty specific to the camera. When I played <em>League of Legends Wild Rift</em> with screen recording on, the phone never lagged.</p><p>It’s worth noting that the SSI often ran hot, though. After a couple of minutes of concurrent gaming and screen-recording, or a few attempts at capturing video in auto-tracking mode, or even just a round of <em>Settlers of Catan</em>, the area below the fingerprint sensor got noticeably warm.</p><p>The 4,000mAh battery here typically got me through a day and a half, and sometimes more, which is impressive given its screen size and refresh rate. That’s also in line with most devices in this class, like the Note 20 Ultra and the iPhone 12 Pro Max, and better than the S21 Ultra.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4ab32870-fc84-11eb-8d7c-e4b7ae2b56b3" alt="A man using the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders" data-uuid="d9630184-ef58-370d-b837-70a0b753cfca"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>I didn’t go out a lot so I wasn’t using 5G much — if you’re a heavy data user or you set the logo on the back to stay lit all day, the runtime will likely drop. Speaking of, the SSI supports both mmWave and sub-6 5G, though your experience of the speed improvements this brings will depend largely on your carrier and service area.</p><p>When you do run out of juice, it won’t take too long to get recharged. Qualcomm includes a Quick Charge 5 adaptor in the box that it says will get you up to 70 percent in 30 minutes or a full charge in 52 minutes. I did get the phone fully charged in under an hour, which is impressive given the generous battery size.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>On paper, the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders seems like a spec chaser’s dream. But headline features like Snapdragon Sound aren’t ready yet, 5G performance is reliant on your carrier and coverage, while the camera is still pending a major update that <em>may</em> improve performance. Not only does this phone seem like it’s not ready for review, it also feels far too niche. Even demanding users who might like a smartphone like this will get more out of a Galaxy Ultra or the OnePlus 9 Pro. Unless you’re a rabid Qualcomm fan or need a beefy, long-lasting honker of a phone with a 144Hz screen, few people should get the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-asus-smartphone-for-snapdragon-insiders-review-140014488.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">10c4da51-ff66-4e27-860e-1a540c3a8fb5</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2021 14:00:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629123243</ingested><modified>2021-08-16T14:14:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/fc457b10-fe9b-11eb-946d-38746d613343" width="2000" height="1283" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/fc457b10-fe9b-11eb-946d-38746d613343" width="2000" height="1283" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The ASUS Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders photographed in front of a yellow background.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[ASUS Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon knocks up to 30 percent off Echo devices in its 'off to college' sale]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Regardless of if you&#39;re personally heading back to school in a few weeks, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Amazon&#39;s latest sale" href="https://amzn.to/3xL61EN">Amazon&#39;s latest sale</a> is a good opportunity for anyone to grab a new Echo device.

We included it in our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/school-tech-under-50-140026676.html">back-to-school gift guide</a> because it&#39;s a handy little speaker to have for impromptu dance parties, plus it it takes up very little space on a desk and it&#39;s quite cheap even when not on sale. Alexa can also answer basic questions that could help students in the middle of a study session, although we wouldn&#39;t recommend relying on the personal assistant for homework answers. Overall, we gave the Dot a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-dot-clock-2020-review-143052099.html">score of 88</a> from us for its solid audio quality for the price, tap-to-snooze alarm and attractive orb-like design.</p><p>if you have more space to spare, the Echo is one of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-22-smart-speakers-guide-google-amazon-echo-sonos.html">our favorite smart speakers</a> as of late. It combines a three-inch woofer with two 0.8-inch tweeters to produce louder sound than both Google&#39;s Nest Audio and the HomePod mini. The audio quality is great, and if you have two in your home, you can use them as a stereo pair for an even better experience. We also appreciate that, like the Echo Dot, the standard Echo has a 3.5mm audio jack, letting you connect the speaker to another playback device like a turntable.</p><p>Ultimately, though, an Echo device is best if Alexa is your virtual assistant of choice. Alexa has gotten more useful over the years and there are thousands of Skills that you can install and use to make your experience more personalized.

You should note that barring the Kids tablets (see below) these are all ad-supported versions of the devices and opting-out of lockscreen adverts comes at a cost.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Fire HD 8 at Amazon - $60" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-8-tablet/dp/B07TMJ1R3X?&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=productpost2021-20&amp;linkId=b99673f6ecdbc25e6e9b71ff47cbb173&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Buy Fire HD 8 at Amazon - $60</a><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Fire HD 10 at Amazon - $100" href="https://amzn.to/3iPTWK9">Buy Fire HD 10 at Amazon - $100</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Fire HD 10 Productivity Bundle at Amazon - $170" href="https://amzn.to/3m3UBJR">Buy Fire HD 10 Productivity Bundle at Amazon - $170</a></p><p>If you&#39;re looking for an affordable tablet for work, you should check out Amazon&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:productivity bundle" href="https://amzn.to/3m3UBJR">Productivity Bundle</a>, which is currently discounted by $100. With it, you get the Fire HD 10 along with a Bluetooth keyboard and a 12-month subscription to Microsoft 365 for $170. The latter gives you access to Office apps and 1 terabyte of OneDrive cloud storage for up to five devices.

The beta version of the Android Accessibility Suite — which was part of the fourth Android 12 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-beta-4-platform-stability-google-171004146.html">beta</a> that recently arrived on Pixel handsets — includes a neat new way to control your phone. &quot;Camera Switches&quot; essentially lets you use face gestures to complete a number of actions. For instance, you can set the app to detect when you smile or raise an eyebrow in order to open your notifications panel or quick settings. You can also open your mouth to scroll forward or backward. As spotted by <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-camera-switches-control-phone-with-face/"><em>XDA Developers</em></a><em>, </em>the update lets you map around six face gestures to over a dozen phone controls. These can also be tweaked based on gesture size to prevent the app from constantly initiating actions.</p><p>Camera Switches builds upon the Switch Access feature in Android Accessibility Suite, which lets you interact with your device without using the touchscreen. Depending on the context, this can be done using an external device, such as a keyboard, via a USB or Bluetooth connection, or by pressing the built-in buttons on your phone. In that sense, Camera Switches takes the feature up a notch by introducing gestures to the mix. Seeing as most people are already accustomed to unlocking their phones with their face, the new additions shouldn&#39;t seem completely foreign.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While using Camera Switches, you&#39;ll see a persistent notification icon that indicates your camera is being used. However, as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-beta-hands-on-181528378.html">Android 12</a>&#39;s privacy dashboard already includes a status indicator for both the camera and mic, this feature may be unnecessary. <em>XDA </em>was also able to sideload the app&#39;s APK to get the new feature on Android 11.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/android-camera-switches-control-phone-face-114800871.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6950ce5c-5fa3-4037-b105-757918adb2a4</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2021 11:48:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629114513</ingested><modified>2021-08-16T11:48:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a99d83f0-fe85-11eb-8ffd-2a99d94cc2b3" width="5607" height="3683" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a99d83f0-fe85-11eb-8ffd-2a99d94cc2b3" width="5607" height="3683" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Android logo is seen displayed on a phone screen in this illustration photo taken in Tehatta, West Bengal, India on April 27, 2021.

The Pixel 5a could appear any day now, according to the latest reports from, of all places, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5a-parts-leak-210709004.html">repair shops</a>.

Similarly priced phones may look the same on paper, but the Pixel’s imaging capabilities, which lean hard on AI and software, typically produce great images in most situations. I’m sure the Pixel 5a is likely to continue this winning formula — even if it lacks that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-pixel-6-pro-first-look-tensor-processor-better-cameras-160005582.html">homemade Google chip</a>.</p><p>— Mat Smith</p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-3d-printer-moon-regolith-iss-215332227.html https://www.engadget.com/...">NASA sends a 3D printing system for lunar soil to its space station</a></h2><h3>It could help plan for future Moon and Mars habitats.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-3d-printer-moon-regolith-iss-215332227.html https://www.engadget.com/..."><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b476c1d0-fd43-11eb-b379-6dbf01dfe68a" alt="Render of NASA astronaut holding Moon regolith" data-uuid="6b208123-7aa6-33de-8888-1f736ba5b874"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">NASA</div></figure></a><p>NASA&#39;s latest International Space Station resupply mission included a machine meant to demonstrate 3D printing regolith (loose soil or rock) on the Moon and similar extraterrestrial surfaces.</p><p>The Redwire Regolith Print (RRP) project will work in tandem with an existing printer system (ManD) to try 3D printing simulated regolith.

Of course, none of that matters if you want to upgrade right away. In which case, you can&#39;t go wrong with the current Pros, especially if you&#39;re an iPhone owner. The lower price is the icing on the cake.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apples-air-pods-pro-fall-back-to-180-the-second-lowest-price-weve-seen-085820239.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8df7cacc-e4a8-4c16-997b-4074db09c53d</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2021 08:58:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629115670</ingested><modified>2021-08-16T12:08:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b3703de0-fe6d-11eb-bff8-f9ba0768a75b" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b3703de0-fe6d-11eb-bff8-f9ba0768a75b" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[AirPods Pro                                    ]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[AirPods Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[AirPods Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Switch is the first console to sweep Japan's game sales chart in 33 years]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-07-nintendo-switch-review-two-years.html">Nintendo Switch</a> isn&#39;t struggling to compete against the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-5-review-130048353.html">PlayStation 5</a> on its home turf in Japan... far from it.  <a href="https://twitter.com/GameDataLibrary/status/1426003162889134082">Game Data Library</a>, <a href="https://www.axios.com/nintendo-gaming-charts-195b69e0-4d16-44fa-90cf-c2305dad05de.html"><em>Axios</em></a> and <a href="https://in.ign.com/nintendo-nx-1/164591/news/nintendo-switch-sweeps-japanese-sales-chart-a-feat-that-hasnt-been-accomplished-in-30-years"><em>IGN</em></a> report that every game on <em>Famitsu</em>&#39;s August 8th weekly <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/ranking/game-sales/">Top 30</a> chart was a Switch title, ranging from <em>Super Mario Maker 2</em> in 30th place to <em>Minecraft</em> at the top. It&#39;s reportedly the first time a platform has swept that chart since November 1988, when Nintendo&#39;s own Famicom (the basis for the NES) dominated the list.</p><p>Nintendo has controlled the Japanese games chart with multiple platforms before. In the early 1990s, the Famicom, Super Famicom (aka Super NES) and Game Boy cemented its position. It&#39;s much harder for a single system to rule the rankings, though.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There&#39;s also a sharp contrast with the US. While the Switch has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/npd-video-game-spending-record-march-2021-144536464.html">outsold rival consoles</a> in the country and frequently thrives in game sales (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/zelda-skyward-sword-hd-nintendo-switch-230230304.html"><em>Skyward Sword HD</em></a> was July&#39;s best-selling game), it typically faces stiffer competition from the PlayStation and Xbox ecosystems.</p><p>There wasn&#39;t a direct explanation for the sweep, although the titles reflect both Nintendo&#39;s influence and local tastes. Most of the games are either Nintendo&#39;s (including <em>Skyward Sword</em> and <em>Mario Kart 8</em>) or come from franchises that have long been popular in Japan, such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-monster-hunter-rise-limited-edition-155516717.html"><em>Monster Hunter</em></a>, <em>Taiko no Tatsujin</em> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dragon-quest-12-041721411.html"><em>Dragon Quest</em></a>. It also helps that Japan is in the grips of its largest-ever COVID-19 pandemic wave — people may be buying Switch games to keep them and their kids entertained at home.</p><p>Whatever the reason, the feat suggests why Nintendo isn&#39;t in a rush to upgrade the Switch beyond <a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-nintendo-switch-oled-131324519.html">modest revisions</a>. Its hybrid console is still one of the hottest game systems four years after launch, even in the face of technically superior alternatives.</p><div id="ebb50274fc8b4b0e925f1b775459a4f3"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">All Top 30 best selling retail games in Japan last week were Nintendo Switch titles, first time a Top 30 is from a single console since at least November 1988, when the Top 30 was Famicom only. <a href="https://t.co/NgQx0p1EoO">https://t.co/NgQx0p1EoO</a></p>— Game Data Library (@GameDataLibrary) <a href="https://twitter.com/GameDataLibrary/status/1426003162889134082?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 13, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-sweeps-japan-game-sales-chart-215610557.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">093e1407-696e-4d53-8bf8-ab6ad1ce278a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 15 Aug 2021 21:56:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629064572</ingested><modified>2021-08-15T21:56:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-02/0c650070-451f-11ea-b77b-d179d3c1a076" width="1600" height="871" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-02/0c650070-451f-11ea-b77b-d179d3c1a076" width="1600" height="871" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch playing 'Yoshi's Crafted World']]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch playing 'Yoshi's Crafted World']]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google might unveil the Pixel 5a on August 17th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>More evidence has surfaced that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5a-rumor-specs-release-date-170034517.html">the Google Pixel 5a</a> might be right around the corner. <em>Android Police</em> has <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/08/15/exclusive-photos-of-pixel-5a-5g-components-leak-as-repair-shops-prep-for-launch/">obtained</a> what it says are repair shop photos (pictured below) of Pixel 5a parts that appear to confirm rumors swirling around the budget phone, including its release date.

The system supposedly gave Huawei access to a database that helped it collect sensitive citizen and government data &quot;important to Pakistan&#39;s national security.&quot;</p><p>BES alleges that Huawei insisted on creating a duplicate version of the Lahore network in Suzhou, China, that would provide direct access to the Pakistan data. While BES wanted permission from Pakistani officials before going forward, Huawei reportedly claimed it didn&#39;t need permission and initially threatened to cut off the deal if BES didn&#39;t move forward. The Chinese company later said it obtained permission, but apparently refused to provide evidence of this when asked.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The situation may not be clear-cut. Huawei told the <em>Journal</em> there was &quot;no evidence&quot; it had installed backdoors in any products. In a statement from earlier in the dispute, the company acknowledged the duplicate system in China but maintained that it was strictly a test version &quot;physically isolated&quot; from the real network, making it impossible to extract data. An overseer for the Lahore effort, Muhammad Kamran Khan, said an investigation was underway but that there wasn&#39;t any evidence of data theft &quot;so far.&quot;</p><p>Whoever is telling the truth, the lawsuit highlights the ongoing concerns that Huawei might be aiding China&#39;s surveillance goals. The company has long denied the allegations, and there isn&#39;t yet &quot;smoking gun&quot; evidence that it has used backdoors to snoop on other countries. However, that hasn&#39;t allayed suspicions that have led the US, UK and others to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/huawei-files-us-lawsuit-disputing-fcc-security-threat-designation-172919533.html">blacklist its technology</a>. This case might only exacerbate Huawei&#39;s situation, even if BES&#39; assertions don&#39;t hold up in court.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/huawei-contractor-pakistan-backdoor-194308607.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b3d76098-7882-451e-99e1-37052c42347a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 15 Aug 2021 19:43:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629117854</ingested><modified>2021-08-16T12:44:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/199c07d0-fdeb-11eb-9feb-3d2676895ca0" width="5137" height="3363" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/199c07d0-fdeb-11eb-9feb-3d2676895ca0" width="5137" height="3363" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Wolfgang Rattay / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The logo of the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies is pictured next to a statue on top of a building in Copenhagen, Denmark, June 23, 2021.

Intelligence officer and initiative leader John Cohen told <em>The</em><em>Wall Street Journal</em> in an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/homeland-security-considers-outside-firms-to-analyze-social-media-after-jan-6-failure-11629025200?mod=rss_Technology">interview</a> that Homeland Security is looking at hiring companies to analyze social networks for signs of impending terrorism and other extremist violence. The department had been studying social media before, but the outside partners would help &quot;dramatically&quot; expand these efforts, Cohen said.</p><p>Murmurs of extensive social media scanning first surfaced in May, but there were few details about how it would work. The rumors suggested Homeland Security would focus on alarming trends rather than individual targets, such as brewing extremist movements or threats against specific communities. The aim is to catch the violent rhetoric behind events like the January 6th <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-bans-stop-the-steal-ahead-of-inaguration-214239970.html">Capitol riot</a>, which Homeland Security didn&#39;t anticipate despite mounting social media activity.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>One of the companies involved in discussions is Logically, a firm that uses a mix of AI and human analysis to track online content at a large scale. It was previously involved in a government effort to fight <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-tool-voter-misinformation-report-190524785.html">voting misinformation</a>, but here could use publicly accessible social media to spot trouble.</p><p>Whether or not Homeland Security can address privacy fears is another matter. Cohen said the department wouldn&#39;t use companies to acquire information it was restricted from seeing, and <em>Journal</em> sources said officials were determined to protect civil liberties. Logically chief Lyric Jain said his company couldn&#39;t share personal data for Americans without court orders.</p><p>Even so, there are concerns Homeland Security could abuse this private analysis. It could theoretically hold on to content and use the data to pursue unrelated criminal cases or target peaceful political dissent. That could chill free speech by making people afraid to talk about certain subjects in public channels, even if there are no discussions of violent intentions.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/homeland-security-social-media-search-plans-152947703.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">be4d31e9-501c-44b1-9e0a-db0ae62f35d3</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 15 Aug 2021 15:29:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629120500</ingested><modified>2021-08-16T13:28:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-01/f88fcd10-1a8f-11e9-97ad-3f9c9fb1dc1d" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-01/f88fcd10-1a8f-11e9-97ad-3f9c9fb1dc1d" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, USA - MARCH 7: The Department of Homeland Security logo is seen on a law enforcement vehicle in Washington, United States on March 7, 2017.
