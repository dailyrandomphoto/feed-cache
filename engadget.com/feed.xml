He&#39;s known for developing clever first-person action and puzzle games including <em>Gravity Bone</em>, <em>Thirty Flights of Loving</em> and <em>Quadrilateral Cowboy</em>, and visually, <em>Skin Deep</em> fits perfectly into his repertoire. The only difference is the gun.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;d never done one where you just have a gun and you straight-up shoot people,&quot; Chung said. &quot;I thought, you know what? This is something that I love. This is a game genre that has been so important to me for a long time... This is kind of my attempt at making a bunch of little things that I like in first-person shooter games, and putting them into a game that I think will be funny.&quot;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0cfc9f70-f004-11eb-baeb-878e1cb0b4db" alt="Skin Deep" data-uuid="c3ae6c97-5da6-3774-b375-dc0687e237f2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Annapurna Interactive</div></figure><p>Chung started coding back in elementary school, when he would spend hours between classes customizing levels in FPS classics <em>Doom </em>and <em>Quake</em>, and he continued modding as titles like<em> Half-Life</em>,<em> Quake 2 </em>and <em>Doom 3</em> hit the scene. He got a job at a mainstream studio in Los Angeles, but continued working on his own projects and eventually went fully independent, picking up a handful of accolades in the process.</p><p>Despite a deep personal connection to the FPS genre, Chung hasn&#39;t released a shooter of his own — but that&#39;s going to change <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/301280/Skin_Deep/">when <em>Skin Deep</em> hits Steam</a>. The actual release date is still up in the air, a fact that may be concerning for anyone who remembers waiting for <em>Quadrilateral Cowboy</em>, a game that was &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-04-29-quadrilateral-cowboy.html">six months away</a>&quot; for well over three years. (On the <a href="https://blendogames.com/skindeep/faq.htm"><em>Skin Deep FAQ</em></a> page, one of the Qs reads, &quot;Is <em>Skin Deep</em> going to take 4+ years of development time like your previous game <em>Quadrilateral Cowboy</em>?&quot; and the accompanying answer is, &quot;I hope not.&quot;)</p><p>Regardless of a release date, today publisher Annapurna Interactive showed off a new trailer for <em>Skin Deep</em>. A new, extra-smelly trailer.</p><p><em>Skin Deep</em> is a non-linear espionage shooter set on a spaceship and played from the perspective of an armed, cryogenically frozen insurance agent whose job is to protect the vessel from invading space pirates. The game looks lighthearted yet sophisticated, in classic Blendo fashion; it involves shooting, sneaking and solving puzzles, and all of it is animated in Chung&#39;s signature cubist style. This ties back to FPS history, too —  <a href="https://blendogames.com/skindeep/faq.htm"><em>Skin Deep</em> and most of Blendo Games&#39; titles</a> are built on a modified port of the <em>Doom 3</em> engine, idTech4.</p><section data-eng-breakout="703d85befe0d416d8ef39b45f407f73a" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0cfd89d0-f004-11eb-b6d4-dcb7f8fe25b3" alt="Skin Deep"></section><p>&quot;I&#39;ve played like a bazillion FPS games because I just really enjoy them, but I feel like there&#39;s so much that can be explored and that I wish these games would explore,&quot; Chung said.</p><p>One of the many odd mechanics in <em>Skin Deep</em> is a sneezing function that appears in particularly dusty or peppery environments.</p><p>&quot;If you&#39;re crawling through a dusty vent your little sneezy air level will increase, then you&#39;ll do a big sneeze noise,&quot; Chung said. &quot;And there&#39;s a bag of pepper that we have. If you shoot it, a big cloud of pepper flies out. You can pick up a pepper bag and throw it at someone and they&#39;ll start sneezing.&quot;</p><p>And then there&#39;s the odor system, which leaves literal clouds of stink behind the player, alerting the space pirates and generally causing problems. There&#39;s logic to this system: The player becomes smelly only once they&#39;re expelled from the space ship&#39;s trash chute, fish bones and all, and then they climb back aboard. The smell clouds disappear once the player figures out how to wash up. All of this falls under a mission titled, <em>Protocol 832: Being Smelly And What To Do About It</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0d478b20-f004-11eb-b3cd-83afef1c7053" alt="Skin Deep" data-uuid="26eff69a-fcc3-34eb-a77d-8f0a7d7d8625"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Annapurna Interactive</div></figure><p>&quot;I love it when games just do things that you don&#39;t expect,&quot; Chung said. &quot;Like for me, one of the big games that was important for me back in the day was <em>Far Cry 2</em>, back in 2008. That game did so much cool stuff for the first-person genre that was not technologically advanced, but they just made design choices that were just interesting and funny. Like you had this map that you had to pull out but it didn&#39;t pause, and you had to look at a map while getting shot at with guns. And so I thought, there&#39;s so much space to do stuff like that. Why not make people smelly?&quot;</p><p>All of Chung&#39;s games are part of the same cinematic universe, so to speak, and <em>Skin Deep</em> is closely tied to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/55000/Flotilla/"><em>Flotilla</em></a>, a space-based battleship game he published in 2010.</p><p>&quot;They all kind of talk to each other, they all kind of share characters,&quot; Chung said. &quot;We&#39;re still figuring out details, but right now the character that we&#39;re playing as in this game is the character from a game I made before called <em>Flotilla</em>. It&#39;s fun to make these little connections between the different games and have them all kind of share things between them.&quot;</p><p>There&#39;s no word on which of Chung&#39;s future projects will receive the smell clouds from <em>Skin Deep</em>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/skin-deep-brendon-chung-new-fps-steam-annapurna-192141277.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ce053a3d-b835-4ac4-8594-7af85c9b95dc</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jul 2021 19:21:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627586502</ingested><modified>2021-07-29T19:22:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0cfc9f71-f004-11eb-ac8f-ce31ef27fcfa" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0cfc9f71-f004-11eb-ac8f-ce31ef27fcfa" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Annapurna Interactive]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Skin Deep]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Skin Deep]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Solar Ash' brings surreal 3D platforming to PC, PS4 and PS5 on October 26th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a kid, Alx Preston spent a significant amount of time as a member of the audience, watching his brother sing in choir and opera groups. One night, he found himself sitting in a pew at the heart of a large, elegant church, letting the sounds of yet another performance wash over him. He was tired. He also happened to be playing a lot of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em> at home.</p><p>“I kind of fell into a dream state,” Preston said. “I was playing a lot of <em>Ocarina of Time</em> at the time, and so the vocals of that mixed with this kind of fantastical vision of going through a forest. I think for me that <em>Ocarina of Time</em> was one of those formative games that really allowed me to see what was possible within the medium.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Preston was the creative energy behind <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-03-20-hyper-light-drifters-combat-mode-is-beautifully-punishing.html"><em>Hyper Light Drifter</em></a>, a pixelated 2D title that helped define a generation of neon-coated indie hits in the mid-2010s, and he’s the founder of LA-based studio Heart Machine. He and a growing team of developers have been working on their sophomore release, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/solar-ash-heart-machine-gameplay-trailer-ps5-235831251.html"><em>Solar Ash</em></a>, since late 2016. It’s a third-person, 3D game set in a dreamlike sci-fi space called the Ultravoid.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/66732220-f00b-11eb-adc3-636b0ffae283" alt="Solar Ash" data-uuid="c0d8d151-c804-351b-828d-9e95f5d9bdd3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Annapurna Interactive</div></figure><p>To put it in terms of Zelda titles, <em>Hyper Light Drifter </em>is <em>A Link to the Past</em>, and <em>Solar Ash</em> is <em>Ocarina of Time</em>.</p><p>“[<em>Ocarina of Time</em>] was really the game that felt so much bigger and limitless in its scope and scale and adventures,” Preston said. “It built a believable world that I could live in and it was 3D, and so of course I always had some idea I might jump into 3D.”</p><p>Today, publisher Annapurna Interactive announced <em>Solar Ash</em> will hit PC and PlayStation platforms on October 26th, five years after Heart Machine began working on it.</p><div id="8f044e02a8be4f2dadab32e9e2126420"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/

Can I actually make games?” Preston said. “And so having answered that question, then the natural next step for me was something in 3D. Can I put something out there that really opens up the world and makes you feel like you can truly escape into something, a creation that is otherworldly, that you otherwise wouldn&#39;t have the experience of? A lot of my childhood was spent escaping into those bigger experiences.”</p><p><em>Hyper Light Drifter</em> was a deliciously difficult 2D action RPG, and at first glance, <em>Solar Ash</em> looks like the third-person, 3D interpretation of that same game world. It’s bright and ethereal, with an emphasis on massive enemies and rapid-fire mechanics. The protagonist, Rei, is a slender assassin on a journey to save her home from the Ultravoid, a supermassive black hole hungry for whole planets.</p><p>Even though it’s 3D, <em>Solar Ash</em> looks so similar to <em>Hyper Light Drifter</em> that Preston has had to clarify whether it’s a sequel a few times over. To be clear, it’s not. But to be fair, Preston has personally contributed to the confusion.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/666bcf20-f00b-11eb-bd7f-3d9861bd889d" alt="Solar Ash" data-uuid="7984d4c8-d690-3ddf-b2e6-036f0d4b16f7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Annapurna Interactive</div></figure><p>“I did ambiguously say it&#39;s in the same universe,” Preston said. “Not like Marvel Cinematic Universe, but literally in <em>a universe</em>. So a million galaxies away, technically sure. It&#39;s still in a universe. So it&#39;s kind of a goof way of saying it. I would say that there are connected threads between the games, because I am who I am as a creator, as an artist... but it&#39;s its own game, it&#39;s its own identity in many ways. It&#39;s not trying to say ‘I&#39;m a sequel’ or anything like that to <em>Drifter</em>.”</p><p><em>Solar Ash</em> is an action platformer with Heart Machine’s DNA baked into its code. It doesn’t attempt to do too much, and the team instead has focused on implementing a handful of core mechanics and making them feel as perfect as possible. <em>Solar Ash</em> is filled with radioactive environments and grotesque enemies, and it&#39;s all about fluidity and agility, surfing through the ruins of lost civilizations at the center of a black hole.</p><p>There are <a href="https://heartmachine.com/team">about 25 people</a> on the <em>Solar Ash</em> team, including <em>Hyper Light Drifter</em> and <em>It Follows</em> composer Rich Vreeland, otherwise known as Disasterpeace. That’s a bigger dev team than the original <em>Hyper Light Drifter</em> crew, but then again, <em>Solar Ash</em> is a bigger game.</p><section data-eng-breakout="7c7fbf560f9640ceba435226dc798c16" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/667210b0-f00b-11eb-bfeb-9d25a1ec7b84" alt="Solar Ash"></section><p>“For <em>Drifter </em>and for <em>Solar Ash</em>, there are similar threads of really focusing on the core elements that are impactful and getting as much mileage out of those as we possibly can,” Preston said. “Because we have a small team making a big-ass project, and the team has been excellent in carrying through on everything that we could. Everyone&#39;s done incredible heavy lifting and worn a lot of different hats, as you have to do on this scale of team, for this scale of project.”</p><p>As Heart Machine’s second game, there’s a lot riding on <em>Solar Ash</em>. Preston has established his brand as an innovative, thoughtful developer, and <em>Solar Ash</em> is his chance to defend it — not only in the court of public opinion, but in his own mind.</p><p>“Audience expectation absolutely factors into it, but for me I&#39;m my own worst critic,” Preston said. “Like any artist, like any creative person, you hate your own work until you don&#39;t and then you let it go. I mostly focused on, how do we feel we&#39;re succeeding internally? Rather than, what is the audience going to expect out of that? Or, what kind of score will you get on Metacritic?”</p><p>Of course, if<em> Solar Ash</em> ends up feeling like a trippy sci-fi extrapolation of <em>Ocarina of Time</em>, it should be a success on all fronts.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/solar-ash-release-date-ps4-ps5-epic-games-store-october-191727611.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">45e0351e-f38e-4e6f-9e82-ca0aadd90afa</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jul 2021 19:17:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627586247</ingested><modified>2021-07-29T19:17:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/6670d830-f00b-11eb-a9e7-3571855eb7fc" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/6670d830-f00b-11eb-a9e7-3571855eb7fc" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Annapurna Interactive]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Solar Ash]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Solar Ash]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jason Schwartzman plays a floating brain in musical adventure 'The Artful Escape']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The Artful Escape </em>is an idealized vision of everything the music industry could be, straight out of the brain of Australian rockstar Johnny Galvatron.

However, for the past few years, Galvatron has been a game developer first and foremost. In the 2010s, he used YouTube videos to teach himself how to create a game in Unreal, building off the 3D animation and coding courses he took back in college, right before Warner Music signed him. He then <a href="http://bnd.studio/">founded a studio</a>, rented some office space, secured a deal with Annapurna, and somewhere along the way, he ended up in a recording booth with Jason Schwartzman.</p><p>&quot;We just hung out and spoke about David Bowie and Bob Dylan and video games and stuff,&quot; Galvatron said. &quot;And it was just like, it was a moment for me. He came into the studio and he had like a cape and he had a dressing gown and like an umbrella and a little tiny Korg synth. He brought all these things and he put them all around him and he would like, do the line with the cape and then he would throw the cape around another way, and then he would hold the umbrella and do the line. I was just on my feet the whole time.&quot;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/00c63610-f097-11eb-8ff4-f410850bb6c8" alt="The Artful Escape" data-uuid="1ebefff3-816e-31bd-90c4-9a4d826a5109"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Annapurna Interactive</div></figure><p>In <em>The Artful Escape</em>, the main character, Francis Vendetti, goes on a multidimensional journey to discover his true stage persona — which seems to be a David Bowie-esque shred machine — while at the same time reckoning with the legacy of his late uncle, a Bob Dylan-style folk icon. He travels through strange and trippy worlds, playing music and hunting for his true sound.</p><p>To give a sense of the game&#39;s oddball vibe, Schwartzman plays a giant brain perched atop a pile of discarded fish parts.</p><p>&quot;He’s a really funny comic support character,&quot; Galvatron said. &quot;Like a very lofty British alien, like a brain floating in an aquarium on a flotilla of goldfish fins. It&#39;ll make sense when you see it.&quot;</p><p>For Galvatron,<em> The Artful Escape</em> is exactly that — an escape. His career as a mainstream rockstar was ultimately unfulfilling, filled with red tape, stagnant bureaucracy and awkward interactions. In between shows, he often found himself curled up in the corner of the tour bus, reading <em>Dune </em>or writing his own novel, watching the continent fly by.&nbsp;</p><section data-eng-breakout="6aed31e03167451aa4814b256ef21069" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/00c60f00-f097-11eb-bfff-8f00847b0eb5" alt="The Artful Escape"></section><p>As a game developer, he&#39;s building the industry he actually wanted to be a part of, one line of code at a time.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s kind of what I dreamed the music industry would be, this world of magical doors and these great experiences, instead of like drinking Melbourne Bitter at an RSL in Wollongong, trying not to get beaten up because you look like you&#39;re in Poison,&quot; Galvatron said.

Johansson claims that the move constituted a breach of contract, as <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/scarlett-johansson-sues-disney-over-black-widow-streaming-release-11627579278"><em><ins>The Wall Street Journal</ins></em></a> reports.</p><p>In the suit, Johansson says <em>Black Widow</em> was supposed to be released exclusively in theaters, per her deal with Marvel. As is often the case for movie stars, a large portion of Johansson&#39;s salary was tied to its box office success.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To watch <em>Black Widow </em>on Disney+, viewers need to fork over $30 for a Premier Access pass. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/black-widow-disney-plus-opening-weekend-174633013.html"><ins>Disney initially estimated</ins></a> that the film generated $60 million in revenue on Disney+ from its opening weekend earlier this month, along with $80 million in domestic and $78 million international theatrical revenue.</p><p>The move may have impacted <em>Black Widow</em>&#39;s performance in theaters (though it&#39;s worth bearing in mind that many cinemas around the globe are still closed amid the pandemic). The total worldwide box office tally is currently $319 million. As <a href="https://twitter.com/Variety/status/1420807381529755648"><em><ins>Variety</ins></em></a> points out, that puts it on track to become one of the lowest-grossing Marvel movies to date. Only one of the six other Marvel movies released since early 2018 has made less than $1 billion in theaters.</p><p>Johansson&#39;s representatives tried to re-negotiate her deal after news emerged about the new <em>Black Widow </em>release strategy, the suit says, but Disney and Marvel were allegedly unresponsive. Releasing <em>Black Widow </em>on Disney+ simultaneously could cost Johansson over $50 million, according to a <em>WSJ </em>source.</p><p>In 2019, before COVID-19 changed everything and with Disney+ on the horizon, Johansson and her team contacted Marvel for confirmation that <em>Black Widow</em> would still be a theatrical-only release. According to an email from March 2019 that&#39;s cited in the filing, Marvel&#39;s chief counsel Dave Galluzzi confirmed that. “We understand that should the plan change, we would need to discuss this with you and come to an understanding as the deal is based on a series of (very large) box office bonuses,” the email states.</p><p>Movie theaters around the world were forced to close their doors following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Distributors scrambled to revamp their release strategies. Warner Bros. has adopted a hybrid format this year, with its movies coming to both theaters and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/every-2021-warner-bros-film-will-simulcast-on-hbo-max-and-in-theaters-184336206.html"><ins>HBO Max on the same day</ins></a> (aka day-and-date releases). It will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/warner-bros-hbo-max-streaming-2022-161147104.html"><ins>return to theater-first releases</ins></a> next year.</p><p>However, that approach was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dune-director-denis-villeneuve-slam-att-warner-hbo-max-162021581.html">criticized by prominent directors</a>, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbo-max-vs-christopher-nolan-and-legendary-052202138.html">Christopher Nolan</a>. Warner Bros. owner WarnerMedia reworked some deals and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-hbo-max-bosss-script-for-a-new-hollywood-11621008116"><ins>reportedly</ins></a> paid creative talent who were due a cut of box office revenue north of $200 million.

In <a href="https://apnews.com/article/robinhood-ceo-vlad-tenev-interview-6d6104eaaa8e6e53e99e1cbe55cca480">an interview</a> with the <em>AP</em>, CEO Vlad Tenev said that, eventually, he wants to turn Robinhood into “the single money app” his users need.</p><p>Though Tenev didn’t use the word “bank,” his description certainly sounds more like a bank than the current iteration of Robinhood.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>Over time, we want to be the single money app, the most trusted and most culturally relevant money app worldwide. So, everything that you use your money for, you should be able to do through Robinhood.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Anytime you receive a paycheck direct deposit, we’d like you to do that through Robinhood. Your emergency fund, your bill pay, your day-to-day spending, we’d like for customers to use us for that. And of course, all types of investing ranging from more discretionary investing to long-term retirement savings as well.</p></blockquote><p>Tenev didn’t elaborate on exactly how these plans could take shape. And though it’s not necessarily surprising the company would want to expand the types of services it offers, the CEO’s comments will likely raise more than a few eyebrows.</p><p>The app, which became popular for its simple interface and commission-free trading, has also drawn criticism for many of its practices.

They&#39;ll even get material tailored to common ridesharing scenarios.</p><p>Drivers will need to have reached Gold, Platinum or Diamond status through the Uber Pro program in a qualifying country (including large parts of the Americas, the UK, India and Spain).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The courses arrive alongside another career initiative.

Many of its drivers are either immigrants (and less likely to be familiar with local languages) or see languages and rideshare work as key to expanding their opportunities. Uber is aware that driving for the company might just be a &quot;temporary stop&quot; on a career path — this gives workers a better chance to move upward.</p><p>There are practical incentives for Uber. The more languages its drivers speak, the more likely those drivers are to get favorable ratings and encourage repeat business. The career incentives could also encourage more drivers to sign up for Uber in the first place, even if they ultimately spend less time in the role.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/uber-rosetta-stone-driver-language-lessons-150311671.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2cbc5ceb-cab6-4bfe-a02e-e5e4b415f47a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jul 2021 15:03:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627572113</ingested><modified>2021-07-29T15:22:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/a75653d0-f073-11eb-bef7-e2da0b006aff" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/a75653d0-f073-11eb-bef7-e2da0b006aff" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LPETTET via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A group of young people using a ride sharing service.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Ride Sharing]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Huawei’s P50 lineup is powered by HarmonyOS 2 but lacks 5G]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/huawei"><ins>Huawei</ins></a> has <a href="https://consumer.huawei.com/en/press/news/2021/huawei-announces-new-huawei-p50-series/"><ins>revealed</ins></a> the P50 and P50 Pro, its first flagship phones that use HarmonyOS 2 from the outset.

Thanks to Apple&#39;s new processor, it&#39;s powerful enough to serve most people well and its new fanless design is a big improvement. The laptop normally starts at $1,000, but now you can get it for $850 on Amazon. That&#39;s a new all-time low and it&#39;s $50 cheaper than the price the laptop has been hovering at for the past few weeks.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy MacBook Air M1 (256GB) at Amazon - $850" href="https://amzn.to/3rGHj6O">Buy MacBook Air M1 (256GB) at Amazon - $850</a><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy MacBook Air M1 (512GB) at Amazon - $1,099" href="https://amzn.to/3l4aGPo">Buy MacBook Air M1 (512GB) at Amazon - $1,099</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The base model comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, but you can also grab the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:512GB model" href="https://amzn.to/3l4aGPo">512GB model</a> for less now, too — $1,099 to be exact, or $150 off its normal price. The extra-storage models ship relatively quickly, but you&#39;ll have to wait until the end of August to get the base laptop in your hands. If you&#39;re willing to wait, this is the best sale we&#39;ve seen on the MacBook Air M1 in months.</p><p>We consider the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-140031323.html">MacBook Air M1</a> to be the best Apple laptop for most people right now. The performance boost that the M1 chipset provides is impressive — sites load almost instantly, scrolling feels effortless and native apps run like clockwork. There&#39;s no fan inside the Air M1, so you&#39;ll get a quieter experience overall — no annoying whirring when you&#39;re pushing the machine to its limits. And the Air M1 should last all day (about 16.5-hours in our testing) so you can use it for work and play.</p><p>The Air M1&#39;s design is quite familiar, but that&#39;s not a bad thing. It&#39;s that familiar thin-and-light clamshell with a lovely 13.3-inch Retina display, a big and accurate trackpad and a comfortable keyboard. Yes, you&#39;ll have to deal with a 720p webcam and just two USB-C ports, but those are small prices to pay for an otherwise stellar machine.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-256gb-sale-850-amazon-135649645.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e4c1a714-5a2f-491d-961f-552f79386844</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jul 2021 13:56:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627567012</ingested><modified>2021-07-29T13:57:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/c8aea820-28a0-11eb-9f89-5ddd62987703" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/c8aea820-28a0-11eb-9f89-5ddd62987703" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple MacBook Air M1]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple MacBook Air M1]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[YouTubers have been rickrolled over a billion times]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the internet&#39;s best-known videos just marked an important (and arguably overdue) historic moment. <em>KIRO7</em><a href="https://www.kiro7.com/news/trending/billion-rick-rolls-rick-astley-video-tops-1-billion-youtube-views/O6PREEJA55HNVGV225LYPSCACI/">notes</a> that Rick Astley&#39;s video for &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot; <a href="https://twitter.com/rickastley/status/1420479592486346757">crossed</a> 1 billion YouTube views on July 28th, putting the original <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-15-fortnite-rickroll-emote.html">Rickroll</a> in the same rare company as clips from the latest pop stars.</p><p>Not surprisingly, Astley approves.

Starting today, a new system software update gives beta users in the US, Canada and parts of Europe the ability to boost local storage with select SSD drives. But, the process isn&#39;t as straightforward as previous reports suggested.&nbsp;</p><p>We already knew the required read speeds would be 5,500MB/s or higher, which limits you to PCIe Gen4 SSDs. Of course, there are plenty of drives that can manage that: The Samsung 980 Pro, Western Digital SN850, Corsair Force MP600, Seagate Firecuda 530, Sabrent Rocket 4 Plus, to name a few.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To make things more complicated, Sony <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5-install-m2-ssd/#min">says</a> that you&#39;ll also need to take into account the PS5&#39;s cooling mechanism. That means you can either attach a heatsink to your SSD, either in a single- or double-sided format, or purchase a compatible SSD with the cooling structure built-in. But, even then, it needs to be the right-sized heatsink that matches the required dimensions. The total size including the cooling structure needs to be smaller than 110mm (L) x 25mm (W) x 11.25mm (H) or, in inches, smaller than 4.33in (L) x 0.984 in (W) x 0.442in (H).</p><p>Basically, you can forget just popping the cover and slotting in just any Gen 4 SSD. For instance, the Corsair Force MP600 has a heatsink which is too high to fit (though you can purchase it without one and use your own thermal solution). Whereas the WD Black SN850 heatsink should be fine.</p><p>Beyond the M.2 SSD support, the PS5 beta software also includes additional software and improvements. Among them is 3D audio support for built-in TV speakers that can boost sound by measuring the acoustics of a room using the DualSense controller. You can switch it on or off from the sound menu in the console&#39;s system settings. What&#39;s more there are a bunch of control customization options in the Control Centre. Here, the Game Base will also let you message friends and parties and see how many friends are online.&nbsp;</p><p>While PS4 and PS5 games will also be labeled accordingly and appear separately in the home screen and game library. The update also packs a trophy tracker for quick access to up to five trophies per game via the Control Center, the option to pick between 720p and 1080p on PlayStation Now and the ability to enable automatic video clips in challenges for high scores. The software update is also rolling out in Japan, UK, Germany, and France.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ps5-ssd-upgrade-beta-software-130741800.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">37fa49b7-ff5e-4c47-9b2a-dc7bd49f6dca</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jul 2021 13:07:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627564065</ingested><modified>2021-07-29T13:08:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/734f82d0-2401-11eb-9fbc-c277751d9846" width="7363" height="4141" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/734f82d0-2401-11eb-9fbc-c277751d9846" width="7363" height="4141" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Future Publishing via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Living room with a Sony PlayStation 5 home video game console and DualSense controller alongside a television, taken on Novemebr 3, 2020.

That was the question running through my mind when <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-nuc-9-extreme-review-tiny-desktop-120034927.html">I reviewed Intel&#39;s NUC 9 Extreme</a> last year. It was the company&#39;s most powerful compact PC kit (NUC stands for &quot;next unit of computing&quot;) at the time. But it was so wildly expensive — especially since you need to add your own RAM, storage, GPU and OS — it didn&#39;t make sense for anyone but mini-PC obsessives. The new NUC 11 Extreme, AKA &quot;Beast Canyon,&quot; is pretty much the same story. But it&#39;s at least a bit cheaper and more flexible, thanks to its faster 11th-gen Intel CPU and support for full-sized GPUs.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="5ae41a77-6821-4a5e-94c6-d221342609ef"/><p>I&#39;ll get this out of the way up front: Yes, this NUC is dramatically larger than any previous units we&#39;ve seen. The 5-liter NUC 9 Extreme already seemed to be pushing the limits of a compact PC, but at 8 liters, the NUC 11 Extreme is what you&#39;d call a Big Boy. Sure, it beats making space for a mid-tower PC on your desk, but it&#39;s still pretty substantial. You can&#39;t blame Intel too much: Gamers wanted full-sized GPUs in a NUC, this is just the most efficient way to make that happen. The big issue now is that Intel is directly competing with increasingly popular Mini-ITX PC cases, which are cheaper but typically more complex builds.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The NUC 11 Extreme screams &quot;gamer&quot; before you even turn it on. Its black metal case sports mesh air vents along the sides, giving you a peek at the GPU within and three large case fans up top. For a small box, it&#39;s clearly meant to push a lot of air. Hit the power button and it springs to life with an LED skull along the front panel, as well as underside LED lighting. I&#39;m not one for too much gamer bling, but Intel&#39;s lighting comes is relatively subtle compared to many other PC makers.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/023afa31-f033-11eb-b9ef-120a9e1ede13" alt="Intel NUC 11 Extreme mini gaming desktop" data-uuid="5a5d33ab-d721-3c8b-b086-6742ed5dd1cd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Our review unit featured Intel&#39;s 11th-gen i9 Compute Element, a modular card with an eight-core 11900KB CPU. It can also be purchased separately as an upgrade for NUC 9 Extreme customers. That was always the dream for Intel&#39;s NUC Extreme platform, which also includes Razer&#39;s Tomahawk mini-PC. Wouldn&#39;t it be nice if you could just yank a card out in a few years to get a new CPU? There are some compromises, though. According to Intel, there&#39;s no front panel audio support when using the new Compute Card on the NUC 9 Extreme, and there&#39;s no guaranteed PCIe 4.0 either. The company also says compatibility with other boxes depends on how the their NUC base board was designed. (We&#39;ve reached out to Razer to see if the Tomahawk can be upgraded.)</p><p>To help speed up our review process, Intel sent along a unit pre-configured with Windows 10 Pro, 16GB of RAM, a speedy 512GB NVMe SSD, and an ASUS RTX 3060 GPU. Remember, you&#39;ll need to gather all of that gear too if you you a NUC kit for yourself (or just buy one pre-built from <a href="https://simplynuc.com/beast-canyon/">resellers like SimplyNUC</a>).</p><p>While I&#39;ve appreciated all of Intel&#39;s previous performance-oriented NUCs, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-10-intel-hades-canyon-nuc-review.html">2018&#39;s &quot;Hades Canyon&quot;</a> model and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-08-09-intel-skull-canyon-nuc-review.html">2016&#39;s &quot;Skull Canyon,&quot;</a> they&#39;ve always been held back by their notebook processors. The NUC 11 Extreme, though, runs more powerful CPUs with a 65-watt TDP. That means it can tap into more power like a traditional desktop gaming chip. And based on our benchmarks, you can definitely see the benefits of that boost.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>None</p></td><td><p>PCMark 10</p></td><td><p>3DMark (TimeSpy Extreme)</p></td><td><p>Geekbench 5</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Intel NUC 11 Extreme (Intel Core i9-11900KB, NVIDIA RTX 3060)</p></td><td><p>7,167</p></td><td><p>4,143</p></td><td><p>1,684/9,345</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Intel NUC 9 Extreme (Core i9-9980HK.

It was slightly faster than ASUS&#39;s ROG Strix G15, which was running AMD&#39;s powerful Ryzen 9 5900HX. Admittedly, we haven&#39;t looked at any gaming notebooks with 11th-gen Intel chips, but based on that AMD comparison I&#39;d still expect the NUC 11 to come out ahead of those. We also haven&#39;t tested comparable 11th-gen desktop CPUs yet, but I&#39;d wager they&#39;ll perform better since they can draw more power.</p><p>Apple&#39;s M1 iMac was the only computer we&#39;ve reviewed that beat the NUC when it came to single-core performance in Geekbench 5, but Intel&#39;s machine still came out ahead in multithreading. The NUC 11 Extreme also impressed me when it came to transcoding a 4K video clip into 1080p. It managed to do that in 41 seconds, beating the speedy ROG Strix G15 by 6 seconds.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/023afa32-f033-11eb-9ff3-45f5d790980c" alt="Intel NUC 11 Extreme mini gaming desktop" data-uuid="f3fa6bdc-82dd-34ea-955f-ca46c669b834"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>I&#39;m mainly focusing on CPU-bound benchmarks, because the NUC 11&#39;s graphics scores will ultimately depend on the GPU you plug into it. But I couldn&#39;t review a gaming PC without actually playing some games, could I? I&#39;m happy to report that it reached 150 fps to 160 fps in <em>Overwatch </em>with epic graphics settings at my ultrawide monitor&#39;s native resolution (3,440 by 1,440 pixels). I was even able to get <em>Control </em>running in 1440p between 60 and 70 fps with medium ray tracing settings and graphics set to high. (Thanks to a healthy DLSS assist, of course.)</p><p>Basically, the NUC 11 Extreme does everything I expect it an RTX 3060-equipped gaming desktop to do. And despite the tight quarters, temperatures didn&#39;t suffer much either. The GPU never went above 75 celsius while gaming, and the CPU stayed under 80 celsius as well. The fans were noticeable under load, but they were never as whiny as the ones you&#39;d find on some gaming laptops. (Larger fans can push more air without making as much noise, naturally.)</p><section data-eng-breakout="4fe6ace429d84cda8957809d40c49bb2" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/021c0081-f033-11eb-bbe6-65dbe1526d38" alt="Intel NUC 11 Extreme mini gaming desktop"></section><p>This being the ultimate DIY PC kit, I also had to tear it open to see just how modular it actually was. The side panels came off easily enough, but I had to spend a few minutes prodding the NUC to make its top panel flip over. That revealed its innards, but I still had to lift up the rear panel to remove the screws securing the Compute Element, its plastic blower, and the GPU. It took around 10 more minutes to fully disassemble the system.</p><p>The entire process felt easier than on the NUC 9 Extreme, simply because there was more room to work with. But it&#39;s still not completely intuitive. I also accidentally tore apart the fan temperature sensors attached to the Compute Element, because a mere tug split them in half. If you&#39;ve built PCs before, you should be able to intuit all of the cables and PCIe release levers you need to find. But I&#39;d recommend taking some photos of all of the tiny wires connected to the Compute Element, because it&#39;s easy to mistake where they go and genuinely tough to plug them back in.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/02368d60-f033-11eb-9bdf-a63c0dee821d" alt="Intel NUC 11 Extreme mini gaming desktop" data-uuid="2dfb9400-f09a-3d2e-90ff-71879062fbb2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>The Compute Element card was similar to the one I held last year, except now there&#39;s a bigger fan and a beefier heatsink. Given the small workable space, I was also interested in seeing how more powerful GPUs would fit into the NUC 11. NVIDIA&#39;s massive RTX 3070 Ti and 3080 had no trouble fitting, and the Radeon RX 6800 dropped in just fine too. The bulkier RX 6800 XT was a no-go, unfortunately. Its heat sink was just a bit too large to fit in properly. Intel says the NUC 11 Extreme should fit GPUs up to 12 inches long, but be wary if you&#39;re planning to use anything with a bulky heatsink.</p><p>I&#39;ll admit, I was surprised that this NUC could actually fit some of the fastest graphics cards on the market. That makes it far more useful than the last model, which was limited to shorter 8-inch long GPUs. Now, you can have a NUC that could genuinely offer most of the speed you&#39;d get with a full-sized desktop. Or maybe you just want a secondary computer to power your game streaming. Based on what I&#39;ve seen, the NUC 11 Extreme can handle most anything.</p><p><em>But</em>, it&#39;s still very expensive. Intel expects the Core i7 and i9 models to be priced between $1,150 and $1,350. (It&#39;s nixed plans for an i5 model.) You can also get the Compute Elements separately between $780 and $980 — a lot to pay for a card that&#39;s essential a cradle for CPUs that cost half the price. And, once again, you&#39;ll also have to shell out for all of the additional hardware and software you need for a Windows PC. All told, you can expect to pay at least another $1,000 if you want 16GB of RAM, 1TB of NVMe SSD storage and a decent GPU.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/023afa30-f033-11eb-b767-45e7a2548a6b" alt="Intel NUC 11 Extreme mini gaming desktop" data-uuid="be2db2ef-2d91-3626-b1ba-6b23d046eb8d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>That may sound ridiculous, but keep in mind the Core i9 NUC 9 Extreme kit started at $1,639 last year. I couldn&#39;t fathom why anyone would pay out the nose for a compromised desktop that couldn&#39;t fit a full-sized GPU. But the NUC 11 Extreme fixes those issues, and it includes a far faster CPU. If all of this sounds too extreme, you can always consider Mini-ITX case builds, but once again be prepared for pricey hardware and even tighter working quarters.&nbsp;</p><p>Intel&#39;s vision for a world where desktop computers can be both powerful <em>and </em>tiny is slowly coming into focus. Now, with the NUC 11 Extreme, Intel finally has a beefy miniature PC that I could actually recommend (assuming you&#39;ve got deep pockets).&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/intel-nuc-11-extreme-review-practical-tiny-gaming-desktop-pc-130041721.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d318bcf9-fe22-41ef-8157-50e54abc3158</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jul 2021 13:00:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627566280</ingested><modified>2021-07-29T13:44:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/02366650-f033-11eb-9dbf-a36902acb4c4" width="2000" height="1233" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/02366650-f033-11eb-9dbf-a36902acb4c4" width="2000" height="1233" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Intel NUC 11 Extreme mini gaming desktop]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Intel NUC 11 Extreme]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nothing’s Ear 1 wireless earbuds are an ambitious start]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>How do you stand out as a new tech company when the dominant players have huge budgets, thousands of employees and decades of product R&amp;D? That is Nothing’s challenge, and its first product, a pair of true wireless earbuds, makes a pitch for a simplified kind of tech, designed to stand out from the likes of Apple AirPods, Samsung Galaxy Buds and their myriad clones.</p><p>Design appears to be very important to Nothing, which has already published several blog posts dedicated to its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nothing-see-through-wireless-earbuds-inspired-by-a-smoking-pipe-110048181.html">philosophy and direction</a> — and that’s before the company even launched anything. This is the result. The $100 Ear 1 buds feature active noise cancellation, touch controls, a wireless charging case and a particularly eye-catching see-through design,<a href="https://www.engadget.com/nothing-ear-1-wireless-earbuds-release-date-133011498.html"> coming to the US mid-August</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This transparency — a design choice that I love — seemingly resonates with Nothing’s mission to make technology less obvious and more seamless. It makes a statement.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/cee23e00-efd8-11eb-bff9-968bbda22a67" alt="Nothing Ear 1 wireless ear buds." data-uuid="ec946850-6529-38a6-8f72-4f6788471d47"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget, Mat Smith</div></figure><p>This styling extends to the charging case, which reminds me a lot of Apple’s old wired headphones that used to come packaged with iPhones. They also came in a half-transparent case. Nothing’s Ear 1 case is predictably more complex. The see-through shell has three indented bubbles that keep the buds in place. There’s a red dot both on the right headphone and its socket inside the charger.</p><p>Like most wireless earbuds, tiny magnets pull the buds into place, but this time they’re visible. Nothing apparently had to find suppliers to make sure its transparent design would work. The company needed glue that was either invisible or at least more aesthetically pleasing, and according to a spokesperson, these tiny, polished magnets were apparently hard to come by.</p><p>So yes, the Ear 1 is all about attention to detail. The case shuts with a satisfying thud, and the snippets of text across the hardware and even the companion app pay homage to retro technology — or perhaps computer interfaces on <em>Alien</em>. These feel like a tribute to see-through tech we’ve seen in the decades past. You might immediately think of those see-through Game Boys from the early ‘90s, but also Apple’s early 2000s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/products/apple/emac/">eMac all-in-one PC</a>, with transparent casing laid onto white and metal.</p><p>Surprisingly, the price is reasonable. These are sub-$100 earbuds, which would put them up against Beats’ latest truly wireless buds and make them cheaper than Apple’s entry-level AirPods. What do you get at this price, though?</p><p>While I haven’t had enough time to fully scrutinize sound quality, the Ear 1s sound decent, although there’s no spatial audio functionality which isn’t great for new headphones in 2021. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/teenage-engineering-ob-4-review-150009876.html">Teenage Engineering</a>, which worked with Nothing on these buds, was responsible for tuning the headphones. The sound is <em>generally</em> clear, but seems to lean toward the mid-range frequencies rather than treble and bass, though you can adjust the equalizer to ramp up either of those levels.</p><section data-eng-breakout="af69266eef2942cab7df17a51cf335af" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/cee23e00-efd8-11eb-bf7c-d0c5f07439a5" alt="Nothing Ear 1 wireless ear buds."></section><p>At this price, they predictably don’t stack up against more expensive earbuds like Sony’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-1000xm4-review-160006474.html">WF-1000XM4 ANC buds</a> or Apple&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-06-apple-airpods-pro-review.html">AirPods Pro</a>. But, perhaps thanks to the silicone tips, they definitely sound better than the original AirPods. The Ear 1s are plenty loud, too.</p><p>Each bud weighs under five grams, making them lighter than those more expensive options, while still packing active noise cancellation — something Google’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-buds-a-series-review-160054961.html#:~:text=After%20months%20of%20rumors%20and,A%2DSeries%20is%20only%20%2499.">similarly priced Pixel Buds A</a> lack. After several months using the AirPods Pro, Nothing’s debut earbuds definitely feel more comfortable to me.</p><p>Despite the lightness, Nothing claims you should get four hours of listening with ANC on, and up to 5.7 hours (340 minutes) with ANC off. The case — which is wider but slimmer than most charging cases — can add up to a total of  34 hours of listening. There’s some fast-charge tech, too: After 10 minutes in the case you can get about another hour of listening time.</p><p>The case can be charged through USB-C or Qi wireless charging — another notable addition at this price. The earbuds are also rated IPX4 for sweat and dust resistance, so they can handle workouts that don’t involve too much rain or perspiration. There are touch controls on both buds, and you can slide your finger up and down the stem for volume control, while a single tap will play/pause and a triple tap will skip a track.</p><p>Nothing’s buds are compatible with both Android and iOS devices, and you don’t gain or lose anything depending on which mobile OS you prefer. That is, apart from fast pairing, which is coming to Android devices but isn’t yet enabled at the time of writing.</p><p>As much as I love the aesthetics of the Ear 1, my first impressions of these earbuds weren’t great. When trying to connect to my iPhone, pairing was a struggle. Once the buds were eventually connected to my phone, Nothing’s headphone app said that the fully charged case was empty — or not even detect it at all. Similar chaos ensued when I tried to shift pairing to my PC and Android phone. Bluetooth connections can be messy — this just seemed like a messier than it should be. The case itself seems to have its own Bluetooth profile, separate from the buds. That might be what makes pairing the headphones so frustrating.</p><p>Nothing’s companion app not only offers a different way to switch between noise cancellation modes, but also a way to reassign touch controls on the Ear 1. It’s a refreshing, uncomplicated app. Having wrestled with other headphone apps from Sony and the rest, though some audiophiles might find it a little restrictive.</p><p>There are four equalizer presets: balanced, more treble, more bass and voice. However, you can’t adjust the equalizer manually. The Ear 1 does offer a little more flexibility with noise cancellation with light and maximum settings you don’t often see on earbuds.</p><p>The Ear 1 has three high-definition mics for voice calls, with Nothing’s own “clear voice technology,” which utilizes algorithms that apparently help isolate and amplify your voice on calls. It should also help cut out wind noise.</p><p>I had a mixed experience with the Ear 1 for phone and video calls. With my handset, the three built-in mics coped with the noise of coffee shops and busy streets fine — in fact the people I talked to said my voice sounded particularly clear. When pairing with my Mac, however, audio quality seemed notably worse than other wireless buds and even the MacBook’s built-in mic.</p><p>The Ear 1 buds are an impressive debut device. Nothing’s first product launch is all about selling you on its cool — the company offered a limited run of hardware on StockX that seemed plainly targeted at Hypebeasts and early adopters. The design is compelling, and even the specifications are impressive at this price point. Nothing needs to improve on connectivity hiccups and sound quality if it wants to be mentioned in the same tier as Apple, Samsung and Sony, but it’s a bold start.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nothing-ear-1-impressions-release-date-price-130026767.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b49320db-b7bf-48e9-a5c2-6733657402cf</guid><dc:creator>Mat Smith</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jul 2021 13:00:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627577022</ingested><modified>2021-07-29T16:43:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mat Smith]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/cee23e00-efd8-11eb-bf7c-d0c5f07439a5" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/cee80a60-efd8-11eb-97d3-2815a9a202f7" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget, Mat Smith]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nothing Ear 1 wireless ear buds.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nothing Ear 1 wireless ear buds]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tesla update adds Disney+ streaming and a Car Wash mode]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tesla is adding another popular streaming service to its in-car infotainment system. As part of its latest software update, you can now watch Disney+ when you have some downtime during charging. Tesla&#39;s Theater Mode already offers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-26-tesla-spotify-netflix-youtube-hulu-cuphead-smart-summon-software-update.html">Netflix</a>, Disney-owned Hulu, YouTube and Twitch. All it&#39;s missing is HBO Max, Peacock and Paramount+ before it can call itself a true video hub. A Tesla owner shared screenshots of the &quot;2021.24&quot; update, which includes several additional features, in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/otqggp/tesla_202124_software_update_release_notes/">Reddit post</a>.</p><p>Another highlight is the new &quot;Car Wash Mode&quot; that secures the vehicle for a scrub down. Once activated, it can close or disable everything from the windows to wipers to sentry mode and the parking sensor chimes. For car washes with conveyor belts, the mode can switch the free roll option to neutral to prevent the car from auto-braking if you leave.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There&#39;s also a new dashcam auto-save that automatically stores clips whenever the vehicle detects a safety event (like a collision or airbag deployment). To stave off any more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-china-local-data-center-182330571.html">damaging</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-chinese-social-media-spying-fears-131002911.html">privacy</a> concerns, Tesla has chosen to make the feature opt-in. Clips will also be stored locally and never shared with the automaker.</p><p>Rounding out the new additions are auto-dimming for mirrors, more battery info, remain connected to WiFi in drive, along with language support for Russian, Romanian and Hungarian. As usual, the quality of life improvements are designed to keep Tesla owners satisfied long after they&#39;ve shelled out thousands on an EV.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-software-update-disney-plus-114824220.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a7c96a52-848d-4328-845d-488f471993c6</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jul 2021 11:48:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627568550</ingested><modified>2021-07-29T14:22:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/13b7f910-f061-11eb-bddb-341f92f5afbc" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/13b7f910-f061-11eb-bddb-341f92f5afbc" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
