Now, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has said that federal agencies spent $684 billion on coal plant carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects that have mostly failed, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-energy-department-blew-1-1-billion-on-carbon-captu-1848338427"><em>Gizmodo</em></a> has reported. It also spent $438 million on other three CCS industrial projects, two of which were cancelled.</p><p>&quot;DOE [Department of Energy] provided nearly $684 million to eight coal projects, resulting in one operational facility,&quot; according to the GAO report. &quot;DOE’s process for selecting coal projects and negotiating funding agreements increased the risks that DOE would fund projects unlikely to succeed.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>DOE’s process for selecting coal projects and negotiating funding agreements increased the risks that DOE would fund projects unlikely to succeed.</p></blockquote><p>Not only did the Department of Energy use a &quot;high-risk selection&quot; method to choose projects, it negotiated and funded them too expeditiously, according to the report. Coal negotiations lasted just three months instead of the usual year &quot;based on DOE&#39;s desire to begin spending American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 funds quickly.&quot; On top of that, it bypassed the usual cost controls and supported projects &quot;even though they were not meeting required key milestones.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>The DOE recently said that it wants to dramatically reduce the cost of carbon capture technology via a program called <a href="https://www.energy.gov/fecm/carbon-negative-shot">Carbon Negative Shot</a>. The aim is to remove CO2 directly from the air and sequester it underground at a cost of less than $100 per ton, deploying it at the gigaton scale.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the easiest and cheapest way to cut gigatons of emissions would be to retire costly coal plants completely, according to a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jun/23/most-new-wind-solar-projects-cheaper-than-coal-report">report last year</a> the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena). That&#39;s because the costs of renewable energy have plunged in the last decade, making them effectively cheaper than coal. And of course, adding CCS tech to coal would increase costs considerably. All that said, coal and fossil fuels are a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/07/republicans-fossil-fuels-coal">charged political subject</a> in the US, despite the global risks of climate change.&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, the GAO recommended more congressional oversight for DOE expenditures on CCS. &quot;Absent such a mechanism, DOE is at risk of expending significant funds on CCS demonstration projects that have little likelihood of success.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-us-government-spent-11-billion-on-failed-carbon-capture-projects-111225335.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c80f7a5f-9dd9-44c1-9dd5-497fc74445ab</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 11:12:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641985946</ingested><modified>2022-01-12T11:12:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Commodity Markets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0b7c8b90-738c-11ec-bb3b-d24561649329" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0b7c8b90-738c-11ec-bb3b-d24561649329" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Trish Badger / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Petra Nova CCS Facility at NRG Power Plant in Richmond, Texas, U.S., May 18, 2018.

According to <a href="https://finbold.com/lawsuit-filed-against-kim-kardashian-for-promoting-bogus-cryptocurrency-to-her-followers/"><em>Finbold</em></a>, the platintiffs sued the celebrities and the still-unidentified entities behind the tokens for causing the value of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-29-49-million-ethereum-theft.html">Ethereum</a> knockoff to soar so &quot;they could sell their portion of the Float for a profit.&quot; The lawsuit lists anybody who invested in the token between May 14th and June 27th, 2021 as a defendant.</p><p>As <a href="https://gizmodo.com/kim-kardashian-sued-for-promoting-alleged-cryptocurrenc-1848339180"><em>Gizmodo</em></a> explains, the claimants are accusing the defendants of perpetrating a &quot;pump and dump&quot; scheme, in which investors sell off their shares to make a lot of money after orchestrating a rise in its value. The lawsuit states that the coin rose 632 percent in value after Mayweather and Pierce promoted it — the boxing star wore shorts with the EthereumMax URL during his exhibition match with Logan Paul, while Pierce tweeted about it.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Meanwhile, Kardashian posted about EthereumMax on Instagram Stories, telling followers that she heard about it from her friends and linking to its website. According to <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/09/21/kim-kardashian-crypto-celebrity/">Morning Consult</a>, 19 percent of the survey respondents who said they heard about Kardiashian&#39;s post invested in EthereumMax as a result. The lawsuit states that the day after Kardashian&#39;s post, the token&#39;s value plummeted by 98 percent. Further, the coin&#39;s creators allegedly sold off their shares before the price drop, as shown by their wallet&#39;s activities.&nbsp;</p><p>Celebrities have been promoting cryptocurrency tokens for a while now and even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-01-boxer-manny-pacquiao-cryptocurrency.html">creating their own</a>.

That’s thanks to <a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/"><em>Wordle</em></a>, a new puzzle game that’s become somewhat of an obsession for many since <em>The New York Times</em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/03/technology/wordle-word-game-creator.html">wrote about</a> it just over a week ago.</p><p>Like other viral games, <em>Wordle</em> is deceptively simple: you have six chances to guess a new five-letter word. And that’s… pretty much it. There’s just one puzzle a day, and it’s free to play with no ads . Its creator, a software developer named Josh Wardle, is apparently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jan/11/wordle-creator-overwhelmed-by-global-success-of-hit-puzzle">“overwhelmed”</a> by his game’s popularity. But the fact that the game doesn’t have an app has allowed developers to create their own knockoff version of the game.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>One particularly egregious example comes from developer Zach Shakked who created an app called <em>“Wordle - The App</em>.<em>” </em>At first glance, the app, which is subtitled “<em>Word Game Everyone&#39;s Playing!</em>” could easily be mistaken for the original. The word grid looks almost the same, and it even uses the same color scheme. But Shakked’s version also asks players to sign up for a “pro” subscription that costs $29.99 after a three-day “free trial.”</p><p>But between naming the app “Wordle” and running search ads against the term in the App Store, Shakked seems to have succeeded in profiting off the popularity of the game originally created by Wardle.  “This is absurd. 450 trials at 1am last night, now at 950 and getting a new ones every minute,” he wrote in a tweet that has since been made private. “12K downloads, rank #28 word game, and #4 result for &quot;Wordle&quot; in the App Store. We&#39;re going to the fucking moon.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/d88c9160-7333-11ec-bf34-6d0830191220" alt="The developer of a knockoff version of Wordle bragged about his success copying the viral game." data-uuid="8b77922a-935a-3e85-a181-0bb833b2db23"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Screenshot via Twittet</div></figure><p>Shakked and Wardle didn’t respond to questions from Engadget. But Shakked isn’t the only developer trying to cash in on the popularity of <em>Wordle.</em> His app is one of at least six <em>Wordle</em> clones launched in the App Store in the eight days since the original <em>New York Times</em> article about <em>Wordle.</em> Another, called “What Word - Wordle”  which charges a $0.99 in-app purchase to remove ads, claims to be the “No. 1 Word game” in its App Store screenshots. (It is actually ranked No. 7 in word games, according to its App Store listing.)</p><p>Scammy knockoff apps capitalizing on the popularity of a viral game is nothing new, of course. Game developers have been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-01-28-game-cloning-sucks.html">complaining about</a> the practice for years. Apple didn’t immediately respond to questions about <em>Wordle</em> clones in its store.  But, thanks to emails released during the Epic v. Apple trial, we do know that copycat apps have long been a source of frustration for Apple executives as well. “Is no one reviewing these apps? Is no one minding the store?&quot; Phil Schiller wrote in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/06/phil-schiller-on-app-store-knockoffs-in-2012-is-no-one-reviewing-these-apps/">a 2012 email</a>. Three years later, he complained that “I can’t believe we still don’t” have automated tools to find scam apps.</p><p><strong>Update 1/11 7:52pm ET:</strong> App Store listings for the <em>Wordle</em> clones are no longer accessible, and the apps appear to have been removed from the store. We&#39;ve reached out to Apple for more information.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Update 1/11 10:05pm ET:</strong> Apple confirmed to Engadget that it had removed the games from its App Store.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/wordle-clones-app-store-232042208.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0a7c6cb7-ef4f-4082-acba-1108e966bb73</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jan 2022 23:20:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641979584</ingested><modified>2022-01-12T09:26:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/91d3dcb0-7333-11ec-bffc-bef7f2245890" width="1002" height="782" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/91d3dcb0-7333-11ec-bffc-bef7f2245890" width="1002" height="782" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Screenshot via 'Wordle']]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The one true Wordle.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Wordle]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Humble Bundle's simplified game subscription will include a members-only library]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Humble Bundle hasn&#39;t exactly won fans with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/humble-bundle-donation-cap-july-204446045.html">donation caps</a> and potentially confusing subscription tiers, but it&#39;s hoping to make some amends. As of February 1st, the company&#39;s monthly Humble Choice service is <a href="https://blog.humblebundle.com/2022/01/11/humble-choice-is-leveling-up/">consolidating</a> around a single $12 monthly plan that gives you permanent copies of every game offered in a given month. Humble noted the number of games might vary, but you can still skip a month if you don&#39;t like the selection and want to remain a member.</p><p>You&#39;ll also have access to more games so long as you&#39;re subscribed. A new Humble Games Collection gives you access to a curated, expanding catalog of titles you can access only as a Choice member. The initial mix is limited to just five games (including the relatively well-known <em>Void Bastards</em>) available through the Humble app, but the company clearly hopes the promise of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/january-ps-plus-games-persona-5-strikers-dirt-5-deep-rock-galactic-174854063.html">PlayStation Plus-</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-game-pass-pc-rebrand-035131086.html">Xbox Game Pass</a>-style library will keep you paying even when the monthly Choice selections aren&#39;t to your liking.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Choice has other <a href="https://support.humblebundle.com/hc/en-us/articles/4411127626139">modified</a> perks. You&#39;ll receive as much as a 20 percent discount on eligible games you buy in the Humble Store, but you&#39;ll have to stay subscribed for at least a year. You&#39;ll get that discount immediately if you&#39;re subscribed by February. Five percent of your membership fee will be donated to charities.</p><p>This won&#39;t thrill everyone.

Specifically, the FTC alleges Facebook used the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp in 2012 and 2014 to secure its dominant position in the social media market.</p><p>&quot;Today’s decision narrows the scope of the FTC’s case by rejecting claims about our platform policies. It also acknowledges that the agency faces a ‘tall task’ proving its case regarding two acquisitions it cleared years ago,&quot; a spokesperson for Meta told Engadget. &quot;We’re confident the evidence will reveal the fundamental weakness of the claims. Our investments in Instagram and WhatsApp transformed them into what they are today.

That&#39;s expensive compared to many conventional adjustable sets, but you might not mind if the speed of adjustments is more important than price. We&#39;d add that some adjustable sets don&#39;t offer this level of flexibility — the 5lb changes could help you ease into heavier weights over time.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nordictrack-iselect-adjustable-dumbbells-alexa-142942754.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ecfd3691-4b91-4c86-89ba-5e2ed5f401c6</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jan 2022 14:29:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641911384</ingested><modified>2022-01-11T14:29:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/58436570-72e2-11ec-b773-f87fa17e9b31" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/58436570-72e2-11ec-b773-f87fa17e9b31" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NordicTrack from iFit]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NordicTrack iSelect Adjustable Dumbbells with Alexa support]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NordicTrack iSelect Adjustable Dumbbells with Alexa support]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Nintendo Switch Online and microSD bundle is half off on Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hunkering down for the winter months can mean more time to play some new games while you stay inside. For Switch owners that want to play with friends remotely and get access to classic games, a Nintendo Switch Online membership is well worth the price. Now, Amazon has a deal on a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:bundle" href="https://amzn.to/3GgH6hl">bundle</a> that includes one year of the Switch Online family plan and a 128GB SanDisk microSD card for $35.

This particular bundle is best for those with large families, and possibly more than one Switch in the house, since up to eight users can take advantage of the membership&#39;s benefits.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>One of the things we usually recommend <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-nintendo-switch-oled-accessories-150048703.html">new Switch owners</a> buy is a microSD card since it&#39;s easy to quickly fill up the console&#39;s built-in, 64GB of storage with games. The licensed 128GB SanDisk model included in this bundle is a solid one, with read speeds up to 100 MB/s and write speeds up to 90 MB/s. Even if you don&#39;t think you&#39;ll need the extra space, you probably will as you collect more titles, save files and screenshots over time.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-online-and-microsd-bundle-is-half-off-on-amazon-141140268.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">267a8846-43f4-444f-946f-5bd9752dc1c1</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jan 2022 14:11:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641909782</ingested><modified>2022-01-11T14:03:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1261f690-72e5-11ec-ae4f-ba53ddf91562" width="1500" height="1124" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1261f690-72e5-11ec-ae4f-ba53ddf91562" width="1500" height="1124" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SanDisk]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SanDisk 128GB microSD card Nintendo Switch]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[SanDisk 128GB microSD card Nintendo Switch]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Firefox Focus for Android will offer another way to prevent cross-site tracking]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Android version of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mozilla-firefox-focus-mobile-updates-130514586.html">Firefox Focus browser</a> is getting another layer of privacy protection.

One of the latest organizations to jump into the craze is the Associated Press (AP), which will <a href="https://www.ap.org/press-releases/2022/ap-to-launch-nft-marketplace-built-by-xooa">start selling</a> its &quot;award-winning contemporary and historic photojournalism&quot; as non-fungible tokens on January 31st. The news agency teamed up with blockchain technology provider Xooa to develop a marketplace for its NFTs, which will debut with an initial collection that will be released over the coming weeks after its launch.</p><p>AP&#39;s initial collection includes digitally enhanced Pulitzer Prize-winning images across categories, such as space, climate and war. Each one will include the image&#39;s original metadata that shows the time and date it was taken, its location, and the equipment and settings the photographer used for the shot. They agency says the marketplace will allow people to buy, sell and trade the tokens, which can be purchased using credit cards and crypto wallets. The proceeds it will earn from the sales will then be used to fund its operations. One of the biggest controversies surrounding NFTs is that they have a huge <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nfts-hot-effect-earth-climate/">environmental impact</a>. AP says its NFTs will be minted on the Polygon blockchain that was designed to consume less energy than its counterparts.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Whether AP successfully sells its photos for the kind of money it&#39;s hoping to earn remains to be seen.

With rapid test kits in short supply, though, some retailers are making them unaffordable by gouging customers. Now, the Biden administration has announced that testing kits must be covered by private insurance, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-house-says-private-insurers-to-cover-rapid-covid-19-tests-starting-saturday-11641848589"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> has reported.&nbsp;</p><p>People covered by private health insurance can be reimbursed for up to eight tests a month per individual. To make things simpler, the White House is encouraging insurers to partner with retailers and pharmacies so people can pick up tests without paying up front or submitting a claim. The tests are available without deductibles, coinsurance or co-payment, so a family of four on the same health plan could be reimbursed for 32 tests a month, for instance. For such programs, reimbursement would be limited to $12 per test.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>Today’s action further removes financial barriers and expands access to Covid-19 tests for millions of people.</p></blockquote><p>The new policy doesn&#39;t apply to Medicare, which counts more than 60 million seniors at higher risk for COVID-19 complications. However, Medicaid for low income folks already covers at-home COVID-19 tests authorized by the FDA. The administration also plans to make tens of millions of free tests available to uninsured Americans at health clinics and other sites, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/10/us/politics/insurance-covid-tests.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Some insurers said that the administration is acting too late and that it didn&#39;t address the shortage of at-home tests. However, one national association of coverage providers said that the new plan &quot;takes steps to mitigate the real risks of price gouging, fraud and abuse.&quot;</p><p>Having enough diagnostic tests will be key to slowing down the Omicron wave that is starting to overwhelm health systems in the US and elsewhere. It can help get infected people isolated or into treatment more quickly, reducing potential transmission and hospital workloads.&nbsp;</p><p>That will become even more important given authorization for antiviral pills from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fda-pfizer-covid-antiviral-pill-paxlovid-205104688.html">Pfizer</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fda-merck-covid-19-antivirual-pill-molnupiravir-162951648.html">Merck</a> that can help high-risk patients with mild to moderate COVID symptoms — provided they&#39;re diagnosed in time. &quot;This policy will help millions of families afford COVID tests that allow them to be in school, visit family members and live their lives,&quot; Georgetown University&#39;s Sabrina Corlette told the <em>WSJ</em>.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/covid-tests-will-soon-be-covered-100-percent-by-insurance-132011189.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9d134014-caf5-440e-b057-86bd2a21deb8</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jan 2022 13:20:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641906683</ingested><modified>2022-01-11T13:11:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health Care Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/ebcf4a30-6e81-11ec-beb7-475697e0b288" width="4896" height="3264" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/ebcf4a30-6e81-11ec-beb7-475697e0b288" width="4896" height="3264" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Spencer Platt via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NEW YORK, NEW YORK - DECEMBER 22:  A take-home COVID-19 testing kit is displayed on the shelf of a Manhattan drugstore on December 22, 2021 in New York City.

Honor’s Magic V is its first attempt at the foldable form factor, and like Samsung&#39;s Z Fold devices, it’s a dual-screen smartphone. On the outside, it has a 6.45-inch, 431 PPI external display with a resolution of 2,560 x 1,080, 120Hz refresh rate and 21:9 aspect ratio. Open it up, and you’ll unfold a 7.9-inch screen that has a 2,272 x 1,984 resolution and 90Hz refresh rate.
