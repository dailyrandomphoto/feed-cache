The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/googles-pixel-6-can-now-be-used-to-unlock-bmw-vehicles-180000062.html">December update</a> was meant to add new features like ultra-wideband on the Pixel 6 Pro, and Quick Tap to Snap for easily accessing Snapchat from your lockscreen. Google says those features will make their way to the January fix.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The delay is something of a debacle for the company, especially since the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro were meant to show off the combined power of Google&#39;s custom processor and software.

Among the new features is hidden text to mask spoilers. So, if you can&#39;t wait to blab about what happens in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amc-sony-spider-man-no-way-home-nft-190650100.html"><em><ins>Spider-Man: No Way Home</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>before everyone in the chat has seen it, you can select any section of your text and use the Spoiler formatting. This will hide the text in the chat, notifications and chat list. When your friends are ready to read what you think about [redacted] showing up, they can tap the spoiler text to read it.</p><p>Also new are iMessage-style reactions. You can double tap any message to send a thumbs-up reaction. Tapping once (or tapping and holding on iOS) will let you select other emoji, such as a grin, fire, a shocked face or a thumbs down. You can change the default double-tap emoji in the Chat Settings on Android, and under the Stickers and Emoji section in iOS settings.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In private chats, reactions are always enabled. Channel and group admins can decide whether to switch them on and what reactions the other members can choose from.</p><p>Elsewhere, Telegram now has a useful translation option. Through the Language section in Settings, you can enable translation, which adds a Translate button to the context menu. You can nix languages you&#39;re able to understand and the Translate button won&#39;t be available on messages you receive in those languages. Translation is available on all Android devices, but iPhone and iPad users will need to be running iOS 15 or later. The number of languages Telegram supports depends on your operating system.</p><p>In addition, users can generate QR codes for anyone with a public username, as well as bots, groups and channels. You can tap the QR code icon next to their username and select the colors and pattern before sharing it elsewhere. You can find your own QR code in Settings.</p><p>The Telegram team redesigned the context menus on macOS with new shortcut hints and animated icons. The app will display a full-screen effect in one-on-one chats when you send certain emoji too.</p><p>Earlier this year, Telegram added <a href="https://www.engadget.com/telegram-group-video-calling-now-available-182705546.html"><ins>group video calls</ins></a> and other features, including a way to <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/protected-content-delete-by-date-and-more"><ins>block</ins></a> others in group chats from taking screenshots and saving shared media, as well as <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/live-streams-forwarding-next-channel"><ins>live streams</ins></a> with unlimited viewers.

The misconfigured Amazon Web Services S3 bucket contained sensitive information which allowed researchers to arbitrarily upload files to a huge swath of Sega-owned domains, as well credentials to abuse a 250,000-user email list.</p><p>The domains impacted included the official landing pages for major franchises, including Sonic the Hedgehog, Bayonetta and Total War, as well as the Sega.com site itself. VPNO was able to run executable scripts on these sites which, as you can imagine, would have been quite bad if this breach had been discovered by malicious actors instead of researchers.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>An improperly stored Mailchimp API key gave VPNO access to the aforementioned email list. The emails themselves were available in plaintext alongside associated IP addresses, and passwords that the researchers were able to un-hash. According to the report, &quot;a malicious user could have distributed ransomware very effectively using SEGA’s compromised email and cloud services.&quot;</p><p>So far there&#39;s no indication that bad actors made use of this vulnerability before VPNO discovered and helped Sega to fix it. Sega Europe was not available for comment.</p><p>Misconfigured S3 buckets are, unfortunately, an extremely common problem in information security.

Yukai Engineering, the maker of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/qoobo/"><ins>Qoobo robotic cat tail pillow</ins></a>, has revealed a soft robot that nibbles on a user’s fingertip. The company hopes the &quot;somewhat pleasing sensation&quot; will brighten up your day.</p><p><a href="https://hamham.ux-xu.com/"><ins>Amagami Ham Ham</ins></a> has an algorithm called a “Hamgorithm” that selects one of two dozen nibbling patterns, so you’ll never be sure exactly what you’ll feel when you shove your digit into the robot’s maw. Yukai designed the patterns — which include Tasting Ham, Massaging Ham and Suction Ham — to replicate the feeling of a baby or pet nibbling on one’s finger.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/cdba0260-6981-11ec-9aff-8160bca77886" style="height:281;width:500;" alt="A soft robot called Amagami Ham Ham " data-uuid="aa34e227-1d5b-36f0-8aea-5f2488291e35"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Yukai Corporation</div></figure><p>“Amagami” means “soft biting” and “ham” means “bite” in Japanese. Yukai based the look of the robot on a character from Liv Heart Corporation’s Nemu Nemu stuffed animal series. There’ll be a couple of finger-munching models to choose from: Yuzu (Calico Cat) and Kotaro (Shiba Inu).</p><p>“Most people like the nibbling sensation but know they need to teach their children or pets to stop it, because kids and animals will otherwise bite them with full force eventually,&quot; said Yukai Engineering CMO Tsubasa Tominaga, who invented the robot at a hackathon earlier this year. &quot;Amagami Ham Ham is a robot that frees humankind from the conundrum of whether ‘to pursue or not to pursue’ the forbidden pleasure.”</p><p>Pricing hasn&#39;t been determined, but Yukai and Liv Heart plan to run a crowdfunding campaign in the spring. In the meantime, those braving CES can check out Amagami Ham Ham at the show, and perhaps leave Yukai&#39;s booth with a slightly more tender finger.</p><div id="81a53a0589d9420383acb42177bbb7d6"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_GiQswlhps4?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Among the other devices Yukai will show off at CES is Bocco Emo. The company has updated the original <a href="https://japanese.engadget.com/jp-2015-05-12-bocco-kickstarter.html">Bocco robot</a> to act as a smart medical device. Yukai says hospitals in Japan are using it to monitor patients&#39; vitals (via connected sensors like pulse oximeters and thermometers) and notify nurses about a patient&#39;s condition.</p><p>During a pilot period, Bocco Emo was used to inform patients&#39; families about how they&#39;re doing.

It’s with plenty of loathing that we admit this: NFTs somehow won this year. They’ve taken over. Reddit’s day traders also deserve recognition for the way they’ve managed to manifest GameStop’s slogan, “Power to the players.”</p><p>Also (and this might be the most painful to acknowledge), the Metaverse (sorta) took off this year. At least in terms of our lexicon, with mentions of the word skyrocketing since Mark Zuckerberg uttered it while <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-q3-2021-earnings-young-adults-metaverse-220703590.html">announcing plan for a richer VR and AR-focused world</a>. Maybe people were confused between “metaverse” and “multiverse” as in <em>Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</em>?</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Besides the things we love to hate, there are some products this year we genuinely liked as well. Apple continued to impress with its M1 chips and, more importantly, gave users a way to repair their own devices (kinda). Google’s first-ever mobile chip powered clever experiences on the latest Pixel phones and showcased the company’s AI and software prowess at a competitive price. As we continue to be bombarded by depressing news every day, it’s worth taking the time to reflect on the wins this year, no matter how tiny.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/bc783520-626b-11ec-8efa-762a1008a7f7" alt="NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JUNE 28: Digital artist FEWOCiOUS auctions five new unique NFT works of art, along with five physical paintings and never-before-seen drawings in a collection titled " data-uuid="b0827a8c-add6-3fb2-93e6-c4be1e3f9e8b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Noam Galai via Getty Images</div></figure><h2>NFTs</h2><p>2021 has not been a quiet year, so NFTs deserve something approaching praise for securing a spot in the highlights reel. NFTs, or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nft-explainer-digital-art-collectibles-blockchain-environment-business-investment-cryptocurrency-153023551.html">Non-Fungible Tokens</a>, are an attempt to create an immutable digital asset in an environment where such a thing has historically been tricky. For the industry’s proponents, it’s a way of imposing some form of scarcity on digital artifacts that you can’t easily make scarce. Anyone can right-click and save a picture of a monkey wearing sunglasses and a Hawaiian shirt after all. But only the person who paid a lot of money for the NFT can go around calling themselves the “owner” of the same. As Nietzche didn’t say, NFTs are the lie agreed upon, suggesting that people respect the owner of the certificated copy of something over everything else.</p><p>So far, the biggest and most notable moves in the NFT space have happened in the art market, with pieces being bought and sold for eye-watering numbers. On March 11th, digital artist Beeple sold <em>Everydays: The First 5,000 Days</em> at <a href="https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/beeple-first-5000-days/beeple-b-1981-1/112924">Christie’s auction house</a> for $69,346,250. Those hefty sums are, in some people’s minds, justified because they believe that NFTs will become the new crypto, with everyone trying to get aboard the bandwagon before it goes big. After all, there are lots of folks who got rich during the Bitcoin boom that want to further enhance their fortunes, while some who were left behind now hope to get in on the ground floor on the next big thing. Others, meanwhile, think that the big craze in NFTs right now is to help folks move large quantities of <a href="https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/nfts-new-frontier-money-laundering">money around</a> away from the auspices of, you know, <em>regulators</em>.</p><p>The NFT market is so awash with speculator cash that it’s normal to have... questions. A recent <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/11/how-nfts-create-value"><em>Harvard Business Review</em></a> article talks about how commerce can’t work without “clear property rights,” which NFTs help to impose. There’s also the matter of whether NFTs could better enable more reliable and secure ticketing and permission systems? I’ll be honest, I’m personally unconvinced by the argument that NFTs offer rights of ownership, since they don’t necessarily confer upon the buyer the proper rights of ownership.</p><div id="689eca03462645eb968606cf3f25db75"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mrNOYudaMAc?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>These issues are, however, going to be worked out over the next few years, and it will only be when the speculation has died down that we’ll see if NFTs have any residual worth. And, hey, not every deeply-technical cryptographic ownership record gets their own SNL sketch shortly after they broke into the mainstream, do they.</p><p>— <em>Daniel Cooper</em></p><h2>The Metaverse</h2><p>Mark Zuckerberg didn&#39;t invent the term, but by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-name-meta-182151399.html">rebadging Facebook as &quot;Meta,&quot;</a> he helped kick off a wave of interest in the metaverse. While it was originally a dystopian view of cyberspace via Neal Stephenson&#39;s Snow Crash, the metaverse now represents the next big online goldrush. You can think of it as the logical step forward from the mobile internet, a world where our online experiences can easily transition between multiple devices. And eventually, it could be something we interact with via AR and VR glasses.</p><p>To be clear, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-metaverse-meta-explained-or-not-120032885.html">we still don&#39;t have an exact idea</a> of what the metaverse will be. The Meta renaming could easily be seen as a way for Zuckerberg to avoid his responsibilities as the leader of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whats-in-the-facebook-papers-and-what-it-means-for-the-company-194502237.html">a fundamentally broken social media company</a>. But other companies have been exploring this idea for years: Microsoft&#39;s HoloLens has proven to be surprisingly useful for commercial and front-line workers, and it&#39;s also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-mesh-holograms-hololens-ar-vr-164001796.html">core to Mesh</a>, the company&#39;s ambitious solution for virtual meetings. The Borg-like Google Glass was widely ridiculed, but its failure hasn&#39;t stopped Google from thinking about <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-17/google-ceo-sees-company-s-next-trillion-in-value-from-search-ai">its role in the metaverse</a>, either.</p><p>Maybe it&#39;ll take a killer new device, like<a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ar-vr-headset-iphone-requirement-chip-175931492.html"> Apple&#39;s fabled AR glasses</a>, to bring the metaverse into focus. Or maybe it&#39;ll go the way of wearables — a category of devices that&#39;s useful for some people, but not necessarily essential for everyone. Either way, it&#39;s something that will forever be tied to 2021.</p><p>— <em>Devindra Hardawar</em></p><h2>Home fitness tech is here to stay</h2><p>As the pandemic kept many of us indoors and out of gyms, companies like Peloton, Apple, Tonal and even Amazon were able to pull us into new fitness habits and equipment.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/227f4f60-4aef-11eb-beb3-07edc2f2bd9f" alt="Apple Fitness Plus" data-uuid="c805e4d7-fd68-3d4a-836f-496ebac6df1b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>Meanwhile, major fitness studios and gyms like Equinox, Soulcycle, OrangeTheory and F45 have modulated (while some created from scratch) their online services. Many companies expanded replayable class options or added live lessons, leaderboards and more in a bid to keep members fit – and keep those membership dues coming in.</p><p>COVID-19 offered a chance to shift our workout habits and reduce gym costs. Why pay $50 for a high-intensity interval training gym membership when I can track myself in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-fitness-plus-review-two-weeks-test-watch-music-workout-160058155.html">Apple’s Fitness Plus classes</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ios-15-review-150030599.html">SharePlay with my friends</a> and jump in my own shower, all for just $10 a month?</p><p>Of course, the comparison isn’t oranges for oranges, and despite cheerleading Peloton trainers and form corrections from gym coaches over video livestreams, it’s very hard to get the degree of attention gained from in-person training. That’s likely one reason why at-home exercise injuries have never been higher. <em>The Wall Street Journal </em>reported that emergency room visits after home workouts increased by more than 48% from the end of 2019 through the end of 2020, according to a survey by Medicare Advantage.</p><p>However, just like traditional gyms did when the pandemic first hit, these businesses have to figure out how to hold onto their customers.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/8879dac0-626c-11ec-b73b-713465923241" alt="A woman using the Tonal wall-mounted workout system, performing a pulldown.

When our usual bench-press machines and squat racks were locked inside gyms over the last year and a half, Tonal saw demand for its resistance-training system rocket. Sales grew more than eight times year-over-year. In a bid to hold onto these new customers, the company recently introduced live classes for Tonal owners, with direct feedback from coaches and classes reportedly calibrated for each user.</p><p>Meanwhile, Peloton, arguably the most recognizable at-home fitness company, faces more competition from (and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peloton-lawsuit-patent-infringement-on-demand-classes-202028622.html">litigation</a> with) rivals and a tougher business outlook.

It’s integrated into many corporate fitness plans, launched its first exercise game, announced a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peloton-guide-machine-learning-strength-training-152637209.html">fitness camera for strength training</a> and finally — added <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peloton-bike-plus-pause-button-tread-205410305.html">a pause button</a>.</p><p>The challenge will be keeping many of us from returning to our old gyms, cycling commutes, or our old, less healthy habits when things eventually return to normal.</p><p>— <em>Mat Smith</em></p><section data-eng-breakout="2b67b5bad8604c02906e1185f2ed51b5" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/e3384af0-626c-11ec-bff6-49155c024622" alt="An illustration showing a person using tools to repair a gadget while looking at a tablet."></section><h2>Apple takes baby steps toward the right to repair</h2><p>Apple continued to impress the industry with its M1 Pro and M1 Max chips this year, putting them in new MacBooks that garnered <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-book-pro-14-16-inch-review-2021-apple-mighty-macs-130011975.html">rave reviews</a>. And though <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-review-120-hz-promotion-screen-macro-camera-cinematic-mode-samples-battery-life-143041678.html">the iPhone 13 Pro</a> is just catching up to Android phones with its 120Hz screen, it&#39;s an undeniably good device with solid cameras and excellent performance. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-review-all-about-the-screen-130036181.html">Apple Watch Series 7</a> isn&#39;t much different from its predecessor, barring its larger display, but it&#39;s still the best smartwatch around. Plus, Apple TV+ gained much more credibility in 2021 with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-and-apple-tv-clean-up-at-the-emmys-with-the-crown-and-ted-lasso-053901458.html">giant pile of awards its original series <em>Ted Lasso</em></a> brought home.</p><p>But the biggest thing that Apple did this year was to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-user-iphone-repair-policy-change-173047862.html">start selling DIY iPhone and Mac repair kits</a> to consumers. After it was discovered Face ID on an iPhone 13 would stop working if a third party replaced its screen, the company first issued a software fix for this specific issue and announced the repair kits shortly after. The move was hailed by activists as a victory for the right-to-repair movement, given the company’s history of making it obnoxiously difficult for you to get your Apple products fixed by anyone else.</p><p>Of course, Apple could still do better — activists say the company’s plans could be more comprehensive, for example. But this is a major reversal of policy that shows the company is opening up, ever so slightly. Last year, it allowed users to set third-party browsers and email apps as their <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-14-change-default-apps-email-browser-195555516.html">default on iPhones and iPads</a>. This year, it introduced FaceTime on the web as a means to allow PC and Android users to join calls that they had previously been excluded from. The company may never fully embrace integrating different ecosystems into its walled garden, but it seems they’re at least listening to what people want and taking small steps towards giving users what they deserve.</p><p>— <em>Cherlynn Low</em></p><h2>Gamestop</h2><p>At the start of 2021, Gamestop’s share price was $17.25.

This year has been so long that it’s easy to forget many things that happened in January, including the Reddit-driven short squeeze that pushed Gamestop’s stock price to as high as $500 at its peak. Despite subsequent criticism, calls for better regulation, a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/reddit-gamestop-squeeze-congress-hearings-002519817.html">congressional hearing on</a> what <a href="https://www.engadget.com/robinhood-reddit-ceo-testify-house-gamestop-hearing-152845471.html">happened</a> and multiple class-action lawsuits having been filed against <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gamestop-reddit-wallstreetbets-roaring-kitty-lawsuit-204813659.html">parties</a> like brokering app Robinhood, here we are 12 months later with the company’s stock still higher than it’s ever been before 2021.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/0e4123d0-58f3-11ec-8fb3-38f4c87c9875" alt="People walk by a GameStop in Manhattan, New York, U.S., December 7, 2021.

But this is a far cry from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-15-gamestop-store-renovations.html">2019</a> when GameStop was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-11-gamestop-to-close-over-200-stores.html">posting tens of millions in losses and planning to shutter up to 200 stores</a>. In 2020, its main challenges were around trying to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-20-gamestop-essential.html">keep its outlets open</a> in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-20-gamestop-closes-california-stores.html">face of stay-home mandates</a> and making sure it had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gamestop-ps5-preorder-restrock-203545363.html">enough consoles to sell</a>.</p><p>This year, in possibly the most 2021 combination of words ever, GameStop announced it’s working on an <a href="https://nft.gamestop.com/">NFT platform</a> based on Ethereum. It also <a href="https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-financial-results-q2-2021">signed a lease for a new 530,000 square-foot fulfilment center</a> in Nevada and opened a new customer care center in Florida. It made $1.18 billion in the second quarter compared to $942 million in the same period in 2020. That could partly be due to the fact that Sony and Microsoft launched their consoles after the second quarter in 2020. Basically, 2021 has been a great year for GameStop, and not just for its business.</p><p>Discovery+ is even working on a documentary (narrated by “Wolf of Wall Street” Jordan Belfort) on the entire fiasco titled <em>GameStop:The Wall Street Hijack</em>. Nine other films based on these events are reportedly in the works, according to <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2021/02/inside-hollywoods-rush-to-make-the-first-gamestop-movie.html"><em>Vulture</em></a>. Gamestop wasn’t the only company that Reddit’s day traders flocked to in their nostalgia-driven frenzy, either. Companies like BlackBerry and AMC also saw their share prices surge, with the latter’s stock <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze#Other_affected_assets">jumping 480 percent</a> at its peak.

I&#39;d bet even Microsoft was surprised it managed to make that happen.</p><p>Windows 11 rose from the ashes of Windows 10X, an OS variant that was originally supposed to focus on dual-screen devices, but was eventually canceled in May. That would explain why Windows 11 feels more like a fresh coat of paint on its predecessor. But despite that inauspicious start, it&#39;s still a worthwhile update: there&#39;s more of an emphasis on security, and the facelift brings some Mac-like pleasantries into the typically stark world of Windows.</p><p>It&#39;s not a complete success — upgrading is an annoying process if you&#39;ve got a self-built PC, and very old computers won&#39;t be able to upgrade at all (at least, not without going through <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-windows-11-supported-processors-update-175544403.html">a manual ISO installation</a>). But at the very least, Microsoft managed to keep most of what made <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-windows-11-supported-processors-update-175544403.html">Windows 10 such a successful operating system</a>, while also delivering a more mindful experience for PC users.</p><p>— <em>D.

Sure, it was one of the first to try its hand at foldables, but it&#39;s also arguably the last one standing.

The original Mate X and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-15-samsung-galaxy-fold-hands-on-price-release-date.html">Galaxy Fold</a> made the rounds at various press events after, but only Samsung eventually sold its first-gen foldable to the general public (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-23-huawei-mate-x-china-november-15.html">outside of China</a>, anyway).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7243b550-0754-11ec-9fca-3bf7ca5ab8c0" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 laying open, flat on its back, on a window ledge." data-uuid="e5202088-1b98-3058-86d9-fd11f48eae8b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>Motorola <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-13-motorola-razr-foldable-hands-on-preview-2019.html">jumped on the trend</a>, capitalizing on the sheer nostalgia value of its Razr Flip phone. Alas, all these initial attempts were doomed to fail. Foldables, it turns out, with their soft, vulnerable displays and damage-prone hinges, are hard to nail. Worse, the Razr Flip&#39;s screen just <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-14-motorola-razr-review-2020-foldable-fashion-statement.html">felt weird and flimsy</a>, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-07-motorola-razr-cnet-fold-test.html">its hinge</a> would make a cracking sound when you open or close the phone.</p><p>After a slew of reports of broken review units, Samsung returned with updated iterations of the Fold. It also released the Flip series, a smaller, Razr-like version that received its share of early complaints. Yet, today, Samsung not only continues to produce these foldables, but at cheaper prices, too. The Z series is now in its third generation, and Samsung said it shipped four times more foldables in 2021 than in 2020. While Huawei also unveiled a third version this year, its foldables haven’t been available in most places outside of China. We&#39;ve also yet to see a new version of the Razr this year, although Motorola did roll out a 5G-capable update in 2020 that we never got to test. Companies like Oppo and Xiaomi have also unveiled their own foldables recently, but they’re relatively new to the game.</p><p>By bringing the price of the Z Flip 3 down to a more competitive $999 while continuing to improve the durability and usefulness of its products, Samsung has shown it may be the only company with the resources and expertise to continue to deliver foldable phones, even if they may never gain mainstream popularity.</p><p>— <em>C.L.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/best-tech-products-and-companies-2021-143005186.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9b3840c7-dcc6-4b3d-9e1d-13c056b3e7c3</guid><dc:creator>Engadget</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 14:30:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640878305</ingested><modified>2021-12-30T15:44:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Engadget]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/6db401c0-641f-11ec-becf-13c992f13693" width="2024" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/6db401c0-641f-11ec-becf-13c992f13693" width="2024" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tech year in review winners]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tech year in review winners]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tesla recalls nearly half a million cars over camera and trunk defects]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tesla&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-had-a-phenomenal-2021-150044600.html">recall-filled 2021</a> isn&#39;t over quite yet. <em>Bloomberg</em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-30/tesla-recalls-over-475-000-u-s-cars-on-camera-trunk-issues?sref=10lNAhZ9">reports</a> Tesla has issued recalls for just over 475,000 vehicles to fix defects in camera systems and trunks. To start, the automaker has <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2021/RCLRPT-21V00D-5923.PDF">recalled</a> all Model 3 cars in the 2017 to 2020 model years over a concern repeated use of the trunk may wear down a coaxial cable for the rearview camera — too much use and you may lose the signal entirely.</p><p>The other <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2021/RCLRPT-21V00B-6667.PDF">recall</a> covers 119,009 Model S sedans in the 2014 to 2021 model years.

However, the recalls cap a series of issues that include an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-autopilot-investigation-nhtsa-141310451.html">NHTSA investigation</a> over Autopilot safety, recalls for components like touchscreens, and complaints about build quality problems like panel gaps.

One of the steps it has taken to comply with Apple&#39;s guidelines is to limit the results for certain tags or search terms that Tumblr says &quot;may fall under the expanded definition of sensitive content.&quot; The website will even completely block some of them — make that more than some, based on this pretty <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YG7E84Dvs2PyoKMgSgZFgEX0Kh0RtJqsazZsyVGY8dk/mobilebasic">lengthy list</a> of banned and limited terms collected by Tumblr users that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/29/tumblr-ios-tags-ban-apple/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> posted.&nbsp;</p><p>While the inclusion of specific words in the list is self explanatory, it also has some curious entries, such as &quot;Eugene Levy&quot; and &quot;Tony the Tiger.&quot; The restriction will also make it harder to search for content related to mental health, such as PTSD, depression and anxiety, as well as issues like racism and transphobia. Those searching for a blocked tag will get a screen that says &quot;This content has been hidden&quot; instead of a page with results. They&#39;ll see the same notification if they try to access a blog that&#39;s been flagged as &quot;explicit&quot; on the app. Users may also see fewer suggestions under the &quot;stuff for you&quot; and &quot;following&quot; sections due to the new restrictions.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Tumblr has implemented these changes three years after it started completely <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-03-tumblr-blocking-adult-content-december-17th.html">blocking adult content</a> on its platform. If you&#39;ll recall, Tumblr prohibited adult content in 2018 after Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-20-tumblr-pulled-app-store-child-exploitation.html">pulled</a> its app from iTunes in response to finding child exploitation photos on the website. The social network said these changes only apply to its iOS app and that they won&#39;t affect anyone browsing Tumblr on the web or on Android. A spokesperson also told <em>TechCrunch</em> that the company is &quot;working on more thoughtful solutions which will be rolled out in the near future.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tumblr-ios-tags-restriction-115024668.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">93fa43d5-aa41-4218-9381-480724b1d0dd</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 11:50:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640864868</ingested><modified>2021-12-30T11:47:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2018-12/e560f4a0-f724-11e8-bbfd-8a61f9182b6e" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2018-12/e560f4a0-f724-11e8-bbfd-8a61f9182b6e" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Thomas White / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Tumblr application is seen on a mobile phone in this illustration photo March 7, 2018.

Samsung shipped four times more foldables in 2021 than what it did in 2020, the tech giant has <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/a-decade-in-the-making-how-samsung-foldables-are-defining-the-future-of-smartphone-innovation">revealed</a>. Further, it took only one month after they were released for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review-s-pen-camera-battery-test-190051606.html">Galaxy Z Fold 3</a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review-price-specs-cameras-screen-170051882.html">Galaxy Z Flip 3</a> to exceed the total accumulative sales of their predecessors last year. The company also said that it saw a &quot;massive increase&quot; in consumers who jumped brands specifically for its foldable phones — in fact, more people switched to Samsung for the Flip 3 than for its flagship devices.&nbsp;</p><p>While Samsung didn&#39;t rattle off specific numbers, it said it saw a 150 percent increase in consumers who switched brands for the Flip 3 compared to the Galaxy Note 20. It saw a 140 percent increase in people switching brands for the foldable compared to the Galaxy S21, as well. The Flip&#39;s form factor is of course its main draw, along with its front screen that gives users a way to use their phone without having to open it. As for the Fold 3, people who responded to Samsung&#39;s survey said they got it for its large screen, multitasking capabilities and S Pen support.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In its post, Samsung said foldables are expected to grow tenfold by 2023, and it&#39;s heavily investing in research and development to be able to keep up with rival devices that will surely pop up.

That&#39;s mostly due to predominantly black and white color options, with a few brightly-hued variants tossed in along the way. Even if the buds are tiny, they&#39;re still highly visible due to their color. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-10-jlab-go-air-review-29-dollar-true-wireless-earbuds.html">JLab</a> is on a quest to remedy this and the audio company teamed up with nail care brand ORLY to develop a solution. With <a href="https://www.jlab.com/TONES">the Go Air Tones</a>, the duo selected a collection of seven Pantone colors that are &quot;flattering for people across a spectrum of skin tones.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>JLab says it worked with ORLY to select the final hues from an original collection of over 60 options. Given the beauty brand&#39;s experience with creating nude nail polishes, the seven colors &quot;encompassed a variety of skin tones with a mix of warm, neutral and cool undertones. While the colors reflect actual skin tones, most users will find the colors &quot;flattering&quot; without an exact match, according to JLab. If you&#39;re having trouble selecting the best option, JLab offers <a href="https://www.jlab.com/pages/fitting-room">an AR fitting room</a> for a virtual try-on that might help you decide.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/599715c0-68f6-11ec-9757-e551f6b92a1c" style="height:1334;width:2000;" alt="JLab Go Air Tones" data-uuid="1b50bcad-bf48-3149-ad0b-c612acf6aba7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">JLab</div></figure><p>The Go Air Tones are the same earbuds as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jlab-go-air-pop-true-wireless-earbuds-20-dollars-130024634.html">the $20 Go Air Pop</a> that JLab debuted back in August. This means you&#39;ll get on-board touch controls, the ability to use either bud on its own, a collection of EQ presets and IPX4 protection from moisture.

So we turned off the Switch, hooked up my laptop and started up <a href="https://amzn.to/3ppDbbX"><em>Jackbox Party Pack 8</em></a> instead.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you live in a friendless cave and aren’t familiar with Jackbox, it’s a pretty great series: Each “Party Pack” has five party games that anyone can join in with their phone (or any web browser) by going to Jackbox.tv and inputting the special room code. The narrator explains how to play and walks the group through each round — which makes it pretty great for those guests who aren’t paying attention or are super, super drunk. Most of the games involve drawing, trivia or writing silly words. (My particular favorite is ‘Mad Verse City’ from <em>Jackbox Party Pack 5</em>, a rap game.)</p><div id="0d9cdd47dad8453aa5f58475b6f5825b"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tzY1YlPAHWw?rel=0&amp;start=4" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>After everyone left, I decided to give <em>Let’s Play! Oink Games</em> another try. And, while it isn’t an alternative to Jackbox (it’s more like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Clubhouse-Games-Worldwide-Classics-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B086Z9D3TD?crid=2XRGNV120KACL&amp;keywords=clubhouse%2Bgames&amp;qid=1640550977&amp;sprefix=clubhouse%2Bgames%2Caps%2C84&amp;sr=8-1&amp;th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=cctbuyersguide21-20&amp;linkId=b03eeb789ae6988409cb504fc495e7c6&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"><em>Clubhouse Games</em></a>, if anything), it is still a somewhat fun experience, though not worth the $22 I spent.</p><p>There are only four games included with the set: <em>Startups</em>, <em>Deep Sea Adventure</em>, <em>A Fake Artist Goes to New York</em>, and<em>‘Moon Adventure</em>. They’re all computerized versions of Oink’s tabletop games, which come in little card-deck-sized boxes and usually cost $20 each. In that respect, the video game version does seem like a good deal. You have a choice to play online with either people you know or strangers, offline with people you know, or offline with CPU opponents.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/60dbdc30-68ba-11ec-b4be-f2103e0f49f2" style="height:720;width:1280;" alt="Let&#39;s Play! Oink Games: A Fake Artist Goes to New York" data-uuid="f6a44e25-d847-337a-9fe7-92d83cd0608e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Oink Games</div></figure><p>Offline with friends wasn’t happening since, as I pointed out earlier, you all need your own copy of the game and a console. I tried to find an online match, only to discover there weren’t any going on. So my only choice was offline with CPU opponents.</p><p>Unfortunately, <em>A Fake Artist Goes to New York</em> can’t be played with CPU opponents, as it’s a drawing game where all the players but one are given a prompt, and you have to figure out who the “fake” artist is. I also discovered that <em>Moon Adventure</em> can have multiple players, but the user is tasked with playing them all since it’s a cooperative game. So it’s really a battle with resource management as you attempt to gather supplies before your oxygen runs out. I found this one the toughest of all, even after looking at the helpful instructions and videos the game builds in. For all my qualms with the title, the instructions are really well-done.</p><section data-eng-breakout="2742e1a9b51d417f80b25d1fd37d7e80" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/60dbdc30-68ba-11ec-ae3f-ea886448a402" alt="Let&#39;s Play! Oink Games: Startup game" data-uuid="47d7e165-937a-3dd7-8a72-dfa21d2d62fe"></section><p>However, the instructions didn’t get me any closer to winning Startups, one of the two games where CPU players can participate. And man, are they merciless. The idea is to gather as many “shares” in a company as possible, but if you don’t have the most you end up having to pay out to the person who does. It’s like a modern version of Monopoly where you land on Boardwalk all the time. At least this one plays a lot quicker.</p><p>The last game, <em>Deep Sea Adventure</em>, is my favorite. It’s sort of competitive and sort of cooperative, as all the players must share the same oxygen supply and diving too deep will deplete it quickly. Once I got into the rhythm of gathering treasure and running back to the sub as soon as possible I mastered the game and was regularly kicking CPU butt.</p><p>While it was perhaps unfair of me to expect <em>Let’s Play: Oink Games</em> to be a <em>Jackbox</em> replacement, there’s still a lot of room for growth in what they have. I’d like to see a mode where users who don’t own the game can play on their own systems with a person who does, similar to how Mario Kart used to work on the DS. And I do hope they add more games, if only because this is an easier way to learn how to play instead of trying to puzzle out badly translated print instructions from Japanese, which is what you deal with in the physical versions.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lets-play-oink-games-jackbox-irl-160044668.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1f34e139-156c-4e52-9aff-6ea33e024c73</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 29 Dec 2021 16:00:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640791766</ingested><modified>2021-12-29T15:29:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Career & Education]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/aab0c500-68ba-11ec-8dba-075611dce43a" width="1024" height="576" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/aab0c500-68ba-11ec-8dba-075611dce43a" width="1024" height="576" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Oink Games]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Let's Play!

It borrows from the familiar open-world formula popularized by Assassin&#39;s Creed and other Ubisoft titles. But that&#39;s not a knock against it. Far from it, Sucker Punch&#39;s latest is so easy to recommend because it executes the open-world concept flawlessly. The studio has created a beautiful playground steeped in Feudal Japanese culture, myth and history for players to explore, with something interesting to find beyond every ridge. Combat is also a highlight, allowing you to play either as honorable samurai, terrifying assassin or a mixture of both. And once you have finished Tsushima&#39;s touching single-player story, there&#39;s the excellent Legends multiplayer mode to keep you busy for the long haul.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3DoOK6V" id="8cca6577bcfa422c9cbc1fe8e655767a" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Ghosts of Tsushima at Amazon - $70</a><h2><em>Hades</em></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/6e2e84d0-5e80-11ec-af3f-d8aa5082c7a8" alt="Hades" data-uuid="70b79343-2107-321e-8766-ba56e8ec0f63"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Supergiant Games</div></figure><p>If you pick up only one game from this list, make it <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Hades" href="https://amzn.to/3GahZMK"><em>Hades</em></a>.
