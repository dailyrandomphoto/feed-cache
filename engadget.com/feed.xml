It’s a real-world environment to test future autonomous technologies that could be used to refine autonomous valet parking into a product. Opening in September, the facility will also enable these companies to test if it’s possible to introduce automatic smart charging into the system.</p><p>The Detroit Smart Parking Lab is designed to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-bosch-automated-parking-solution-detroit-103506308.html">continue work showcased last summer</a>, when Ford and Bosch showed off a self-parking Ford Escape in that same building. The vehicle was able to drive through the car park without human assistance, find a space, and reverse park into it without any stress. It’s hoped that, in some far-flung future when climate change doesn’t kill us all, that this sort of automatic valet parking could free people up to spend more time doing anything other than fighting for a space in a multi-storey car park.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As well as Ford and Bosch, rental company Enterprise is going to test how this technology could streamline its own processes. It hopes that cars that drive themselves to a valet station, then recharge themselves before parking back on the lot ready for pickup will reduce dead time between rentals. At this stage, at least, the hope is to just get the cars to park themselves in a manner that’s cost-effective for the company.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/detroit-smart-parking-lab-ford-bosch-enterprise-autonomous-valet-094708875.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3143d6aa-5c8c-4cc7-bf44-196ef53d50a1</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 06 Aug 2021 09:47:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628243231</ingested><modified>2021-08-06T09:47:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6944fc50-f699-11eb-bd77-0606559683f5" width="880" height="495" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6944fc50-f699-11eb-bd77-0606559683f5" width="880" height="495" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[DSPL]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Concept render]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Detroit Smart Parking Lab]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Virgin Galactic starts selling tickets to space again for $450,000 per seat]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You now have a chance to purchase a seat aboard one of Virgin Galactic&#39;s space tours — provided you can afford to pay $450,000 for it.

After that, the company will take a break until mid-2022 to refurbish VMS Eve, its jet-powered carrier aircraft.

With the release of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-public-beta-testing-hands-on-172526761.html">iOS 15</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watchos-8-beta-hands-on-175457215.html">watchOS 8</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-os-monterey-preview-public-beta-175927010.html">macOS Monterey</a> later this year, the company says it will introduce a variety of child safety features across Messages, Photos and Siri.&nbsp;</p><p>To start, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-messages-ios-15-shared-with-you-173052730.html">Messages app</a> will include new notifications that will warn children, as well as their parents, when they either send or receive sexually explicit photos. When someone sends a child an inappropriate image, the app will blur it and display several warnings. &quot;It&#39;s not your fault, but sensitive photos and videos can be used to hurt you,&quot; says one of the notifications, per a screenshot Apple shared.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As an additional precaution, the company says Messages can also notify parents if their child decides to go ahead and view a sensitive image. &quot;Similar protections are available if a child attempts to send sexually explicit photos,&quot; according to Apple. The company notes the feature uses on-device machine learning to determine whether a photo is explicit. Moreover, Apple does not have access to the messages themselves. This feature will be available to family iCloud accounts.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple will also introduce new software tools in iOS and iPadOS that will allow the company to detect when someone uploads content to iCloud that shows children involved in sexually explicit acts. The company says it will use the technology to notify the <a href="https://www.missingkids.org/HOME">National Center for Missing and Exploited Children</a> (NCMEC), which will in turn work with law enforcement agencies across the US. &quot;Apple’s method of detecting known CSAM [Child Sexual Abuse Material] is designed with user privacy in mind,&quot; the company claims.&nbsp;</p><p>Rather than scanning photos when they&#39;re uploaded to the cloud, the system will use an on-device database of &quot;known&quot; images provided by NCMEC and other organizations. The company says that the database assigns a hash to the photos, which acts as a kind of digital fingerprint for them.</p><p>A cryptographic technology called private set intersection allows Apple to determine if there&#39;s a match without seeing the result of the process. In the event of a match, an iPhone or iPad will create a cryptographic safety voucher that will encrypt the upload, along with additional data about it.  Another technology called threshold secret sharing makes it so that the company can&#39;t see the contents of those vouchers unless someone passes an unspecified threshold of CSAM content. &quot;The threshold is set to provide an extremely high level of accuracy and ensures less than a one in one trillion chance per year of incorrectly flagging a given account,&quot; according to the company.&nbsp;</p><p>It&#39;s only when that line is passed that the technology Apple plans to implement will allow the company to review the contents of the vouchers. At that point, the tech giant says it will manually review each report to confirm there&#39;s a match. In cases where there is one, it will disable the individual&#39;s iCloud account and forward a report to NEMEC. Users can appeal a suspension if they believe their account has been mistakenly flagged.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c3429780-f62b-11eb-a3f3-7ed00c1cb0cb" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="Siri Child Safety" data-uuid="4e706bda-0929-30f5-baf3-3f9956d659ce"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>Lastly, Siri, as well as the built-in search feature found in iOS and macOS, will point users to child safety resources. For instance, you&#39;ll be able to ask the company&#39;s digital assistant how to report child exploitation. Apple also plans to update Siri to intervene when someone tries to conduct any CSAM-related searches. The assistant will explain &quot;that interest in this topic is harmful and problematic,&quot; as well as point the person to resources that offer help with the issue.</p><p>Apple&#39;s decision to effectively work with law enforcement agencies is likely to be seen as something of an about-face for the company. In 2016, it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-02-18-fbi-apple-iphone-explainer.html">refused to help the FBI</a> unlock the iPhone that had belonged to the man behind the San Bernardino terror attack. Although the government eventually <a href="https://www.engadget.com/azimuth-apple-fbi-san-bernardino-iphone-unlock-141617737.html">turned</a> to an outside firm to access the device, Tim Cook called the episode &quot;chilling&quot; and warned it could create a backdoor for more government surveillance down the road.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-child-safety-ios-15-193820644.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">aa253604-9ebc-4579-8249-e24e06de42a5</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 05 Aug 2021 19:39:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628197782</ingested><modified>2021-08-05T21:10:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b9df60b0-f621-11eb-af5f-70693fc0d782" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b9df60b0-f621-11eb-af5f-70693fc0d782" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple Child Safety iOS15]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Child Safety iOS15]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Xbox will host another indie games showcase on August 10th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/microsoft"><ins>Microsoft</ins></a> will host its second ID@Xbox indie game showcase of the year on Twitch next week.

And, when can I play again? Turns out, right now.</p><p>The <em>Back 4 Blood</em> open beta runs from August 5th to 9th, and again from August 12th to 16th, on PC, Xbox and PlayStation consoles. I got a sneak peek at what the beta has to offer on PC, with an emphasis on PvE content, since there were some technical issues with PvP modes during my playtime. Those have been resolved and I’m told PvP is ready to rock for the open beta.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Not that you should expect it to be perfect. Turtle Rock Studios is using the open beta to fine-tune <em>Back 4 Blood</em> ahead of its release on October 12th, and developers are serious about gathering as much feedback as possible. There’s plenty to track: The game uses a <em>Left 4 Dead</em>-style AI director that adjusts the difficulty level in real-time as you plow through hordes of Ridden in your own special way. There’s also a card system that allows players to build decks of class-specific perks, plus corruption cards that apply randomized effects to every level, changing up the gameplay each time. And it’s a true cross-platform game, running across console generations and PC. All of this is on top of a new PvP mode and the core PvE gameplay, which has to feel like butter if it’s going to satisfy Turtle Rock’s <em>Left 4 Dead</em> fans.</p><p>I’m one of those fans, and I have to say, I’m enjoying the hell out of <em>Back 4 Blood</em>. <em>Left 4 Dead</em> is a pivotal game of my past, and <em>Back 4 Blood</em> taps into those good feelings in a delicious way.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/ab3c43c0-f559-11eb-ab7e-ac448a03b8fe" alt="Back 4 Blood" data-uuid="53d17609-be4b-31b0-904d-74bbfae41d6d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Turtle Rock Studios</div></figure><p>I’m most interested in PvE, since that’s the core of my nostalgia in this case, and I ended up playing about two hours of the main co-op mode with some new friends.<em>&nbsp;</em>The open beta features two PvE maps for co-op runs and two maps for the Swarm PvP mode, where teams of four take turns fighting each other as the Cleaners (the main characters) and the Ridden (the infected former humans). A new character, Mom, joins the roster of playable Cleaners for the first time, too.</p><p>One thing that stands out in <em>Back 4 Blood</em> is its sense of replayability. While the levels feel familiar, they’re filled with secrets and they naturally encourage dynamic play, offering various ways to approach any single encounter. The card system adds a lovely layer of customization to the game, while the corruption cards make each new round just a little different, just a little more exciting. There’s a variety of weapons and items to gather as well, and a healthy allotment of ammo drops throughout the maps, especially if you go exploring.&nbsp;</p><p>Shooting the Ridden is immensely satisfying with any gun, while getting snatched up or knocked down by a Special Ridden is shocking basically every time. Meanwhile, the dialogue among the Cleaners is cute, with references to “the new normal,” lizard people in the government and the lamestream media, to name a few joke opportunities. The protagonists of <em>Back 4 Blood </em>aren’t shocked and running for their lives; they’re on a mission to eradicate the Ridden and create safe zones for human life to resume. It’s a refreshing perspective twist.</p><p>I ran into a few issues during my time with <em>Back 4 Blood</em>’s open beta content, but nothing that felt insurmountable at this stage of development. Essentially, I trust Turtle Rock to take the feedback from the open beta and apply it to the game in the smartest, most gory way possible for its launch in October.</p><section data-eng-breakout="5c9241086b7542a581f9e638bbc764d3" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/ab37afe0-f559-11eb-becf-3dde678801e8" alt="Back 4 Blood"></section><p>I actually chatted with Turtle Rock executive producer Matt O’Driscoll about the beta and what developers hope to get out of it.</p><p>&quot;These next two weeks are so vital to us,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#39;re gonna get so much data for how people play this. Is easy too easy? Is it too hard? Is nightmare mode impossible? Like, all these kind of little things. Or, how do people build decks?

According to the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/14440f81-d405-452f-97e2-a81458f5411f"><em><ins>Financial Times</ins></em></a>, the company has been briefing security researchers on the “neuralMatch” system, which would “continuously scan photos that are stored on a US user’s iPhone and have also been uploaded to its iCloud back-up system.”</p><p>The system would “proactively alert a team of human reviewers if it believes illegal imagery is detected” and human reviewers would alert law enforcement if the images were verified. The neuralMatch system, which was trained using a database from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, will be limited to iPhones in the United States to start, the report says.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The move would be somewhat of an about face for Apple, which has previously stood up to law enforcement to defend users’ privacy. The company famously clashed with the FBI in 2016 after it refused to unlock an iPhone belonging to the man behind the San Bernardino terror attack. CEO Tim Cook said at the time that the government’s request <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-02-18-fbi-apple-iphone-explainer.html"><ins>was “chilling”</ins></a> and would have far-reaching consequences that could effectively create a backdoor for more government  surveillance. (The FBI ultimately <a href="https://www.engadget.com/azimuth-apple-fbi-san-bernardino-iphone-unlock-141617737.html"><ins>turned</ins></a> to an outside security firm to unlock the phone.)</p><p>Now, security researchers are raising similar concerns. Though there’s broad support for increasing efforts to fight child abuse, researchers who spoke to the <em>FT </em>said that it could open the door for authoritarian regimes to spy on their citizens, since a system designed to detect one type of imagery could be expanded to other types of content, like terrorism or other content perceived as “anti-government.”</p><p>At the same time, Apple and other companies have faced mounting pressure to find ways to cooperate with law enforcement. As the report points out, social media platforms and cloud storage providers like iCloud already have systems to detect child sexual abuse imagery, but extending such efforts to images on a device would be a significant shift for the company.</p><p>Apple declined to comment to <em>FT,</em> but the company could release more details about its plans  “as soon as this week.”</p><p><strong>Update 8/5 4pm ET: </strong>Apple confirmed plans to <a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/">start testing</a> a system that would be able to detect images of child sexual abuse stored in iCloud Photos in the United States. &quot;Apple’s method of detecting known CSAM is designed with user privacy in mind. Instead of scanning images in the cloud, the system performs on-device matching using a database of known CSAM image hashes provided by NCMEC and other child safety organizations,&quot; the company wrote in a statement. &quot;Apple further transforms this database into an unreadable set of hashes that is securely stored on users’ devices.&quot;</p><p>The update will be rolling out at a later date, along with several other child safety features, including new parental controls that can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-child-safety-ios-15-193820644.html">detect explicit photos</a> in children&#39;s Messages.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-scan-iphones-child-abuse-neuralmatch-185009882.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c5deec0b-f18e-41e8-8c2e-fa433aa7ec36</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 05 Aug 2021 18:50:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628193716</ingested><modified>2021-08-05T20:02:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/dfb7b890-5be5-11eb-bcff-939f1a4f7370" width="3500" height="2297" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/dfb7b890-5be5-11eb-bcff-939f1a4f7370" width="3500" height="2297" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mike Segar / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Apple logo hangs inside the glass entrance to the Apple Store on 5th Avenue in New York City, April 4, 2013.

Meanwhile, additional reports of longstanding harassment and sexism at Activision Blizzard have continued to roll out, including photos and stories of the “Cosby Suite,” which was specifically named in the filing. According to the lawsuit, this was a hotel room where male employees would gather to harass women at company events, named after the rapist Bill Cosby.&nbsp;</p><p>Days after the filing, <a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-blizzard-developers-infamous-bill-cosby-suite-1847378762"><em>Kotaku </em>published photos</a> of the supposed Cosby Suite, showing male Activision Blizzard developers posing on a bed with a framed photo of Bill Cosby at BlizzCon 2013. Screenshots of conversations among the developers discussed gathering “hot chixx for the Coz” and other insulting, immature things (especially when you remember these are middle-aged men, not middle-schoolers).</p><p>One of the only executives actually named in the suit was Blizzard head J. Allen Brack, and it alleges he routinely ignored systemic harassment and failed to punish abusers. Brack called the allegations “extremely troubling,” but this line was thrown back in his face on Twitter when independent developer <a href="https://twitter.com/Nelsormensch/status/1418618755437924357">Nels Anderson</a> compared it to <a href="https://youtu.be/Fi5dQzZp3f0?t=264">a video</a> out of BlizzCon 2010, featuring Brack on the far left.&nbsp;</p><div id="e6cdfb096d3841a6839a7823f4ad5e4c"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fi5dQzZp3f0?rel=0&amp;start=264" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>In the video, a young woman asks the panel of <em>World of Warcraft</em> developers, all six of whom are white men, whether they&#39;ll ever create a female character that <em>doesn&#39;t </em>look like she just stepped out of a<em>&nbsp;</em>Victoria&#39;s Secret catalog. The panelists laugh and one responds, &quot;Which catalog would you like them to step out of?&quot; They proceed to essentially dismiss her question. At the end of the exchange, Brack piles on and makes a joke about one of the new characters coming from a sexy cow catalog.</p><p>On August 3rd, just two weeks after California filed its lawsuit, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blizzard-leader-j-allen-brack-steps-down-133538233.html?src=rss">Brack stepped down</a> from his role as the president of Blizzard. In his place will be GM Mike Ybarra and executive development VP Jen Oneal. Oneal will be the first woman in a president role since Activision’s founding in 1979; the lawsuit notes that there has never been a non-white president or CEO of Activision Blizzard.</p><p>Activision Blizzard’s initial response to the lawsuit was <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/activision-blizzard-executives-cant-decide-whether-allegations-of-abuse-are-disturbing-or-meritless/">tragic</a>, with one leader calling the allegations meritless and distorted. Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick, who regularly gets into fights with shareholders over the ridiculous fortune he’s amassed, published <a href="https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/letter-ceo-bobby-kotick-all-employees">his own response</a> to the lawsuit, where he essentially promised to listen better. Unsurprisingly, this didn’t alleviate many employees’ concerns. A petition in support of the lawsuit ended up gathering more than 2,000 employee signatures, and workers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/engadget-podcast-activision-blizzard-walkout-toxicity-123032466.html">organized a walk-out</a> just eight days after the filing, calling for systemic change at the studio.</p><div id="580ee883838541929e11d7aaef866f6b"><iframe src="//dk79lclgtez2i.cloudfront.net/gDdCyZz" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Shareholders weren&#39;t bolstered by Kotick&#39;s response, either. Investors filed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-investor-lawsuit-210106008.html">an additional class-action lawsuit</a> against Activision Blizzard on August 3rd, alleging the company failed to raise potential regulatory issues stemming from its discriminatory culture. Blizzard&#39;s head of HR, Jesse Meschuk, also left the company in the weeks following the initial lawsuit.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-07-29-ubisoft-staff-back-activision-blizzard-protestors-call-for-industry-wide-change">other</a> major <a href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-maker-weighs-in-on-activision-blizzard-allega-1847349156">game developers</a> have rallied behind the suit, and former Activision Blizzard leaders have <a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-co-creator-chris-metzen-on-blizzard-lawsuit-we-1847361133">shared their support</a> for employees, <a href="https://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1srp1ie">apologizing</a> for their parts in sustaining a toxic company culture.</p><div id="4981dff1c93c4fd09e7022e5442d8743"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is later than it should have been.

As evidenced by the photos, videos, stats and personal stories flowing out of Activision Blizzard, the company has operated on a bro-first basis for decades, and honestly, it’s been sustained by an industry that largely functions the same way.</p><p>In 2019, a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-30-gamergate-sexual-abuse-twitter-developers-zoe-quinn.html">wave of accusations</a> against prominent male developers crashed over the industry, and AAA studios like Ubisoft and Riot Games made headlines for fostering toxic workplace environments. California is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-22-california-challenges-riot-games-discrimination-settlement.html">currently suing Riot</a> over allegations of sexual harassment and gender discrimination in hiring and pay practices.</p><p>But even that’s not new. Women, non-binary people and marginalized folks in the video game industry have been speaking up about systemic harassment and discrimination for literal decades. Sexism is apparent in the hiring and pay habits of many major studios, and it’s also clear in the games themselves, which feature an overabundance of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-17-gender-video-games-e3-feminist-frequency-numbers.html">straight, white, male protagonists</a>.</p><p>What <em>is </em>surprising, this time around, is that the lawsuit against Activision Blizzard kind of came out of nowhere. It took a blockbuster media report to make California sue Riot in 2020, but the lawsuit against Activision Blizzard appeared on its own, after years of quiet investigation by the Department of Fair Employment and Housing. If sexism is systemic in the video game industry, it feels like the system is finally fighting back.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-discrimination-abuse-video-163056567.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7da88755-aa94-4059-818d-d5bae49cbff5</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 05 Aug 2021 16:30:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628181712</ingested><modified>2021-08-05T16:42:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f0ef7ae0-f54f-11eb-bf39-1896212cf0e2" width="5000" height="3263" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f0ef7ae0-f54f-11eb-bf39-1896212cf0e2" width="5000" height="3263" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[DAVID MCNEW via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Employees of the video game company, Activision Blizzard, hold a walkout and protest rally to denounce the companys response to a California Department of Fair Employment and Housing lawsuit and to call for changes in conditions for women and other marginalized groups, in , in Irvine, California, on July 28, 2021.  (Photo by DAVID MCNEW / AFP) (Photo by DAVID MCNEW/AFP via Getty Images)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[US-IT-GAMES-SEXISM-ACTIVISION]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Paramount+ will launch in Europe in 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbsclick=156VUfX8XxyLWbxyAT2WyRb6UkBRUkynXS9TWc0&amp;vndid=2055067&amp;clickid=2055067&amp;sharedid=&amp;ftag=PPM-09-10aag1f&amp;dclid=CjkKEQjwmK6IBhCI4fOn_rvo3bIBEiQACJT-gqeO4ooyS2GQLhrzBMAZ3cTxTUxCG7UZjd54WV_o1Ynw_wcB">Paramount+</a> is finally expanding into Europe — with a little help.

Netflix and Amazon Prime Video have rights to carry <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-discovery-211633637.html"><em>Star Trek: Discovery</em></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-picard-season-two-trailer-213316039.html"><em>Picard</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-august-12-213816677.html"><em>Lower Decks</em></a> in the UK, for instance.</p><p>Paramount+ is already available in the Americas, Australia, Hungary, Russia and the Middle East. This could be the most significant expansion to date, though. Europe is a major market for streaming, and Sky&#39;s influence in the region could put the service in front of people who wouldn&#39;t otherwise have considered it. This won&#39;t bring Paramount+ to the level of heavyweights like Netflix or Prime Video,  but it could help competition against narrowly focused rivals like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbo-max-expands-to-39-new-territories-082604619.html">HBO Max</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/paramount-plus-europe-launch-145633779.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">aac7f168-63ea-4255-9d03-d82b85c66663</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 05 Aug 2021 14:56:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628177326</ingested><modified>2021-08-05T15:29:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/34fd9a00-f5f5-11eb-aef7-e47775b1b342" width="3888" height="2592" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/34fd9a00-f5f5-11eb-aef7-e47775b1b342" width="3888" height="2592" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[UKRAINE - 2021/06/29: In this photo illustration, Paramount+ (Paramount Plus) logo is seen on a smartphone against its website in the background.

If you&#39;re on the lookout for an upgrade, it may be worth considering the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-wifi-router-canada-europe-availability-145751787.html"><ins>Google WiFi mesh system</ins></a>. A three-pack of nodes currently costs <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Wifi-System-Router-Replacement/dp/B08GG9CMLR?&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=productpost2021-20&amp;linkId=a28ac540f250a97d6669cd054110c7ca&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"><ins>$149</ins></a> on Amazon.

Google WiFi supports speeds of up to 1.2 Gbps, the company says. It claims a single point can support multiple simultaneous 4K video streams, though the size of your home, building materials and layout can impact signal strength.</p><p>The system uses WPA3 encryption and dual-band connectivity, as well as security updates and parental controls. You can manage the network using the Google Home app.</p><p>It&#39;s worth noting Google WiFi isn&#39;t quite as fast as the Nest WiFi system. Each node can cover up to 1,500 square feet, compared with 2,200 square feet for the Nest WiFi router and 1,600 square feet for each additional point. The latter also has a built-in Google Assistant smart speaker. A Nest WiFi three-pack costs <a href="https://store.google.com/us/config/nest_wifi?hl=en-US">$350</a>, though. If you&#39;re in the market for a solid mesh system that won&#39;t break the bank, Google WiFi might do the trick.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-wifi-mesh-system-deal-amazon-143831298.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">538a75a7-e157-4dbf-9566-a6469b575750</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 05 Aug 2021 14:38:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628174314</ingested><modified>2021-08-05T14:38:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c9536310-f5f5-11eb-bfb2-99dc60bb5966" width="708" height="491" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c9536310-f5f5-11eb-bfb2-99dc60bb5966" width="708" height="491" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google WiFi]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google WiFi]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[President Biden wants half of new vehicles to be zero-emissions by 2030]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>President Biden is throwing more of his weight <a href="https://www.engadget.com/f-150-lightning-ev-ford-biden-reveal-early-193001820.html">behind electric cars</a>.

It has a 6x digital zoom, 145-degree diagonal field of view and can see up to 10 feet away in the dark thanks to its night vision capabilities. It also has a 3:4 field of view so you can get a full head-to-toe look at whoever shows up at your door.</p><p>As for the Nest Cam, it can capture video in 1080p at up to 30 fps. The device has a 130-degree diagonal field of view, 6x digital zoom and night vision that can see objects up to 20 feet away. It has an IP54 rating for weather resistance too. As well as mounting it outside, you can set up the camera indoors.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/3df2edb0-f558-11eb-b9ff-8d889682a497" alt="Battery-powered Google Nest Cam" data-uuid="1fdbd755-b45f-3d4e-aae7-9dc80a48ba1a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Both products, which are designed with recycled materials, offer up to three hours of event video history. You can increase that with a Nest Aware subscription. Like some other Nest cameras, the battery-powered Nest Cam offers around-the-clock video recording with a Nest Aware Plus subscription, though you&#39;ll need to hook it up to a continuous power source.</p><p>In addition, the company is offering a Nest Cam with an integrated floodlight for the first time. One thing that all four devices have in common is that they&#39;re designed to only alert you to important events. They all have on-device machine learning capabilities to recognize and alert you to people, animals and vehicles. The Doorbell can detect and recognize packages placed as close as eight inches to your door. Google says don&#39;t need a subscription to use these features and that it trained the machine learning model on 40 million images to account for a variety of environments and lighting conditions.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/504cf500-f558-11eb-9fbe-81e0b5583eaa" alt="Google Nest Cam with floodlight" data-uuid="c85b35eb-49dc-3bab-8ef6-3de3c03031f9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>The devices also offer a familiar-face detection feature for Nest Aware subscribers. You can decide who they&#39;re able to recognize.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, the on-device processing capabilities allow the Doorbell and cameras to store up to an hour of video events locally if the power or Wi-Fi go out. That&#39;s approximately a week&#39;s worth of events depending on activity levels around your home. When everything&#39;s up and running again, they&#39;ll upload those events to the cloud.&nbsp;</p><p>As you’d expect, the cameras and Doorbell are work with the Google Home app and other Google products, such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/nest">Nest</a> displays. Google also says Nest camera data is encrypted.</p><p>The battery-powered Nest Cam and Doorbell (which each cost $180) are available to pre-order today in 18 countries, including the US, Canada, UK, Australia and New Zealand. They&#39;ll be available in those countries on August 24th, in Japan two days later and in Mexico later this year. The Nest Cam with floodlight ($280) and second-gen wired Nest Cam ($100) are coming soon.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-doorbell-camera-battery-powered-floodlight-130016075.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2b65b55c-fbc3-4fe8-aa21-a04533b33dab</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 05 Aug 2021 13:00:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628140776</ingested><modified>2021-08-05T05:19:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/0df09590-f558-11eb-bebf-96205eeb3be3" width="4943" height="3184" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/0df09590-f558-11eb-bebf-96205eeb3be3" width="4943" height="3184" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Battery-powered Google Nest Cam and Doorbell]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Battery-powered Google Nest Cam and Doorbell]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Elon Musk confirms Walter Isaacson is writing his biography]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Walter Isaacson, the author behind the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-06-06-official-steve-jobs-biography-now-available-for-pre-order-on-ama.html">2011 Steve Jobs biography</a> published shortly after his death, is currently writing Elon Musk&#39;s life story. <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/walter-isaacson-in-preliminary-talks-with-elon-musk-to-write-biography"><em>Fox Business</em></a> reported back in June that the famous writer was in talks with Musk about the possibility of writing a book on him.

In a statement, the Amazon says that it is launching two programs for businesses that use the retail giant’s infrastructure.

Amazon added that sellers can set the price based on the grades Amazon hands out, and can control much of the process themselves. FBA Liquidations, meanwhile, lets sellers ship returned or overstocked product to wholesalers straight from Amazon’s logistics depots. They can connect with Amazon’s bulk resale partners and try to, in the words of the company&#39;s corporate parlance, “recover a portion of their inventory cost.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The announcement comes shortly after the controversial report from <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/2021-06-21/amazon-destroying-millions-of-items-of-unsold-stock-in-one-of-its-uk-warehouses-every-year-itv-news-investigation-finds"><em>ITV News</em></a>, which claimed that truckloads of brand new products were marked for destruction.

As <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/566403-amazon-working-to-cut-waste-after-report-found-unsold-stock-was-destroyed"><em>The Hill</em></a> explained, the consequences of that report have raised hackles in the UK, with Labour MPs <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/559804-british-lawmakers-demand-meeting-with-amazon-after-video-shows-products">demanding</a> an explanation for the evidence presented. At the time, Amazon said that “no items are sent to landfill,” but as a last resort, some are sent to “energy recovery.”</p><p>Libby Johnson McKee, director of Amazon Returns, ReCommerce and Sustainability, said that the new initiatives are one example of how Amazon is trying to &quot;ensure that products sold on Amazon […] go to good use and don&#39;t become waste.” McKee added that the policies will help reduce costs and help companies who use Amazon&#39;s fulfillment platform will be able to grow their businesses. FBA Grade and Resell is available in the UK now, with other European nations coming online across next year. FBA Liquidations, meanwhile, is available in the US and other European nations, but is coming to the UK in August.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fba-grading-returns-wholesale-policy-changes-114014902.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4c73fef0-131c-43aa-a391-de4bc5b6831d</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 05 Aug 2021 11:40:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628162064</ingested><modified>2021-08-05T11:14:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/3272cf40-f5db-11eb-aef8-9bef40a4fe11" width="4928" height="3280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/3272cf40-f5db-11eb-aef8-9bef40a4fe11" width="4928" height="3280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Stirk via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LEEDS, ENGLAND - MAY 27: A general view outside an Amazon UK Services Ltd Warehouse at Leeds Distribution Park on May 27, 2021 in Leeds, England.

This is the “problem” that Nintendo is currently dealing with as it publishes its most recent <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2021/210805e.pdf">quarterly report</a>, reflecting the fact that the world has changed once again. In the three months to June 30th, the company posted an operating profit of 119 billion yen, which works out to roughly $1.1 billion. That is, however, a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-hardware-software-sales-double-year-over-year-075033312.html">17.3 percent drop compared to the 144 billion yen</a> ($1.3 billion) posted this time last year, when people were mandated to spend much more time indoors.</p><p>The other difference compared to last year is a lack of a brand-name Nintendo title to draw in users like it had in 2020. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-16-animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-switch.html"><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em></a> was (according to some analysts) the third-biggest selling game of the year, which also drove sales of new Switch consoles to buyers looking to get in on the action. In fact, <em>New Horizons</em> is still a big selling title, with 1.26 million units sold in this quarter, a year after it was originally launched. And Nintendo’s software sales in total were only 10.2 percent smaller than the trade it did across the same period last year.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Rather amusingly, Nintendo broke out a graph in its <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2021/210805_3e.pdf">financial report</a> showing that, if you remove the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/animal-crossing-video-game-sales-diablo-ii-virtual-economies-131547613.html"><em>Animal Crossing</em></a> spike, its software sales have constantly increased since at least 2018. The fact that investors are still apparently nervous about Nintendo’s future — to the point where <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-05/nintendo-buying-back-shares-after-profit-misses-estimates?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> is reporting that the company will issue stock buybacks to cover the gap in fallen sales — shows the disconnect between Wall Street and the world the rest of us are living in. But the company hasn’t altered its sales forecast or plans for the rest of the year, such is its confidence about its business.</p><p>Nintendo’s financial health is going to look a lot rosier in the back half of 2021 anyway, with a number of big titles out, and soon to be released. The HD remake of <em>Zelda: Skyward Sword</em> isn’t covered in this report, and <em>WarioWare: Get It Together</em> drops in September. October sees the launch of <em>Metroid Dread</em> and <em>Mario Party Superstars</em>, while November sees the launch of <em>Pokémon Brilliant Diamond</em> and <em>Shining Pearl</em>. Plus, you know, there’s the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-nintendo-switch-oled-131324519.html">OLED Switch</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zelda-game-watch-cute-release-date-2021-170211386.html">Zelda Game and Watch</a> coming to boost hardware sales.</p><p>Not to mention that next year is likely to feature a third <a href="https://www.engadget.com/splatoon-3-nintendo-switch-announcement-2022-232415600.html"><em>Splatoon</em></a> game, a sequel to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-164912773.html"><em>Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and a new entry in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope-nintendo-switch-ubisoft-2022-201632962.html"><em>Mario+Rabbids</em></a> series. And what investors are forgetting, it seems, is that if we’re all asked to start traveling to work again, it’s more likely that we’ll be tempted to bring along those Switch consoles some folks panic-bought at the start of last year. Which will require a steady stream of new games to keep their fingers entertained while sat on the bus or subway.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-2021-q1-financial-post-animal-crossing-slump-100125720.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3d61e0e5-4341-4315-8acf-5fb255dee938</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 05 Aug 2021 10:01:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628157687</ingested><modified>2021-08-05T10:01:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f8998500-f5d2-11eb-acf7-5fcf7979aacc" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f8998500-f5d2-11eb-acf7-5fcf7979aacc" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Zhang Peng via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[TIANJIN, CHINA - 2021/07/20: A cartoon figurine of Super Mario Bros. stands in front of a Nintendo Switch store in a shopping market.
