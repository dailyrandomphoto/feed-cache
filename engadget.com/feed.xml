Both the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Galaxy Watch 4" href="https://amzn.to/3G4yZoy">Galaxy Watch 4</a> and the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Watch 4 Classic" href="https://amzn.to/3DRXhA4">Watch 4 Classic</a> are on sale for $220 and $300, respectively, as part of Samsung&#39;s multi-day sale event on Amazon. These are record-low prices for both smartwatches, making now a good time to pick one up if you have an Android user on your gift list this year.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3G4yZoy" id="6bf32c8de17548d3b8673045af91f453" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Galaxy Watch 4 at Amazon - $220</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3DRXhA4" id="55da996227664adcb91862ffea74120c" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Galaxy Watch 4 Classic at Amazon - $300</a><p>Galaxy Watches have been, for quite some time, the best smartwatches to get if you&#39;re an Android user. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-body-fat-scan-wear-os-120026149.html">Galaxy Watch 4 series</a> keeps this pattern going and they are the first devices to use the new Wear OS and One UI developed by Samsung and Google&#39;s new partnership. Tizen faithfuls will know their way around the UI — thankfully, the team decided to follow Samsung&#39;s lead in this case, adding only useful features into the mix like the ability to download Play Store apps directly to your wrist. You&#39;re also able to use gesture controls to do things like answer a call with a flick of your wrist.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Galaxy Watch 4 models are also solid fitness trackers. Inside is a new three-in-one biometric sensor that&#39;s faster and gives more accurate readings than those in previous models. It also helps enable things like bioelectrical impedance analysis for body mass scans. The Galaxy Watch 4 can also take blood oxygen readings, track sleep, detect if you&#39;re snoring at night and track 95 different workouts. If you&#39;re already an active person or are looking to get more active, chances are you&#39;ll be able to monitor all of your favorite exercises and more with this wearable.</p><p>On top of all that, the Galaxy Watch 4 models look pretty nice, too. The Watch 4 Classic has a physical rotating bezel and a stainless steel case, but otherwise it&#39;s the same as the standard Watch 4. Their screens are crisp and bright, and they&#39;re generally comfortable to wear all day long. General performance is good as well, although battery life could be better at just about one day. If you have an Android user — or a Samsung fan — in your life, the Galaxy Watch 4 would make a good gift this holiday season.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-drops-to-new-low-of-220-at-amazon-131549119.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">42b5cf58-ba1d-439c-bf24-9a3ebbe8e5b9</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 13:15:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634648821</ingested><modified>2021-10-19T13:07:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4bc24470-0509-11ec-94e9-ed0b3ea276d8" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4bc24470-0509-11ec-94e9-ed0b3ea276d8" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A black Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 on a wrist]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 ]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[iMovie for macOS Monterey can edit iPhone 13 Cinematic Mode videos]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You don&#39;t need <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-final-cut-pro-logic-pro-m1-pro-max-update-183550958.html">pro editing software</a> to work with an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html">iPhone 13&#39;s</a> Cinematic Mode video on your Mac. <em>AppleInsider</em><a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/10/19/apple-updates-imovie-for-mac-with-cinematic-mode-support-more">notes</a> Apple has <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/imovie/id408981434">updated</a> iMovie for Mac to enable editing for Cinematic Mode footage. You can change the focus subject, tweak the depth of field effect and even delete focal points on a much larger screen.</p><p>There&#39;s one main catch: you&#39;ll need <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-os-monterey-preview-public-beta-175927010.html">macOS Monterey</a> for this to work. Given that Monterey won&#39;t officially debut <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macos-monterey-release-date-180751313.html">until October 25th</a>, you&#39;ll likely be waiting about a week before you can give Cinematic Mode editing a try.

It&#39;s safe to presume most iPhone 13 owners will still edit on-device, even if they have a Mac. These files can take a long time to transfer, after ll. However, this should still be useful if you want to eke more from Cinematic Mode without learning your way around Final Cut Pro.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/imovie-mac-iphone-13-cinematic-mode-131155635.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c413aaa2-32f2-491f-994e-62cf439a615a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 13:11:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634648534</ingested><modified>2021-10-19T13:02:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/3e761270-30d7-11ec-b9ff-df8aab9a4326" width="1920" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/3e761270-30d7-11ec-b9ff-df8aab9a4326" width="1920" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iMovie for Mac editing Cinematic Mode video from iPhone 13]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iMovie for Mac editing Cinematic Mode video from iPhone 13]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Artiphon's quirky Orba now lets you create musical 'selfies']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When Artiphon launched its $99 Orba musical instrument, we <a href="https://www.engadget.com/artiphon-orba-review-music-fidget-toy-mpe-midi-synthesizer-looper-130020266.html">found it to be</a> an &quot;idiotproof&quot; device that lets creative in your spare time, while offering more depth for those willing to explore.

The <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-build-hat-lego-education/">Build HAT</a> (or Hardware Attached on Top), as it is called, is an add-on device that plugs into the Pi&#39;s 40-pin GPIO header. It was specifically designed to make it easy to use Pi hardware to control up to four LEGO Technic motors and sensors from the the toy company&#39;s Education Spike kits. Those sets are meant as a STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, the Arts and Mathematics) learning tool for young students. The HAT also works with motors and sensors from the Mindstorms Robot Inventor kit.</p><p>In addition to the Build HAT itself, the company has created a <a href="https://buildhat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Python library</a> that can help students build prototypes using a Raspberry Pi and LEGO components. Plus, Raspberry Pi designed a $15 power supply for the HAT that can also power the motors and sensors attached to it. The Build HAT will set buyers back $25 each, and it works with all 40-pin GPIO Raspberry Pi boards, including the Raspberry Pi 4 and Raspberry Pi Zero.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Those who want to make sure that their LEGO components will work with the HAT can also check out Raspberry Pi&#39;s handy <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/accessories/build-hat.html#device-compatibility">list of compatible components</a>. Finally, those who need a bit of help to get started can try follow one of Pi&#39;s project guides, which include a <a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/lego-game-controller">DIY game controller</a>, a <a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/lego-robot-car">robot buggy</a> that can be controlled via Bluetooth and a <a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/lego-robot-face">robotic face</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/raspberry-pi-build-hat-lego-robots-123039227.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7d073afd-12c8-41d2-b948-7d6acf7275d1</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 12:30:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634645400</ingested><modified>2021-10-19T12:10:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/968edf10-30cc-11ec-9fd0-de59a72aacc0" width="1536" height="996" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/968edf10-30cc-11ec-9fd0-de59a72aacc0" width="1536" height="996" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Raspberry Pi]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Raspberry Pi]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Raspberry Pi]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The top tech deals in Best Buy's early Black Friday sale]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Given all the talk of supply chain issues this year, it&#39;s no surprise that we&#39;re starting to see early Black Friday sales hit the internet before November 1.

It should be less clunky than the current system of direct sharing from the console.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On top of screenshots taken from the Create Menu or Create button shortcuts, you can share gameplay videos under three minutes in length up to 1080p (not 4K). For screenshots and videos to be auto-uploaded, make sure you&#39;ve linked your PS5 console to the PlayStation app. It also needs to be left in rest mode and have the &quot;Stay Connected to the Internet&quot; setting enabled.

As expected, its high-end laptops were the star of its Unleashed event yesterday and are the first machines powered by Apple’s new M1 Pro and M1 Max chips. (The company is borrowing iPhone nomenclature, it seems.)</p><p>It’s been hard for me to get too excited about the MacBook Pro’s slow, cautious evolution over the last few years. The OLED Touch Bar was a misstep, nixing function keys for a light-up bar with customizable touch panels. There were fewer ports than older models, including the SD card slot. This added another dongle to my bag, alongside a USB-C converter for any devices that hadn’t caught up with the MacBook’s own USB-C ports — which were few and far between. And don’t get me started on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-23-apple-macbook-keyboard-next-day-repairs-in-store.html"><ins>&quot;butterfly&quot; style keyboard </ins></a>that appeared in 2015.</p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-pro-2021-update-price-specs-release-date-173447695.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ca2dc640-30c9-11ec-bf7d-59022bb1283a" style="height:422;width:675;" alt="The Morning After" data-uuid="423853ea-64c6-3d13-a4ba-69f42a2f5d6f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure></a><p>The 2021 MacBook Pro literally brushes away most of my problems. Yes, there’s an SD card reader, more ports, no more Touch Bar to accidentally hit and close internet tabs, more ports and a blast from the past.</p><p>Yep, MagSafe is back. While the term returned on recent iPhones, it’s been years since Apple offered the magnetic cable safety feature on its computers. It’s different from the old connector, and, in worst case scenarios, you can still charge through USB-C.</p><p>The screens have been expanded, featuring micro-LED display tech first used on iPad Pro and also marking the first appearance of a notch on MacBooks. Long live the notch!</p><p>These machines are for power users — and Apple is seriously talking up the capabilities of its new chips, more on that below. But that’s not what intrigues me. It’s the fact that Apple is walking back some of its pretty major missteps in recent MacBook Pro history and making it more usable in the process, tempting me to buy myself a new MacBook for the first time in a decade.</p><p>The 14-inch base model and 16-inch base model are set to start at $1,999 and $2,499 respectively. You can pre-order both today, with machines arriving on October 26th. Expect our reviews of both the 14- and 16-inch <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-pro-2021-update-price-specs-release-date-173447695.html">MacBook Pros </a>very soon — I should start saving.</p><p>— Mat Smith</p><p></p><h3>All the big Apple news you might have missed&nbsp;</h3><h3></h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-voice-plan-171329499.html"><ins>Apple Music&#39;s new $5 plan only works with Siri</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-homepod-mini-new-colors-171521559.html"><ins>Apple HomePod mini: new colors for 2021</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-final-cut-pro-logic-pro-m1-pro-max-update-183550958.html"><ins>Apple updates Final Cut and Logic to take advantage of new M1 Pro and Max chips</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-mac-event-2021-highlights-194601228.html"><ins>Here&#39;s everything Apple announced at its fall Mac event</ins></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-m1-pro-m1-max-chips-macbook-pro-172415918.html">The M1 Pro and M1 Max are Apple&#39;s high-end Mac chips</a></h2><h3>Finally, pro chips for the MacBook Pro.</h3><h3></h3><p>It&#39;s been almost a year since Apple unveiled its first custom chip for Macs, the ARM-based M1. As we saw in our review of the latest MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and colorful iMac, the M1 was a marvel, if not quite the pro-level of power many might have been expecting.</p><p>With the M1 Pro and M1 Max, the two chips underpinning the company&#39;s new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros, it’s making a renewed pitch for power users. Both chips have 5nm 10-core processors, with eight high-performance cores and two high-efficiency units. Apple says the chips offer up to 1.7X faster performance than competing eight-core PC chips, which makes them particularly compelling for people doing heavy-duty 3D and video rendering.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-m1-pro-m1-max-chips-macbook-pro-172415918.html"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-marvel-cinematic-universe-indiana-jones-delay-disney-plus-190758945.html">Disney delays all of Marvel’s 2022 films</a></h2><h2>At least three major movies will all hit Disney+ later as a result.</h2><h3></h3><p>Disney has shaken up its movie release calendar, with several Marvel Cinematic Universe flicks delayed.

The toy company has made a special edition the iconic Chatter telephone for its 60th anniversary — one that&#39;s fully functional and can make <em>and</em> receive calls. Before you start planning on where to display it at your home, know that it doesn&#39;t work as a landline unit.

Dubbed <a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/verified"><ins>Deck Verified</ins></a>, the system groups games into four categories: “Verified,” “Playable,” “Unsupported” and “Unkown.”</p><p>If you see a game with the first badge, it means it will work great out of the box. Of the playable category, Valve says you may need to do some tweaking. For example, in a title like <em>Team Fortress 2</em>, you might have to download a community controller configuration before you can use the Steam Deck’s thumbsticks and face buttons to play the game. Valve lists <em>Half-Life: Alyx </em>as an example of an experience that you won’t be able to play on Steam Deck, suggesting the unsupported category will be mostly occupied by VR titles. Lastly, an unknown tag means the company hasn’t had a chance to test that game for compatibility yet.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d9479620-305a-11ec-b716-14107f830dc1" style="height:1359;width:2176;" alt="Deck Verified" data-uuid="335af147-8f73-3ec0-a3e9-f3569b800438"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valve</div></figure><p>To earn verified status, a game must meet four criteria. First, it should include full controller support, and the onscreen keyboard should appear when needed. Second, you shouldn’t see any compatibility warnings. The game should also support the Steam Deck’s native 1,280 by 800 resolution, and text should be easily readable. Lastly, if the title is playable through Proton, everything, including any anti-cheat software, should work through the compatibility layer.</p><p>To make things easy, you’ll see the badges appear both in your Steam library and the store. Moreover, each time you go to buy a game, you’ll see a full compatibility report that lists any issues to expect when playing it. Valve says it’s also working on a system that will allow you to see what compatibility category each game in your library falls under before Steam Deck is available in December.&nbsp;</p><p>If nothing else, the system should make it easier to decide if it makes sense to buy a Steam Deck. The last thing anyone wants is to spend $400 on a new gadget and not be able to play their favorite games.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/valve-steam-deck-verified-compatibility-system-223810108.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3796e2fe-32a0-4147-930b-39fc511a2179</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 22:38:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634593925</ingested><modified>2021-10-18T21:52:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/c3657980-305a-11ec-afff-77eb41597111" width="2174" height="1358" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/c3657980-305a-11ec-afff-77eb41597111" width="2174" height="1358" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Valve]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Valve Deck Verified]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Valve Deck Verified]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[EPA announces plans to regulate cancer-causing 'forever chemicals']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Showing up in everything from <a href="https://news.nd.edu/news/use-of-pfas-in-cosmetics-widespread-new-study-finds/">cosmetics</a> and dental floss to product packaging and cleaning supplies. <a href="https://www.epa.gov/pfas/pfas-explained">polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl substances</a>, or PFAS, are ubiquitous to the modern world.

There are concrete steps that we are taking that move this issue forward in a very aggressive way.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The EPA unveiled its 3-year roadmap towards regulating the class of chemicals on Monday centers on a trio of approaches: &quot;increase investments in research, leverage authorities to take action now to restrict PFAS chemicals from being released into the environment, and accelerate the cleanup of PFAS contamination,&quot; according to <a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-administrator-regan-announces-comprehensive-national-strategy-confront-pfas">the EPA</a>. To that end, the administration plans to set enforceable drinking water limits under the Safe Drinking Water Act, designate PFAS as a hazardous substance under CERCLA (which would hold manufacturers financially liable for incinerating the chemical or releasing it into waterways), set timelines for establishing effluent guideline limitations under the Clean Water Act, review rules and guidance under the Toxic Substances Control Act, and expand monitoring, data collection and research of the chemicals. Additionally, the agency announced a new national testing strategy that will require PFAS manufacturers to provide toxicity data on the chemicals they create.&nbsp;</p><div id="adb030b67d7f4f68a87e235e5086936a"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9W74aeuqsiU?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>“Communities contaminated by these toxic forever chemicals have waited decades for action,” Ken Cook, President of the Environmental Working Group, said in a press statement. “So, it’s good news that Administrator Regan will fulfill President Biden’s pledge to take quick action to reduce PFOA and PFOS in tap water, to restrict industrial releases of PFAS into the air and water, and to designate PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances to hold polluters accountable. It’s been more than 20 years since EPA and EWG first learned that these toxic forever chemicals were building up in our blood and increasing our likelihood of cancer and other health harms. It’s time for action, not more plans, and that’s what this Administrator will deliver.&quot;</p><p>A handful of states including New Jersey, Vermont, Michigan, and New York, have already moved to regulate the chemicals on their own — California banned their use in baby and toddler products earlier this year — while the EU has banned many of the chemicals outright. The <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/can-epa-get-rid-toxic-forever-chemicals-n1281707">US Navy has announced</a> that it will ban PFAS from its firefighting foam by October, 2023, as directed by Congress.</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/epa-announces-plans-to-regulate-cancer-causing-forever-chemicals-212350443.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b606c7d2-b599-4952-bf51-0073fc33848b</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 21:23:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634590986</ingested><modified>2021-10-18T21:03:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/310da020-3056-11ec-b7bc-67f25cff4613" width="6360" height="4240" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/310da020-3056-11ec-b7bc-67f25cff4613" width="6360" height="4240" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Drew Angerer via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, DC - MAY 12: Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Michael Regan speaks during the daily press briefing at the White House on May 12, 2021 in Washington, DC.

After the by-the-numbers affair that was the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-event-supercut-201538409.html"><ins>iPhone 13 event</ins></a>, Monday’s presentation was a more exciting thing to watch, thanks in large part to the first significant refresh to the MacBook Pro in five years. Here’s everything the company announced at the event.</p><h2>MacBook Pro</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/97969f70-303a-11ec-9fff-50d91433effd" style="height:1300;width:2000;" alt="Macbook Pro 2021 redesign" data-uuid="d993983f-b5e7-3916-b2d2-6bcd4d785116"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><h2></h2><p>Unsurprisingly, the redesigned MacBook Pros were the star of the show, and there’s a lot to unpack between the two new 14- and 16-inch models. As expected, both laptops represent a return to form for the MacBook Pro line. Apple has replaced the Touch Bar with a standard set of function keys, as well as added MagSafe, an SD card slot and an HDMI port. New to both computers are 120Hz ProMotion displays. The 14-inch model will run its screen at 3,024 x 1,964, while the 16-inch variant has a 3,456 x 2,234 panel. Each also has an iPhone-style camera notch that is likely to be divisive.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Additionally, you can configure both models with Apple’s new, more powerful M1 Pro and Max chips (more on them in a moment). All those new features come at a cost, with the 14-inch base model and 16-inch base model set to start at $1,999 and $2,499 respectively. You can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-pre-order-apple-airpods-third-generation-macbook-pro-14-inch-16-inch-m1-pro-m1-max-182308261.html"><ins>pre-order</ins></a> both computers today, with general availability to follow on October 26th. In the meantime, macOS Monterey will land the day before on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macos-monterey-release-date-180751313.html"><ins>October 25th</ins></a>.</p><h2>M1 Pro and M1 Max</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9d6db100-303e-11ec-abf7-2f2e15bed89c" style="height:1300;width:2000;" alt="Apple M1 Pro and M1 Max chip" data-uuid="1328c132-0b4e-3f19-bec9-aaad1bf72bac"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><h2></h2><p>At the heart of the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros are Apple’s new M1 Pro and M1 Max chips. Both feature 5nm 10-core processors made up of eight high-performance cores and two high-efficiency units. Where they differ from one another is in terms of potential video and memory performance. The M1 Pro comes with up to 16 GPU cores and can support up to 32GB of RAM with 200 GB/s of bandwidth. The M1 Max, meanwhile, tops out at 32 graphics cores and double the RAM and memory bandwidth. In practice, Apple claims the chips are 70 percent faster than its previous M1 SoC and offer up to 1.7 times faster performance than competing CPUs from Intel and AMD. They should also make short work of the company’s updated <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-final-cut-pro-logic-pro-m1-pro-max-update-183550958.html"><ins>Final Cut and Logic suites</ins></a>.</p><h2>AirPods</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a063b920-3036-11ec-b7d7-7c35df5aba66" style="height:1300;width:2000;" alt="Airpods" data-uuid="fc33df11-85c2-36bb-bbff-777d0bd788eb"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>Going into Monday’s event, we were confident Apple would update its “basic” AirPods. But other than an AirPods Pro-like design, we weren’t expecting them to get many new features. So what we saw today was a surprise. While you won’t find ANC on the updated AirPods, they do include support for Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking and Adaptive EQ. The latter allows the AirPods to adjust the low and mid-range frequencies of audio in real-time. Other notable specs include IPX4 sweat and water resistance and up to 30 hours total of battery life with help from the included charging case.</p><p>You can pre-order the new AirPods starting today for $179. They’ll begin shipping on October 26th. For those who want to save some money, Apple has discounted the second-generation AirPods to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-second-gen-discount-173918293.html"><ins>$129</ins></a>.</p><h2>Apple Music Voice Plan</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0df6fb60-3036-11ec-afd7-07a954a8ac88" style="height:1300;width:2000;" alt="Apple HomePod Mini" data-uuid="e9285fd7-982a-3b8c-a479-8500ca331028"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>Alongside the third-generation AirPods, the company announced a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-voice-plan-171329499.html"><ins>discounted Apple Music</ins></a> plan. It will only set you back $5 per month but the catch is you can only control the service through Siri. Apple pitched the plan as the ideal complement for the HomePod mini. Speaking of Apple’s diminutive smart speaker, it will be available in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-homepod-mini-new-colors-171521559.html"><ins>three additional colors</ins></a> — yellow, orange and blue — starting in November.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Apple’s Mac event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/mac%20event%202021"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-mac-event-2021-highlights-194601228.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a6e37f20-30fa-483e-b6f9-e018a4deed4e</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 19:46:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634586364</ingested><modified>2021-10-18T19:46:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/1a161250-304a-11ec-b45b-58ad2b13e5bc" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/1a161250-304a-11ec-b45b-58ad2b13e5bc" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[MacBook Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[MacBook Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Unannounced Beats Fit Pro earbuds leak in iOS 15.1]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Aside from a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-third-gen-announced-price-specs-availability-171540519.html">new pair of AirPods</a>, Apple will also apparently launch a pair of Beats Fit Pro earbuds soon.

On the flip side, Disney brought one mystery Marvel movie (hopefully <em>Guardians of the Galaxy 3</em>) forward by a week from November 10th, 2023.</p><p>Elsewhere, the next Indiana Jones movie has been delayed by 11 months. You&#39;ll need to wait until June 30th, 2023 for Harrison Ford&#39;s fifth stint as the iconic archeologist. Ford sustained an injury while filming this summer, though he&#39;s now back in action. A live-action Disney movie, a 20th Century film and two Marvel flicks (all untitled) have been removed from the 2023 schedule.&nbsp;</p><p>Remarkably, given how many times the film has been delayed over the years, Disney hasn&#39;t shifted Avatar 2&#39;s release date.

The company has <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/final-cut-pro-and-logic-pro-updated-on-the-new-macbook-pro-with-m1-pro-m1-max/">released</a> new versions of Final Cut Pro (10.6) and Logic Pro (10.7) that make the most of the M1 Pro and M1 Max, particularly in video processing and machine learning. FCP editors can play up to seven streams of 8K ProRes at once, and export in the format over five times faster — no mean feat for a laptop, as Apple was keen to point out. You can even color-grade 8K HDR footage using only the MacBook Pro&#39;s built-in screen.</p><p>There&#39;s also a new Object Tracker you can use to link animated effects to faces and objects. You can easily edit Cinematic Mode video from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-review-120-hz-promotion-screen-macro-camera-cinematic-mode-samples-battery-life-143041678.html">iPhone 13 series</a>, too. Motion now renders visual effects work up to two times faster, and can play two 8K video streams at five times the previous frame rate. Compressor, meanwhile, transcodes HEVC video up to twice as fast, and ProRes up to ten times as quickly. And if you live in Canon&#39;s world, you can transcode Cinema RAW Light videos to other formats for the first time. There&#39;s even a Watch Folders feature that will automatically encode content when it reaches a given folder — helpful for streamlining a workflow, particularly among teams.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Logic Pro update, meanwhile, is focused on spatial audio creation — just in time for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-third-gen-announced-price-specs-availability-171540519.html">new AirPods</a>, of course. New mixers, panners and plugins let you author Dolby Atmos tracks, and the new MacBook Pros can use their added performance to create particularly advanced mixes. The music editing tool now comes bundled with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/garageband-dua-lipa-lady-gaga-remix-mark-ronson-172019456.html">Producer Packs</a> you saw in GarageBand, too, so you can integrate royalty-free beats and samples from the likes of Boys Noize, Mark Ronson and Trakgirl.</p><p>Both updates are free for existing users. Final Cut Pro normally costs $300 for new users, with Motion and Compressor costing $50 each. Logic Pro is priced at $200. The upgrades make the most sense if you&#39;re deeply invested in ProRes or intend to publish on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-voice-plan-171329499.html">Apple Music</a>. Still, it&#39;s easy to see the appeal, at least for FCP. You could quickly turn around certain video projects using only your MacBook Pro, even if you&#39;re working primarily with 8K footage.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Apple’s Mac event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/mac%20event%202021"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-final-cut-pro-logic-pro-m1-pro-max-update-183550958.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cee5f04d-d7a0-4b32-b2eb-ba67b0b71615</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 18:35:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634582153</ingested><modified>2021-10-18T18:35:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fe2eeff0-303d-11ec-9ab7-c35e7aaad8af" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fe2eeff0-303d-11ec-9ab7-c35e7aaad8af" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro optimized for MacBook Pro with M1 Pro and M1 Max]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro optimized for MacBook Pro with M1 Pro and M1 Max]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to pre-order Apple’s new AirPods and MacBook Pros]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-what-to-expect-october-18-unleashed-142518973.html">&quot;Unleashed&quot; event</a> today focused on music and the Mac, with the company revealing updated products in each category. We finally got word of the next-generation AirPods, which have a new design and support for spatial audio plus MagSage wireless charging. The company also unveiled new colors for its HomePod mini smart speaker and two new MacBook Pros for the power users among us. The laptops run on the company&#39;s new M1 Pro and M1 Max chipsets and sport revamped designs with webcam notches, Liquid Retina XDR displays and extra ports (HDMI and an SD slot!).

Inside the buds is a new low-distortion driver that produces powerful bass along with crisp highs. These buds have a few features previously only available on AirPods Pro and AirPods Max, including spatial audio and Adaptive EQ, the latter of which automatically adjusts frequencies in real time based on what you&#39;re listening to.</p><p>The new AirPods have a sweat and water-resistant design and Apple improved the battery life, too. These should last up to six hours on a  charge, and you&#39;ll get an hour of listening time after only five minutes of charging. The case is now MagSafe and wireless-charging capable and it holds four additional full charges, so you can enjoy around 30 hours of total listening time.</p><p>Apple is keeping the second-generation AirPods around, which will be good for anyone who doesn&#39;t want to shell out $179 for the new ones.

The laptop ushers in several significant design changes, including a new keyboard that&#39;s supposed to be more similar to the company&#39;s Magic Keyboard for iMac. Also, the TouchBar is gone; it&#39;s been replaced with physical Function keys, something that TouchBar skeptics will likely cheer.</p><p>These MacBook Pros are thicker than previous models because they actually have a healthy variety of ports. Both have a total of three Thunderbolt 4 ports along with an HDMI socket, an SD card slot, a headphone jack and a MagSafe connector for charging (although you can power up via the Thunderbolt ports as well). This will be a welcome change for power users who have been living the dongle life for years with previous-gen MacBook Pros.</p><p>Additionally, the new laptops have Liquid Retina XDR displays that reach almost to the end of the machines&#39; lids, interrupted by a notch that holds the 1080p webcam. The 14-inch model has a 14.2-inch 3,024 x 1,964 resolution screen, to be precise, while the 16-inch model has a 16.2-inch 3,456 x 2,234 panel. Both support ProMotion with refresh rates up to 120Hz. Apple is promising up to 17 hours of video playback on the 14-inch model and up to 21 hours of video playback on the larger version. As for other specs, you can customize the laptops with up to 32GB of RAM and up to a whopping 8TB of storage.</p><h2>HomePod mini</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4406ba80-303e-11ec-96fd-8d8cd58ac9eb" alt="Apple HomePod mini" data-uuid="310f5d01-95fe-31cd-8749-72ce460754c5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>Lastly, Apple announced new colors of the HomePod mini: yellow, orange and blue.

For comparison, the second-generation model is currently <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$119 on Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/3n8Ts2L">$119 on Amazon</a>, or <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$160 with wireless charging case" href="https://amzn.to/30HFkpL">$160 with wireless charging case</a>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Follow all of the news from Apple’s Mac event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/mac%20event%202021"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><strong>Update 4:25PM ET:</strong> This post has been updated to reflect a change on Apple&#39;s product page for the discounted second-gen model concerning the wireless charging case.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-second-gen-discount-173918293.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">848215b5-51c9-470e-9d97-68353b8eb9b0</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 17:39:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634588984</ingested><modified>2021-10-18T20:29:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/c61ef730-3039-11ec-bbff-320c8c337f58" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/c61ef730-3039-11ec-bbff-320c8c337f58" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chris Velazco/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Airpods]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Airpods]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's latest MacBook Pros have MagSafe, SD card slots and camera notches]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s been five years since Apple released a totally redesigned version of the MacBook Pro, a laptop that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-11-14-macbook-pro-review-2016.html">opened the company up to years of criticism</a> for everything from its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-21-apple-fixes-macbook-pro-keyboard-9th-gen-six-core-eight-core-cpus.html">flawed keyboard design</a> and the Touch Bar to its lack of any ports besides USB-C. But, as expected, Apple is giving the MacBook Pro a complete do-over, and it sounds an improvement in several areas.</p><p>The laptops come in 14.2- and 16.2-inch models, with increased resolutions over the earlier models. The <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/14-inch">14-inch model</a> runs at 3,024 x 1,964 resolution, while the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/16-inch">16-inch models</a> has 3,456 x 2,234 resolution. ProMotion high refresh rate is on board, too, with up to a 120Hz option. But, the laptops also have a camera notch, just like the iPhone, something that was rumored in the lead-up to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-what-to-expect-october-18-unleashed-142518973.html">today&#39;s &quot;Unleashed&quot; press event</a>. The notch is about the size of the menu bar, so while it&#39;s a bit strange it still offers way more screen real estate than before. And, both laptops are using mini LED technology, similar to what’s in the current 12.9-inch iPad Pro.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Naturally, Apple’s latest laptops are using the company’s own custom silicon. This time, it’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-m1-pro-m1-max-chips-macbook-pro-172415918.html">the M1 Pro</a>. As the rumors predicted, it’s a 5-nanometer, 10-core chip with eight high-performance cores and two efficiency cores. It&#39;s 70 percent faster than the M1, and has one 16 graphics cores. Apple also announced an M1 Max, which has twice the memory bandwidth as the M1 Pro (400GB/s), and it also has 32 graphics cores. The M1 Max also supports up to 64GB memory, a huge improvement over the 16GB of memory that was supported by the M1.</p><p>As for ports, those of us out there who miss the plentiful options on older MacBooks should be pretty happy here. The new MacBook Pro unsurprisingly features three USB-C / Thunderbolt ports, but it also brings back an HDMI socket and SD card slot, two features fans have long been demanding be re-added. There aren’t any USB-A ports here, but the SD card slot and HDMI port should definitely reduce people&#39;s reliance on dongles.</p><p>Another old friend from MacBooks past has made a return here. Apple has implemented a new version of its MagSafe connector, which it used on its laptops for years prior to 2016. It’s different from the old connector, so you won’t be able to bust out a charger from years past and expect it to work, unfortunately. That said, you can still charge via USB-C if that&#39;s your jam.</p><p>The camera system has been improved here as well, with computational video and a 1080p resolution with an f/2.0 four-element lens. And the 16-inch laptop has a six-speaker system, with tweeters nearly two times larger than before. The keyboard, meanwhile, keeps the redesigned scissor switch mechanism, but the Touch Bar is gone, replaced with a standard function key row.</p><p>Battery life for these laptops should be pretty excellent. Apple says that the 14-inch model will run for 17 hours while playing video, while the 16-inch can last up to 21 hours. And they have fast charging, so you can get 50 percent of your battery life refilled in about 30 minutes.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, these laptops are also expensive. The 14-inch model starts at $1,999, while the 16-inch version starts at $2,499. Apple is also keeping the old-design 13-inch MacBook Pro with an M1 chip around for those who can&#39;t justify spending two grand or more on their next laptop.&nbsp;</p><p>The entry-level <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/14-inch">$1,999 14-inch configuration</a> comes with the M1 Pro with eight CPU cores, 14 graphics cores, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage. That&#39;s less performance than Apple promised out of the M1 Pro; to get the full 10-core CPU and 16-core graphics, you&#39;ll need to spend $2,499. That price bump also gets you 1TB of storage.&nbsp;</p><p>The base <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/16-inch">16-inch MacBook Pro</a> (<a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/16-inch">$2,499</a>) has almost the same specs as the $2,499 14-inch model: an M1 Pro with 10 CPU cores, 16 graphics cores, 16GB of RAM and 512GB of memory. Spending an extra $200 doubles the storage, bringing it to 1TB. If you want the M1 Max, you&#39;re looking to spend $3,499, with 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. You can pre-order now, and they&#39;ll be available on October 26th.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Apple’s Mac event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/mac%20event%202021"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/macbook-pro-2021-update-price-specs-release-date-173447695.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e32631a4-6de3-4ff3-a0ca-5626e8b01bde</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 17:34:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634582722</ingested><modified>2021-10-18T18:45:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/97969f70-303a-11ec-9fff-50d91433effd" width="2000" height="1300" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/97969f70-303a-11ec-9fff-50d91433effd" width="2000" height="1300" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Macbook Pro 2021 redesign]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Macbook Pro 2021 redesign]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[M1 Pro and M1 Max are Apple's high-end Mac chips]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s been almost a year since Apple unveiled its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-silicon-m1-mac-181040846.html">first custom chip for Macs, the ARM-based M1</a>. As we saw in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-140031323.html">our review of the latest MacBook Air</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-pro-m1-review-163011742.html">MacBook Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-imac-m1-review-24-inch-portable-desktop-130026556.html">colorful iMac</a>, the M1 was a marvel, proving to be both faster than Intel and AMD&#39;s x86 processors, while also drawing far less power. Now, in a follow-up move, Apple is taking a two-pronged approach with M1 Pro and M1 Max, the two chips underpinning the company&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-pro-2021-update-price-specs-release-date-173447695.html">new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d4224e90-3039-11ec-bde5-989a9e1afa90" alt="Apple M1 Pro" data-uuid="f2cf2536-35b2-38fb-863e-7b243c10a829"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>Both chips have 5nm 10-core processors, comprised of eight high-performance cores and two high-efficiency units. What separates them are their GPU and memory capabilities: the M1 Pro has up to a 16-core GPU while the Max has tops out at 32 graphics cores. In comparison, last year&#39;s M1 was an eight-core chip that maxed out with eight GPU cores. The M1 Pro comes with up to 32GB of RAM with 200 GB/s of bandwidth, while the M1 Max doubles both of those figures, supporting up to 64GB of RAM.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d420c7f0-3039-11ec-af5f-77c94976dcc0" alt="Apple M1 Max" data-uuid="d5e152d1-8a8f-3e6a-a92c-5783a1d75f82"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>Based on these specs, power users will see a much bigger performance upgrade by going for a MacBook Pro. Last year&#39;s M1-equipped 13-inch MacBook Pro wasn&#39;t much faster than the M1 Air; the Pro basically added a fan for more sustained workloads, whereas the Air was miraculously fanless. That was an odd situation for Apple: It was both a testament to the power of Apple silicon, and a sign that the company needed to devote more time to its powerful machines.</p><p>Given that the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-21-macbook-pro-16-inch-review-ultimate-apple-laptop.html">16-inch MacBook Pro </a>was practically forgotten over the past year, the M1 Pro and M1 Max are exactly what creative professionals have been waiting for. And that&#39;s before you get to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-pro-2021-update-price-specs-release-date-173447695.html">all of the other updates coming to the new notebooks</a> (More ports! An SD card slot!). Apple says the chips offer up to 1.7X faster performance than competing eight-core PC chips, which makes them particularly compelling for people doing heavy-duty 3D and video rendering.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Apple’s Mac event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/mac%20event%202021"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-m1-pro-m1-max-chips-macbook-pro-172415918.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a71ad9d6-435c-4a71-aaa2-c0111e6f4279</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 17:24:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634580657</ingested><modified>2021-10-18T18:11:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9d6db100-303e-11ec-abf7-2f2e15bed89c" width="2000" height="1300" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9d6db100-303e-11ec-abf7-2f2e15bed89c" width="2000" height="1300" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple M1 Pro and M1 Max chip]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple M1 Pro and M1 Max chip]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's redesigned AirPods bring Spatial Audio and Adaptive EQ for $179]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There&#39;s no denying the popularity of <a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods/">Apple&#39;s AirPods</a>, but <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-03-apple-airpods-review-2019-more-of-the-same.html">the regular model</a> has been overdue for a refresh. Announced in spring 2019, the second generation of the company&#39;s true wireless earbuds brought improvements like faster pairing, hands-free Siri and wireless charging. While <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-1000xm4-review-160006474.html">some companies</a> are cranking out <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-150002889.html">multiple models a year,</a> Apple hasn&#39;t needed to do that, hence the two-year gap <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-06-apple-airpods-pro-review.html">between new models</a>. Today, the company finally debuted the <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/introducing-the-next-generation-of-airpods/">third-iteration AirPods</a> with an updated design, Spatial Audio, Adaptive EQ and one-touch setup.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple says the newest AirPods are safe for workouts thanks to IPX4 sweat and water resistance. Hands-free Siri is back, while a skin sensor detects when you&#39;re wearing the earbuds, automatically pausing when one is removed. As for battery life, you can expect up to six hours of listening and 30 hours of total usage with the charging case. Speaking of the case, it supports MagSafe charging. Additionally, a new one-touch setup quickly pairs the buds with Apple products.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="56e4d834-a3ca-4a18-beb0-72a20d4c5b6a"/><p>With the third-gen AirPods, Apple is bringing Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking to its regular model. Head tracking also works with Group FaceTime calls so that voices sound like they&#39;re coming from the direction they&#39;re positioned on screen. Apple says this makes for a more immersive setup, so it sounds more like you&#39;re in the same room with other attendees. The company claims that support for the AAC-ELD codec enables improved speech quality and says its microphones are covered with &quot;acoustic mesh&quot; to help reduce wind noise.</p><p>Apple also equipped its new AirPods with Adaptive EQ. This technology tunes the audio in real time according to inward-facing mics that monitor sound. Computational audio adjusts low and mid-range frequencies as any variances occur. This works like Adaptive EQ on AirPods Pro and AirPods Max, so Apple is extending much of the tech-heavy features from its pricier models to the base AirPods.&nbsp;</p><p>The third-generation AirPods are up for <a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods/">pre-order at Apple </a>and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Amazon today" href="https://amzn.to/3DLhN5o">Amazon today</a> for $179 and will begin shipping on October 26th.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Apple’s Mac event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/mac%20event%202021"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-third-gen-announced-price-specs-availability-171540519.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4236020e-d35d-4871-8722-ac2d74889129</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 17:15:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634633879</ingested><modified>2021-10-19T08:58:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a063b920-3036-11ec-b7d7-7c35df5aba66" width="2000" height="1300" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a063b920-3036-11ec-b7d7-7c35df5aba66" width="2000" height="1300" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Airpods]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Airpods]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
