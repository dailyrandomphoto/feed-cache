Adorama has a one-day-only sale that knocks $60 off the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Nest Hub Max" href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/gbr3b9">Nest Hub Max</a>, bringing it down to $169. That&#39;s even cheaper than we saw it a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/googles-second-gen-nest-hub-drops-to-60-in-new-years-sale-144818377.html">couple of weeks ago</a> when a bunch of Nest gadgets were discounted across the web, and it&#39;s $11 less than the device&#39;s Black Friday price last year.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/gbr3b9" id="5737fc2cabd7449a92e8ab77325bb20c" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Adorama;elmt:impactRadius;pdid:">Buy Nest Hub Max at Adorama - $169</a><p>The Nest Hub Max earned a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-09-google-nest-hub-max-review.html">score of 86</a> from us when it first came out in 2019 and it remains a good option for those that rely on the Google Assistant and want a larger home hub with advanced smart features. It has a spacious 10-inch HD touchscreen on which you can do things like take a Zoom call, watch YouTube or Netflix and control all of the smart lights, thermostats and other gadgets in your home. Its stereo speakers help it sound better than the smaller Nest Hubs, so it&#39;ll be good for both video watching and music playing.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The built-in camera lets you do more than just take video calls. It enables Face Match, which is similar to Google&#39;s Voice Match feature in that it recognizes who&#39;s using the device so it can display information relevant to you including calendar alerts, messages and more. If you have more than one person in the house using the Hub Max, this feature will come in handy. The Hub Max also supports gesture controls, which allow you to do things like raise a palm to the camera to pause a video or song that&#39;s playing.</p><p>While it takes up more space on a countertop than a Nest Cam, the Nest Hub Max can act as one in your home, too. You can use the Nest Cam app to pull up the feed from the device&#39;s built-in camera, letting you keep watch over your home when you&#39;re away. So while most smart displays are multi-use devices, you&#39;re truly getting a lot of bang for your buck with the Nest Hub Max — especially when it&#39;s on sale like this.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/googles-nest-hub-max-is-down-to-169-for-today-only-135837558.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e5dd5acd-c918-4f60-bb6a-db3a323c8d7d</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jan 2022 13:58:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1643032718</ingested><modified>2022-01-24T13:58:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?crop=1600%2C900%2C0%2C0&amp;quality=85&amp;format=jpg&amp;resize=1600%2C900&amp;image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2019-09%2F414de310-d279-11e9-abff-9856370604f2&amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;signature=a5280533e0a8851e944d61a7cb20b42c1479cd29" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?crop=1600%2C900%2C0%2C0&amp;quality=85&amp;format=jpg&amp;resize=1600%2C900&amp;image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2019-09%2F414de310-d279-11e9-abff-9856370604f2&amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;signature=a5280533e0a8851e944d61a7cb20b42c1479cd29" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google&#39;s Nest Hub Max is down to $169 for today only]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: The Steam Deck will support Epic's anti-cheat software]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Cheating is rife across many gaming platforms, but the biggest cheaters are usually found around PC gaming — despite games companies banning thousands, if not <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-03-apex-legends-blocked-cheater-accounts.html">hundreds of thousands</a> of the scamps.

Per a tweet spotted by <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-s22-europe-prices-leak/"><em>Android Police</em></a> from <em>WinFuture’s</em><a href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1484689280425414661?s=20">Roland Quandt</a>, European pricing for the Galaxy S22 series will start at €849 (roughly $1,018), with the base models of the Galaxy S22 Plus and Ultra slated to cost €1,049 ($1,188) and €1,249 ($1,414), respectively. Effectively, this means in 2022 Samsung’s Galaxy S lineup will cost just as much as it did in 2021. What’s more, Quandt’s tweet suggests the company will continue its practice of charging a €50 premium for a storage bump on the standard and Plus models.</p><div id="98ce939bd95744ba83b7f447d5a6f52f"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Whoever said S22 series was to be cheaper, didn&#39;t think of Covid, parts shortages and inflation.<br><br>Actual official EURO prices:<br>S22 8/128GB = 849<br>S22 8/256GB = 899<br>S22+ 8/128GB = 1049<br>S22+ 8/256GB = 1099<br>S22 Ultra 8/128GB = 1249<br>S22 Ultra 12/256GB = 1349<br>S22 Ultra 12/512GB = 1449 <a href="https://t.co/QRnfrhkzTz">pic.twitter.com/QRnfrhkzTz</a></p>— Roland Quandt (@rquandt) <a href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1484689280425414661?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 22, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>What may change is that Samsung could tweak the base model Ultra variant to offer less value than its predecessor. In Europe at least, the €1249 Galaxy S22 Ultra will ship with 8GB of RAM, according to Quandt, and cost the same amount as money as the entry-level Galaxy S21 Ultra, which features 12GB of RAM. Consumers in Europe will reportedly need to pay a €100 premium to get the S22 Ultra with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. It’s not clear if Samsung will implement the same pricing strategy in the US. As <em>Android Police </em>points out, a <a href="https://twitter.com/chunvn8888/status/1480953702177406979">separate leak</a> earlier this month suggested the company could charge an extra $100 stateside for every model in the Galaxy S22 lineup. As always, we’ll have to wait until the company shares official pricing information before we know just how much it will cost to own the latest Galaxy S phones.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-base-model-pricing-leak-224247167.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">603d2b77-1960-4df2-8a84-8b84a6737cd2</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jan 2022 22:42:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1643014267</ingested><modified>2022-01-24T08:51:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/363cb2a0-7c9d-11ec-bedf-ccd8cc7a4a95" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/363cb2a0-7c9d-11ec-bedf-ccd8cc7a4a95" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Evan Blass]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Galaxy S22 Ultra]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Galaxy S22 Ultra]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[PlatinumGames’ long-awaited shoot ’em up ‘Sol Cresta’ arrives February 22nd]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>PlatinumGames will release <a href="https://www.engadget.com/platinumgames-sol-cresta-182819964.html"><em><ins>Sol Cresta</ins></em></a> on February 22nd, the studio <a href="https://twitter.com/platinumgames/status/1485130371398209536?s=20">announced this weekend</a>.

In a <a href="https://cdn.hcourt.gov.au/assets/cases/06-Melbourne/m86-2021/Google-App.pdf"><ins>filing</ins></a> the search giant made on Friday, Google claims it will be forced to “act as censor” if the country’s highest court doesn’t overturn a decision that awarded a lawyer $40,000 in defamation damages for an article the company had linked to through its search engine, reports <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/24/google-warns-of-devastating-impact-if-court-ruling-on-defamatory-hyperlinks-not-overturned"><em><ins>The Guardian</ins></em></a>.</p><p>In 2016, George Defteros, a Victoria state lawyer whose past client list included individuals implicated in Melbourne&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_gangland_killings"><ins>notorious gangland killings</ins></a>, contacted Google to ask the company to remove a 2004 article from <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/gangland-lawyer-wins-40k-in-google-suit-20200430-p54onz.html"><em><ins>The Age</ins></em></a>. The piece featured reporting on murder charges prosecutors filed against Defteros related to the death of three men. Those charges were later dropped in 2005. The company refused to remove the article from its search results as it viewed the publication as a reputable source.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The matter eventually went to court with Defteros <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/30/melbourne-gangland-lawyer-george-defteros-wins-defamation-case-against-google">successfully arguing</a> the article and Google’s search results had defamed him. The judge who oversaw the case ruled <em>The Age’s </em>reporting had implied Defteros had been cozy with Melbourne’s criminal underground. The Victorian Court of Appeals subsequently rejected a bid by Google to overturn the ruling.</p><p>From Google’s perspective, at issue here is one of the fundamental building blocks of the internet. “A hyperlink is not, in and of itself, the communication of that to which it links,” the company contends in its submission to the High Court. If the 2020 judgment is left to stand, Google claims it will make it “liable as the publisher of any matter published on the web to which its search results provide a hyperlink,” including news stories that come from reputable sources. In its defense, the company points to a <a href="https://globalfreedomofexpression.columbia.edu/cases/crookes-v-newton/"><ins>2011 ruling</ins></a> from the Supreme Court of Canada that held a hyperlink by itself is never a publication of defamatory material.</p><p>We’ve reached out to Google for comment.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-australia-high-court-appeal-194529237.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c44dd01d-a900-4250-929b-def1a3bbfeb4</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jan 2022 19:45:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642967130</ingested><modified>2022-01-23T19:45:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Crime & Justice]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-11/de23acd0-0b84-11ea-9b76-9559e1097c73" width="3970" height="2703" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-11/de23acd0-0b84-11ea-9b76-9559e1097c73" width="3970" height="2703" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Reuters Staff / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A sign is pictured outs a Google offcie near the company's headquarters in Mountain View, California, U.S., May 8, 2019.

According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/21/arts/television/billions-peloton-premiere.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/23/22895860/peloton-billions-heart-attack-mr-big-showtime-tv"><em>The Verge</em></a>, the premiere episode of <em>Billions</em> season six includes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQdhtNHcOjQ&amp;t=360s">a scene</a> that, like the <em>Sex and the City</em> follow-up <em>And Just Like That</em>, paints Peloton&#39;s Bike in a less-than-flattering light — if not quite as dire as before.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The scene depicts Mike &quot;Wags&quot; Wagner (played by David Costabile) having a heart attack while riding his Peloton spin bike. Unlike the <em>And Just Like That</em> scene, however, Wagner survives — he even references the <em>AJLT</em> scene, telling staff that he&#39;s &quot;not going out&quot; like that character. <em>Billions</em>&#39; executive producers told <em>The Times</em> the moment was filmed in spring 2021, months before <em>AJLT</em>&#39;s debut, and that the team overdubbed the reference to the other show in postproduction to reflect &quot;what Wags would say.&quot;</p><p>Peloton stressed in a statement to Engadget that it hadn&#39;t provided the Bike or otherwise greenlit the use of its brand for <em>Billions</em>. It even celebrated parts of the episode, noting that the show highlighted the &quot;strong benefits&quot; of a cardio workout. When the <em>AJLT</em> scene caused a panic, Peloton faulted the character&#39;s lifestyle and suggested the bike at least delayed the inevitable. It went on to create a promo to defend its products in response, although it pulled that ad soon after when the focus of the promo, actor Chris Noth, faced accusations of sexual assault.</p><p>The <em>Billions</em> scene isn&#39;t the biggest PR crisis Peloton has faced lately. The company&#39;s stock price plunged after a (since-denied) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peloton-bike-tread-production-paused-190538247.html">claim it halted production</a> due to slowing sales. However, it does illustrate Peloton&#39;s odd position. While its fitness gear is still considered iconic, the company is no longer quite so revered by shoppers or the entertainment business.</p><p>You can read Peloton&#39;s full statement below.</p><blockquote><p>We get why these fictional TV shows would want to include a brand that people love to talk about, but Showtime&#39;s use of Peloton&#39;s Bike+ and reference to a Peloton Instructor was not a brand, product, or instructor placement, and we did not agree for our brand and IP to be used on this show or provide any equipment. As referenced by the show itself, there are strong benefits of cardio-vascular exercise to help people lead long, happy lives.</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/billions-peloton-scene-171753484.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d55e8246-318c-4bd6-ba22-90672b88a63c</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jan 2022 17:17:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642975791</ingested><modified>2022-01-23T22:10:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Television]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/47a86a80-7c6a-11ec-ac5b-9e1ccdbde712" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/47a86a80-7c6a-11ec-ac5b-9e1ccdbde712" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jeff Neumann/Showtime]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Mike 'Wags' Wagner (David Costabile) in season 6 of 'Billions']]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Mike 'Wags' Wagner (David Costabile) in season 6 of 'Billions']]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Workers at Activision Blizzard’s Raven Software end strike action following union push]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Having announced plans recently to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-union-raven-software-communication-workers-of-america-174723576.html"><ins>form the first labor union within</ins></a> a North American AAA game developer, workers at Raven Software are ending their weeks-long strike action against publisher Activision Blizzard. &quot;Pending the recognition of our union, the Raven QA strike has ended,” Activision Blizzard worker advocacy group ABetterABK <a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK/status/1485043916877488130?s=20"><ins>said on Saturday in a tweet</ins></a> spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2022-01-23-raven-software-ends-strike-action-in-light-of-unionisation"><em><ins>Eurogamer</ins></em></a>. “Unused strike funds are being stored for future organizing [and] strike efforts.”</p><div id="418f1c730e6f46f6945749fc6de0d0c5"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pending the recognition of our union, the Raven QA strike has ended.

Raven is one of the developers that supports Activision’s Call of Duty franchise, and its QA team is specifically responsible for bugs and other technical issues in <em>Warzone</em>. When the action began, it had no planned end date, a first for the walkouts at Activision Blizzard. The publisher had reportedly <a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK/status/1483491941333360644"><ins>declined</ins></a> to meet with the striking workers, despite mounting pressure from <em>Warzone’s </em>community over the game’s current state.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On Friday, the 34 workers who said they plan to unionize with the Communication Workers of America (CWA) asked Activision Blizzard to recognize their group, the Game Workers Alliance, voluntarily. The company has until January 25th to respond to the workers. &quot;Activision Blizzard is carefully reviewing the request for voluntary recognition from the CWA, which seeks to organize around three dozen of the company’s nearly 10,000 employees,&quot; the company said on Friday.</p><p>If the company fails to respond to the group, it will file for a union election through the National Relations Broad. Since the collective has a supermajority of votes, with 78 percent of the 34-person unit supporting the action, they can form a union without voluntary recognition from Activision Blizzard.</p><p>News of the union drive at Raven comes in the same week that Microsoft announced its intent to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-133637845.html"><ins>buy Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion</ins></a>. Pending regulatory approval, the company expects the deal, which could have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-xbox-activision-blizzard-consolidation-exclusives-222028443.html">far-reaching ramifications</a> for the gaming industry, to close in June 2023.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/raven-software-end-strike-action-161117591.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5cf48e1e-17a1-4a9c-a03c-f527c6827c67</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jan 2022 16:11:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642954278</ingested><modified>2022-01-24T01:46:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Strikes]]></category><category><![CDATA[Labor Issues]]></category><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-05/9f43b450-8bb4-11ea-b7ff-a5c651570d90" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-05/9f43b450-8bb4-11ea-b7ff-a5c651570d90" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Infinity Ward]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Warzone]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Warzone]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Dark Souls 3' security hole lets attackers hijack your PC]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You might not want to play a <em>Dark Souls</em> game online for a while — not that you necessarily can.

On Friday, the company <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3137321254689909033">announced</a> titles that depend on Epic’s Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC) software can now run on the portable. Valve said adding Steam Deck support to titles that utilize EAC is “a simple process.” Developers won’t need to update their SDK version or make other time-consuming changes. With Valve adding <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arma-3-dayz-proton-battleye-support-224625719.html">BattlEye support</a> through its Proton compatibility layer for Linux late last year, the company said, “this means the two largest anti-cheat services are now easily supported on Proton and Steam Deck.” In practice, that should mean more of your favorite games will work with Valve’s handheld when it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/valve-steam-deck-delayed-february-2022-195957878.html">launches next month</a>.</p><p>Of course, it’s one thing for Valve to make it easy for developers to ensure their games run without issue on Steam Deck and a completely separate thing for them to do the necessary work to ensure compatibility. To that point, when Valve announced BattlEye support in December, it said all developers had to do was contact the company to enable the software for their title. And yet it’s still unclear whether some of the most popular multiplayer games on Steam that utilize BattlEye and EAC, including titles like <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> and <em>PUBG</em>, will work on day one of Steam Deck’s availability. Valve has tried to address some of that uncertainty with its recently announced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/valve-steam-deck-verified-compatibility-system-223810108.html">Deck Verified program</a>. This week, Valve added <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2022-01-20-steam-decks-first-batch-of-compatibility-rated-games-are-now-available-for-viewing">67 titles to the database</a>, 39 of which should run without issue on the device.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/valve-steam-deck-epic-easy-anti-cheat-software-205838918.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4946248f-6b36-4d9e-8fb8-f77f92858124</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jan 2022 20:58:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642949452</ingested><modified>2022-01-24T01:46:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d3679c50-e596-11eb-beb1-13c0fd5f32a1" width="1657" height="859" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d3679c50-e596-11eb-beb1-13c0fd5f32a1" width="1657" height="859" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Valve]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Valve Steam Deck]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Valve Steam Deck]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple pulls verification requirement for US education shoppers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week, Apple began requiring that students and teachers in the US <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-requires-verification-education-discounts-us-131255155.html"><ins>verify their identity</ins></a> through authentication service UNiDAYS before they could take advantage of the company’s discounted education pricing. The move closed a long-standing loophole that had allowed almost anyone to save money on an Apple device as long as they weren’t caught in a random check.</p><p>However, mere days after implementing that requirement, Apple has just as quickly removed it.

The outlet suggests the company may have made the change after some educators and school staff members complained they couldn’t verify their status through UNiDAYS properly, and therefore couldn’t obtain a discount on a product they wanted to buy.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It’s unclear if Apple plans to reimplement the requirement once it sorts out any potential issues with the system. For years, Apple has used UNiDAYS in many other countries, including the UK, to ensure only those who qualify for its education discounts can get them.

Copyright 2022.</em></p><hr><h2><strong>THE ROBOTS YOU CAN SEE: DRIVERLESS CARS, WAREHOUSING AND DISTRIBUTION, AND MANUFACTURING</strong></h2><p>Few sectors better illustrate the promises and fears of robotics than autonomous cars and trucks. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are essentially highspeed wheeled industrial robots powered by cutting-edge technologies of perception, machine learning, decision-making, regulation, and user interfaces. Their cultural and symbolic resonance has brought AVs to the forefront of excited press coverage about new technology and has sparked large investments of capital, making a potentially “driverless” future a focal point for hopes and fears of a new era of automation.</p><p>The ability to transport goods and people across the landscape under computer control embodies a dream of twenty-first-century technology, and also the potential for massive social change and displacement. In a driverless future, accidents and fatalities could drop significantly. The time that people waste stuck in traffic could be recovered for work or leisure. Urban landscapes might change, requiring less parking and improving safety and efficiency for all. New models for the distribution of goods and services promise a world where people and objects move effortlessly through the physical world, much as bits move effortlessly through the internet.</p><p>As recently as a decade ago, it was common to dismiss the notion of driverless cars coming to roads in any form. Federally supported university research in robotics and autonomy had evolved for two generations and had just begun to yield advances in military robotics. Yet today, virtually every carmaker in the world, plus many startups, have engaged to redefine mobility. The implications for job disruption are massive. The auto industry itself accounts for just over 5 percent of all private sector jobs, according to one estimate. Millions more work as drivers and in the web of companies that service and maintain these vehicles.</p><p>Task Force members John J. Leonard and David A. Mindell have both participated in the development of these technologies and, with graduate student Erik L. Stayton, have studied their implications. Their research suggests that the grand visions of automation in mobility will not be fully realized in the space of a few years.15 The variability and complexity of real-world driving conditions require the ability to adapt to unexpected situations that current technologies have not yet mastered. The recent tragedies and scandals surrounding the death of 346 people in two Boeing 737 MAX crashes stemming from flawed software and the accidents involving self-driving car-testing programs on public roads have increased public and regulatory scrutiny, adding caution about how quickly these technologies will be widely dispersed. The software in driverless cars remains more complex and less deterministic than that in airliners; we still lack technology and techniques to certify it as safe. Some even argue that solving for generalized autonomous driving is tantamount to solving for AGI.</p><p>Analysis of the best available data suggests that the reshaping of mobility around autonomy will take more than a decade and will proceed in phases, beginning with systems limited to specific geographies such as urban or campus shuttles (such as the recent product announcement from Zoox, an American AV company). Trucking and delivery are also likely use cases for early adoption, and several leading developers are focusing on these applications both in a fully autonomous mode and as augmented, “convoy” systems led by human drivers. In late 2020, in a telling shift for the industry from “robotaxis” to logistics, Uber sold its driverless car unit, having spent billions of dollars with few results. The unit was bought by Amazon-backed Aurora to focus the technology on trucking. More automated systems will eventually spread as technological barriers are overcome, but current fears about a rapid elimination of driving jobs are not supported.</p><p>AVs, whether cars, trucks, or buses, combine the industrial heritage of Detroit and the millennial optimism and disruption of Silicon Valley with a DARPA-inspired military vision of unmanned weapons. Truck drivers, bus drivers, taxi drivers, auto mechanics, and insurance adjusters are but a few of the workers expected to be displaced or complemented. This transformation will come in conjunction with a shift toward full electric technology, which would also eliminate some jobs while creating others. Electric cars require fewer parts than conventional cars, for instance, and the shift to electric vehicles will reduce work supplying motors, transmissions, fuel injection systems, pollution control systems, and the like. This change too will create new demands, such as for large scale battery production (that said, the power-hungry sensors and computing of AVs will at least partially offset the efficiency gains of electric cars). AVs may well emerge as part of an evolving mobility ecosystem as a variety of innovations, including connected cars, new mobility business models, and innovations in urban transit, converge to reshape how we move people and goods from place to place.</p><h2><strong>TRANSPORTATION JOBS IN A DRIVERLESS WORLD</strong></h2><p>The narrative on AVs suggests the replacement of human drivers by AI-based software systems, themselves created by a few PhD computer scientists in a lab. This is, however, a simplistic reading of the technological transition currently under way, as MIT researchers discovered through their work in Detroit. It is true that AV development organizations tend to have a higher share of workers with advanced degrees compared to the traditional auto industry. Even so, implementation of AV systems requires efforts at all levels, from automation supervision by safety drivers to remote managing and dispatching to customer service and maintenance roles on the ground.</p><p>Take, for instance, a current job description for “site supervisor” at a major AV developer. The job responsibilities entail overseeing a team of safety drivers focused in particular on customer satisfaction and reporting feedback on mechanical and vehicle-related issues. The job offers a mid-range salary with benefits, does not require a two- or four-year degree, but does require at least one year of leadership experience and communication skills. Similarly, despite the highly sophisticated machine learning and computer vision algorithms, AV systems rely on technicians routinely calibrating and cleaning various sensors both on the vehicle and in the built environment. The job description for field autonomy technician to maintain AV systems provides a mid-range salary, does not require a four-year degree, and generally requires only background knowledge of vehicle repair and electronics. Some responsibilities are necessary for implementation — including inventorying and budgeting repair parts and hands-on physical work—but not engineering.</p><p>The scaling up of AV systems, when it happens, will create many more such jobs, and others devoted to ensuring safety and reliability. Simultaneously, an AV future will require explicit strategies to enable workers displaced from traditional driving roles to transition to secure employment.</p><p>A rapid emergence of AVs would be highly disruptive for workers since the US has more than three million commercial vehicle drivers. These drivers are often people with high school or lower education or immigrants with language barriers. Leonard, Mindell, and Stayton conclude that a slower adoption timeline will ease the impact on workers, enabling current drivers to retire and younger workers to get trained to fill newly created roles, such as monitoring mobile fleets. Again, realistic adoption timelines provide opportunities for shaping technology, adoption, and policy. A 2018 report by Task Force Research Advisory Board member Susan Helper and colleagues discusses a range of plausible scenarios and found the employment impact of AVs to be proportional to the time to widespread adoption. Immediate, sudden automation of the fleet would, of course, put millions out of work, whereas a thirty-year adoption timeline could be accommodated by retirements and generational change.</p><p>Meanwhile, car-and-truck makers already make vehicles that augment rather than replace drivers. These products include high-powered cruise control and warning systems frequently found on vehicles sold today. At some level, replacement-type driverless cars will be competing with augmentation-type computer-assisted human drivers. In aviation, this competition went on for decades before unmanned aircraft found their niches, while human-piloted aircraft became highly augmented by automation. When they did arrive, unmanned aircraft such as the US Air Force’s Predator and Reaper vehicles required many more people to operate than traditional aircraft and offered completely novel capabilities, such as persistent, twenty-four-hour surveillance.</p><p>Based on the current state of knowledge, we estimate a slow shift toward systems that require no driver, even in trucking, one of the easier use cases, with limited use by 2030. Overall shifts in other modes, including passenger cars, are likely to be no faster.</p><p>Even when it’s achieved, a future of AVs will not be jobless. New business models, potentially entirely new industrial sectors, will be spurred by the technology. New roles and specialties will appear in expert, technical fields of engineering of AV systems and vehicle information technologies. Automation supervision or safety driver roles will be critical for levels of automation that will come before fully automated driving. Remote management or dispatcher, roles will bring drivers into control rooms and require new skills of interacting with automation. New customer service, field support technician, and maintenance roles will also appear. Perhaps most important, creative use of the technology will enable new businesses and services that are difficult to imagine today. When passenger cars displaced equestrian travel and the myriad occupations that supported it in the 1920s, the roadside motel and fast-food industries rose up to serve the “motoring public.” How will changes in mobility, for example, enable and shape changes in distribution and consumption?</p><p>Equally important are the implications of new technologies for how people get to work. As with other new technologies, introducing expensive new autonomous cars into existing mobility ecosystems will just perpetuate existing inequalities of access and opportunity if institutions that support workers don’t evolve as well. In a sweeping study of work, inequality, and transit in the Detroit region, Task Force researchers noted that most workers building Model T and Model A Fords on the early assembly lines traveled to work on streetcars, using Detroit’s then highly developed system. In the century since, particularly in Detroit, but also in cities all across the country, public transit has been an essential service for many workers, but it has also been an instrument facilitating institutional racism, urban flight to job-rich suburbs, and inequality. Public discourse and political decisions favoring highway construction often denigrated and undermined mass transit, with racial undertones. As a result, Black people and other minorities are much more likely to lack access to personal vehicles.</p><p>“Technology alone cannot remedy the mobility constraints” that workers face, the study concludes, “and will perpetuate existing inequities absent institutional change.” As with other technologies, deploying new technologies in old systems of transportation will exacerbate their inequalities by “shifting attention toward what is new and away from what is useful, practical, and needed.” Innovating in institutions is as important as innovating in machines; recent decades have seen encouraging pilot programs, but more must be done to scale those pilots to broader use and ensure accountability to the communities they intend to serve. “Transportation offers a unique site of political possibility.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-the-work-of-the-future-autor-mindell-reynolds-mit-press-163011680.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bbfa361c-984b-427d-8253-88fbfd92e695</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jan 2022 16:30:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641937521</ingested><modified>2022-01-11T21:45:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/646d87d0-7315-11ec-beb1-32080a300622" width="5403" height="3602" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/646d87d0-7315-11ec-beb1-32080a300622" width="5403" height="3602" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mike Blake / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Lidar, cameras and GPS sensors are shown on top of a Hyundai electric vehicle as self driving company Pony.ai begins to provide autonomous electric vehicles to deliver packages from local e-commerce platform Yamibuy during the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Irvine, California, U.S., April 28, 2020.

Smith, who was one of the organizers for the Amazon Labor Union (ALU), was <a href="https://www.nysfocus.com/2021/11/23/a-homeless-amazon-worker-tried-to-organize-a-union-then-amazon-fired-him/">fired</a> in October 2021. The group filed an unfair labor practices complaint with the NLRB after his dismissal, accusing the company of illegal retaliatory firing over Smith&#39;s outspoken support for unionization. Now, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-21/amazon-activist-s-firing-deemed-illegal-by-labor-board-officials?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the board has found merit in the group&#39;s allegations and plans to issue a formal complaint against the e-commerce giant if the case doesn&#39;t settle.&nbsp;</p><p>The Amazon Labor Union is made of up of former and current company workers and is an independent group not connected with major national unions. While the group failed to unionize Amazon&#39;s fulfillment centers in Staten Island last year, it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-workers-new-york-forming-a-union-123540725.html">refiled an application</a> with the NLRB in December — a hearing is scheduled for that request next month.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Smith wasn&#39;t the only ALU organizer that Amazon had fired. ALU president Chris Smalls also lost his job after he held a walkout at Amazon&#39;s JFK8 facility over the e-commerce giant&#39;s handling of COVID-19 safety at the warehouse in 2020. Amazon explained back then that Smalls &quot;received multiple warnings for violating social distancing guidelines.&quot;</p><p>The company has been adamantly anti-union and had once told <em>Engadget</em> in a statement that it doesn&#39;t &quot;think unions are the best answer for [its] employees.&quot; It added: &quot;Every day we empower people to find ways to improve their jobs, and when they do that we want to make those changes — quickly. That type of continuous improvement is harder to do quickly and nimbly with unions in the middle.&quot; After reaching a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-nlrb-deal-labor-rights-organizing-union-183602018.html">deal with the NLRB</a> in December, though, Amazon agreed to informs workers that they have the legal right to join, form or assist with a union through notices posted in workplaces, as well as on its mobile app and internal website.</p><p>As <em>Bloomberg </em>explains, NLRB brings complaints to agency judges if it finds merit in claims made by workers. The board&#39;s top prosecutor, Jennifer Abruzzo, one said she will &quot;aggressively&quot; seek court injunctions to get illegally fired employees back to work. ALU vice president Derrick Palmer, whom Amazon had disciplined for joining Smalls&#39; COVID-19 protest, said Smith being reinstated would be a huge support for the group: &quot;It would be monumental for him to go back to the same building that he was terminated from and speak his truth and let workers know that it’s OK to speak out.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nlrb-amazon-illegally-fired-union-organizer-new-york-101549596.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6e8bc5c2-570d-472e-bf3c-d397c1800adc</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jan 2022 10:15:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642846550</ingested><modified>2022-01-22T10:16:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Employment & Career]]></category><category><![CDATA[Unions]]></category><category><![CDATA[Labor Issues]]></category><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1efed3e0-7b5b-11ec-9e0e-b866f4d6e90a" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1efed3e0-7b5b-11ec-9e0e-b866f4d6e90a" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Pacific Press via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[2 METROTECH, NEW YORK, UNITED STATES - 2021/10/25: Supporters of organizing a union at Amazon Staten Island warehouse rally in front of the field office of National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) located at 2 MetroTech.

That&#39;s my main takeaway from <em>We Met in Virtual Reality</em>, the first documentary filmed entirely in VRChat, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival today.</p><p>There&#39;s no chance Zuck&#39;s metaverse would let people wear trademarked avatars without paying a ton, attend exotic clubs to receive (or give) virtual lapdances, or allow users to build whatever the hell they want. VRChat, as portrayed by <a href="https://joeahunting.com/"><ins>director Joe Hunting</ins></a>, is basically a proto-metaverse where anything is possible. And for many, it has served as a crucial social hub during the pandemic, a place where they can forget about the world, relax with friends and maybe find love.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But of course, that&#39;s been the nature of practically every online community. We&#39;re social animals — people have always been able to connect with each other over BBS, IRC, Usenet and the plethora of forums and chat services that populated the early internet. I spent most of the &#39;90s hanging out in anime and gaming chat rooms, the sorts of places that today&#39;s connected youth would probably find quaint. Still, the people I met there helped me survive the worst parts of middle and high school. Those relationships, and the internet itself, shaped me into who I am (for better or worse).</p><div id="668dbef7efbd4f55bc320eceb769cbab"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WSNJUngJ_fQ?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p><em>We Met in Virtual Reality </em>proves that the unbridled, experimental sense of online community is still alive and well today, despite relentless consolidation from Big Tech. But now, instead of staring at tiny CRT monitors, people are slapping on VR headsets to explore fully realized environments. Hardcore VRChat users are also investing in powerful computing rigs as well as upgrades like finger and whole-body tracking. In the &#39;90s, I was grateful to get another 16MB of RAM so that I could have more than one browser window open. Today, VRChat devotees can communicate using American Sign Language, or have their anime avatars show off their belly dancing skills.</p><p>Hunting approaches his subjects with the eye of an anthropologist, without any judgment towards their sometimes ridiculous avatars (do all the anime ladies need to have jiggly, <em>Dead or Alive</em>-level boob physics?). <em>We Met in Virtual Reality</em> begins as a chill hangout flick — we follow a group of friends as they have virtual drinks and go on joyrides in crudely-built VR cars — but it quickly moves beyond the novelty of its setting. One person credits their VRChat girlfriend for helping them to &quot;unmute&quot; after being silent for two years. An exotic performer explains that being able to dance for people in VRChat helped her grieve with a family tragedy and manage a bout of alcoholism.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/2d32a730-7b05-11ec-9a4e-3bac011df3b4" style="height:1125;width:2000;" alt="We Met in Virtual Reality" data-uuid="3a746b0e-7c27-3122-b1d5-9357971273c9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Joe Hunting</div></figure><p>The film chronicles how that exotic dancer, a young woman based in the UK, formed a romantic relationship with another VRChat user in Miami. These sorts of cyber relationships aren’t anything new, but the VR platform allowed them to do much more than trade links and memes over IM. They could exist in a space together, go on dates to new environments every night. I won’t spoil where things end up for the couple, but I can say that it wouldn’t have been nearly as effective outside of VR.</p><p><em>We Met in Virtual Reality </em>effectively conveys why people would gravitate towards VRChat, especially during a pandemic. But it doesn&#39;t fully capture the wonder of exploring these environments yourself. Seeing people hop on a virtual rollercoaster isn&#39;t nearly as thrilling as doing it, where your entire field of vision is covered and you can easily get vertigo. But I don&#39;t blame Hunting too much for that; his job was to boil down the VR experience so people can enjoy it on a 2D screen, and the film is mostly successful in that respect. The film was shot using a virtual camera that could mimic all of the functionality of a typical shooter, from focus points to aperture levels.
