As <em>9to5Mac</em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/26/gurman-iphone-14-to-feature-a-complete-redesign/">notes</a>, <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s historically accurate Mark Gurman claimed the iPhone 14 will represent a &quot;complete redesign&quot; — the first since the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-11-03-apple-iphone-x-review.html">iPhone X</a> arrived in 2017. The relatively modest iPhone 13 update was a hint that bigger things were coming, he said. Gurman was shy on details of what that new hardware would entail, but earlier rumors might offer a clue as to what to expect.</p><p>Most notably, frequently accurate analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently claimed Apple would begin dropping the display notch entirely in 2022, starting with an iPhone 14 Pro that would use a hole-punch front camera like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-camera-samples-screen-specs-160033680.html">many Android phones</a>. YouTuber Jon Prosser also <a href="https://www.frontpagetech.com/2021/09/08/exclusive-a-closer-first-look-at-iphone-14/">claimed</a> to have renders based on real-world photos of the new iPhone. The new model would supposedly resemble a supersized <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-06-22-iphone-4-review.html">iPhone 4</a> with a band-like titanium outer ring, flush rear cameras and a thicker chassis.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Other rumors suggest Apple might drop a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html">mini iPhone</a> from the lineup, replacing it with a larger &#39;regular&#39; model as well as the usual Pro offerings. There have been murmurs of under-display Touch ID, but it&#39;s not certain if this would be ready for 2022, if at all.</p><p>We&#39;d take the reports with some caution. No matter how accurate the reports might be, the next iPhone is roughly a year away. There&#39;s still a chance Apple could make substantial changes before it locks in the design for production. Whatever the end result, the common theme of the leaks suggests the iPhone 14 could be an important revamp.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-14-redesign-leak-152422684.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f7f0c889-a4d0-4ef9-b432-1961900a3ed4</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 26 Sep 2021 15:24:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632669865</ingested><modified>2021-09-26T15:24:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/9213c0a0-1ed8-11ec-a7fd-a6bf9eb4f536" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/9213c0a0-1ed8-11ec-a7fd-a6bf9eb4f536" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 13 Pro in gold — back view]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 13 Pro in gold — back view]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's 2021 iPad drops to $299 at Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Don&#39;t worry if you missed out on an earlier deal for Apple&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-a13-bionic-171718680.html">2021 iPad</a>.

A Nintendo of America rep told the publication that &quot;different regions make different decisions based on a variety of factors&quot; and that the three-button model was the more widely used and more well-known version in the US and Canada. As the publication notes, the three-button model came first, and the one with six buttons was only released when fighting games boomed in popularity. Playing titles like <em>Street Fighter</em> was easier with more buttons to mash. Take note that the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-12-sega-genesis-mini-review.html">Sega Genesis Mini</a> also launched with a three-button controller outside Japan in 2019, whereas the Japanese version came with a six-button model.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Even if you find a way to import the Japan-only controller, it may be better to wait until other gamers have confirmed that it works with consoles in your region.

Also, Devindra Hardawar found one more reason to recommend the Dell XPS 15, and Mat Smith took some average selfie’s with the ZTE Axon 30’s &quot;invisible&quot; front-facing camera.</p><h2>The iPhone 13 and 13 mini are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html">made for shutterbugs</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/fcc02040-1a9d-11ec-b679-b593aac40b57" style="height:1013;width:1800;" alt="An iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 next to each other with their screens facing the camera." data-uuid="0d3b3232-2d48-35ee-9cfd-deb1d2471b09"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>On paper, Cherlynn Low says there’s not much to get excited about when it comes to the new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:iPhone 13 and 13 Mini" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/NKbx1P">iPhone 13 and 13 mini</a>. The incremental upgrades like the bigger batteries, better displays and faster chips all feel like standard, annual improvements. The key features of the new handsets are the enhancements made to the cameras. The rear sensors have been improved, the ultra wide lens lets in more light and the A15 chip has a faster image signal processor.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Cherlynn particularly liked the addition of Photographic Styles, which allows the user to choose a profile of contrast levels and color temperature for photos. And she said Cinematic Mode, which blurs out the background behind a subject, was the most intriguing of the new video features. But at its default intensity, the blurriness looked strange and artificial — and Cinematic Mode only works at 1080p/30fps, regardless of the quality you’ve set your camera to record.</p><p>Other aspects of the handsets were largely similar to previous models: the speakers are still good enough for video watching, and both phones easily handled switching between multiple apps, uploading photos and other tasks. However, Cherlynn was quick to point out that the phones still feature 60Hz screens, which made them feel laggy in comparison to handsets that have speedier displays. Overall she said that, as expected, they’re excellent (if a bit boring) phones with little to complain about.</p><h2>The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-review-120-hz-promotion-screen-macro-camera-cinematic-mode-samples-battery-life-143041678.html">impress with smooth screens</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a6f68610-1d61-11ec-bbfb-9fa94e0433d1" alt="Apple iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max" data-uuid="bff86cfe-94c9-34ed-8436-cb0ae0ccc945"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>Cherlynn Low says make no mistake about it: The one thing that really makes the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/NKbx1P">iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro</a> Max stand out is the new ProMotion display. With faster screens that can adjust their refresh rates depending on the task, the handsets are finally able to take advantage of their big OLED displays, whether you’re watching video or simply scrolling social media. The two new models are also 25 percent brighter for better outdoor viewing and, thanks to the 5-core GPU on the Pro, able to handle graphics-intensive tasks more quickly.</p><p>Cherlynn said that the A15 Bionic chip combined with the faster refresh rate made everything from YouTube and music streaming to <em>Catan </em>gaming and chatting with friends seem much more responsive. The two new Pro models also have an additional telephoto camera and a new macro photography mode, but all of that power comes with extra weight. The 6.1-inch 13 Pro is 7.19 ounces and the 6.7-inch 13 Pro Max clocks in at 8.46 ounces; Cherlynn said the bigger handset was uncomfortable to use one-handed for more than a few minutes. If that isn’t a dealbreaker, then she says either of the phones would make a worthy upgrade for iOS users.</p><h2>The iPad mini gets a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-mini-6th-generation-2021-review-130009170.html">much needed refresh</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/dc444e60-1d61-11ec-b7fb-4084947eaed0" alt="Apple iPad Mini 2021" data-uuid="5b49165c-2c3f-35af-add9-03b2999ba811"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valentina Palladino / Engadget</div></figure><p>While the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:iPad Mini" href="https://amzn.to/3lVJpxj">iPad mini</a> has a dedicated fan base, it hasn’t changed much since its debut nine years ago. But the 2021 release of the tiny tablet features enough upgrades to make it feel like a smaller iPad Air. Valentina Palladino says that the new “all-screen” design, flat edges, TouchID-capable top button, second-gen Apple Pencil support and USB-C charging all provide a much needed refresh for the tablet. The bezels helped her keep a comfortable grip on the device while reading and making FaceTime calls, and the lightweight 100-percent recycled aluminum body made it easy to tote around.</p><p>Valentina also liked that the new design allowed the second-generation Apple Pencil to magnetically stick to the right edge of the tablet. She reports that the mini makes a capable digital notebook thanks in part to the Pencil and the Quick Notes feature in iPadOS 15. Additionally, she said the A15 Bionic chip and the larger screen make it easy to use the device in place of an iPhone for a wide variety of tasks including video streaming and light gaming. However, the new mini only comes in 64GB and 256GB models — with a $150 price difference between them — and those are notable differences in capacity and cost. Valentina says the significant update will be great for small-tablet lovers, but she’s not sure if the iPad mini will win over others in the market for a standard-sized iPad.</p><h2>Dell’s XPS 15 is an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dell-xps-15-oled-review-practically-perfect-15-inch-screen-laptop-120033751.html">even better laptop with an OLED screen</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1df48f50-1d62-11ec-bb3f-c5d820f98da3" alt="Dell XPS 15 OLED" data-uuid="aa72697f-132a-3c33-a862-3e81dd5f4aa3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Devindra Hardawar was already a fan of Dell’s excellent <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:XPS 15 laptop" href="https://bit.ly/3lOELBj">XPS 15 laptop</a>, but he says the addition of an OLED screen makes the whole package even better. The star of the show, the 15.6-inch display, has some of the thinnest bezels on the market and uses a 3.5K OLED touchscreen that supports Dolby Vision HDR (of course, this panel costs extra, and there are two LCD options to choose from, too). While watching the new <em>Matrix</em> trailer, it displayed true blacks, brilliant elements like explosions and juggled scenes with bright and dark aspects.</p><p>Devindra said he’d never had as much fun scrolling through websites due to the incredibly crisp text. The only additional improvement he could think of was a faster refresh rate, however, he had no complaints about the performance from the eight-core Intel i7 CPU or the 45-watt version of NVIDIA’s RTX 3050 Ti GPU, which transcoded a one-minute 4K video file into 1080p in 35 seconds. Devindra says you can expect it to tackle most intense workloads with ease, and although it’s not a gaming machine, it’s capable of reaching 70fps in <em>Overwatch</em> at the highest graphic settings.</p><h2>The ZTE Axon 30 smartphone <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zte-axon-30-review-153209819.html">offers an invisible selfie camera</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/831cb560-1d62-11ec-9d23-0ef08dd343be" alt="ZTE Axon 30" data-uuid="6bc9263f-1f81-333b-85c3-eff7cd39b645"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget, Mat Smith</div></figure><p>A sequel to the Axon 20, <a href="https://ztedevices.com/en-gl/axon-30/">ZTE’s Axon 30</a> touts an improved 16-megapixel, under-display camera (UDC) with a dedicated chip that keeps the area consistent with the rest of the screen. In practice, Mat Smith was pleased to report that the UDC is nearly invisible but he was less impressed with the resulting photographs. His selfies had fuzzy details and suffered from lens flares and washout due to strong backlighting. Mat got much better images when shooting with the four-camera array on the back, which includes a 64-megapixel Sony sensor.</p><p>However, the Axon 30 has more to offer for its $500 price tag: The smartphone also features a 6.92-inch AMOLED screen with 2,460 x 1,080 resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate. And it’s powered by a Snapdragon 870 processor, which handled everything Mat threw at it from Stadia gaming to video streaming. It also has a stand-out battery that lasted two days of typical use with the 120Hz refresh rate off, and the handset can recharge to 100 percent in under an hour. Mat liked the new MyOS 11 skin, which closely mimics the stock Google experience, save for a few shortcuts and widgets. But the smartphone lacks wireless charging and certified resistance against dust and water, and Mat says the 5G support isn’t great in the U.S. as it will only work on T-Mobile’s midband 5G network.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/icymi-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-apple-iphone-13-160028878.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">56fd36f5-b9cc-4b8e-8a64-0798a6d364db</guid><dc:creator>Amber Bouman</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 25 Sep 2021 16:00:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632510725</ingested><modified>2021-09-24T19:12:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Amber Bouman]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2487e970-1a9c-11ec-9fdd-7a2e61c7e295" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2487e970-1a9c-11ec-9fdd-7a2e61c7e295" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A green iPhone 12 and pink iPhone 13 with their backs facing the camera.

Unlike gold, which derives its value from both its myriad uses in fashion and industry as well as the difficulty involved in extracting it from the Earth, acquiring new Bitcoin is as simple as digitally mining more of the stuff. In his latest book, <a href="https://www.futureofmoneybook.com/the-book/"><em>The Future of Money</em></a>, Senior Professor of Trade Policy at Cornell University, Eswar S Prasad deftly examines how we collectively assign value to these digital constructs and what that means for the economics of tomorrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/0e55b500-17ff-11ec-995d-f1e6a9a0b225" alt="The Future of Money dust cover" data-uuid="9cfaceeb-7934-33c4-b8cd-02785e59c81c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Harvard University Press</div></figure><p>Copyright © 2021 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College.

High and rising real estate valuations seemed to be based on the notion that all it took to make money from a house purchased at inflated prices was to find just one buyer—an even greater fool than oneself—willing to pay an even higher price.</p><p>Carney’s speech came on the heels of another by Agustín Carstens, head of the Bank for International Settlements; he described Bitcoin as “a combination of a bubble, a Ponzi scheme and an environmental disaster.” Skeptics, including central bankers and academics, correctly note Bitcoin’s extremely volatile prices and the periodic price collapses it has experienced. Indeed, from an economist’s perspective, there is no logical reason Bitcoin should be priced beyond its value in providing an anonymous payment mechanism, let alone the sort of value it commands. Yet, even as it has shed all pretense of being an effective medium of exchange, Bitcoin has maintained the faith of its adherents. It seems not just to persevere but has become an increasingly prized store of value—or perhaps more accurately, an attractive speculative asset (at least as this book is being written—this could all change in a moment). What accounts for this?</p><p>To address this question, we must first consider what gives a financial asset, tangible or not, economic value. For one thing, an asset represents a claim on future goods and services. Owning a share of stock or debt issued by a firm is a claim on the firm’s future earnings, which in turn is based on its ability to create real products or services that have monetary value. The same is true for real estate, which yields real services to homeowners or renters that can be monetized. Owning a government bond is in principle a claim on future government revenues, which could come from taxes or other sources.</p><p>Gold is dif­ferent. It has an intrinsic value based on its industrial use, and it is also used in jewelry (and tooth fillings). But its market value seems far greater than its intrinsic value based on these uses. It appears that gold derives its value mainly from scarcity rather than its usefulness or any claim it offers of a future flow of goods and services. Scarcity by itself is clearly not enough; there has to be enough demand for an asset as well. Such demand could hang on a thread as slender as a collective belief in the market value of the asset—if you think there are other people who value gold as much as you do and enough people feel the same way, gold has value.</p><p>So is Bitcoin just a digital version of gold, with its value determined mainly by its scarcity? The limit of twenty-one million bitcoins is hardcoded into the algorithm, making it scarce by construction. But there still needs to be demand for it, as even Bitcoin cannot escape the basic laws of market economics, especially the determination of prices based on supply and demand. Such demand could of course be purely speculative in nature, as seems to be the case now that Bitcoin is not working well as a medium of exchange.</p><p>It does take copious amounts of computing power and electricity to mine Bitcoin, and unfortunately, computers and electricity have to be paid for in real money—which is still represented by fiat currencies. It has been argued that Bitcoin’s baseline price is determined by this mining cost. One research company estimated the electricity cost of mining one bitcoin in the United States to be about $4,800 in 2018. Another company estimated the overall break-even cost of mining a bitcoin in 2018 at $8,000, suggesting that this constituted a floor for its price. But this is hardly reasonable logic. Just because something takes a lot of resources to produce is not enough to create demand for it and, therefore, to justify its price.</p><p>Bitcoin devotees, needless to say, have an answer for this; given the technologically inclined nature of this community, it had to be a quantitative model. The model, if it can be called that, uses the ratio of the existing stock relative to the flow of new units as an anchor for the price.</p><p>Consider gold. The total stock of gold that exists in the world (above ground) is estimated at about 185,000 metric tons. Roughly 3,000 tons of gold are mined each year, which amounts to about 1.6 percent of the existing stock. Thus, the stock-to-flow ratio is about sixty. It would take that many years for annual gold production, assuming it continues at the average rate, to reproduce the existing stock. For silver, this ratio is about twenty-two. The logic of this pricing model appears to be that even doubling the annual rate of gold or silver production would leave their stock-to-flow ratios high, in which case they would remain viable stores of value with high prices. The physical constraints on supply—ramping up mining operations would take a long time—mean there is little risk of a surge in supply knocking down prices of the existing stock. By contrast, for other less precious commodities, including metals such as copper and platinum, the existing stock is equal to or lower than annual production. Thus, as soon as the price begins rising, production can be ramped up, preventing large price hikes. With these commodities, prices are more closely tied to values based on industrial and other practical uses.</p><p>In 2017 the stock of Bitcoin that had been mined was estimated to be around twenty-five times larger than that of the new coins produced in that year. This is high but still less than half of the stock-to-flow ratio for gold. Around 2022, Bitcoin’s stock-to-flow ratio is expected to overtake that for gold. Thus, if one accepts this logic, the price of Bitcoin must eventually rise.</p><p>This valuation is built entirely on a fragile foundation of faith. As one influential Bitcoin blogger puts it: “Bitcoin is the first scarce digital object the world has ever seen. . . . Surely this digital scarcity has value.” This blogger makes profuse allusions, which are echoed on most websites and chat boards frequented by Bitcoin adherents, to how Bitcoin and gold are analogous: “It is [the] consistently low rate of supply of gold that is the fundamental reason it has maintained its monetary role throughout human history. The high stock-to-flow ratio of gold makes it the commodity with the lowest price elasticity of supply.” Fiat money and other cryptocurrencies that have no supply cap, no Proof of Work consensus protocol, and no need of large amounts of computing power to keep operating are seen as less likely to retain value because their supplies are not constrained and can be influenced by the government or small groups of individuals or stakeholders.</p><p>Clearly, logic and reason are not important underpinnings of Bitcoin valuations. And it is hard to argue, as I have learned, with a twenty-fiveyear-old who bought his first bitcoin at $400, then kept buying, and now views every dip in Bitcoin prices as a buying opportunity to add to his stash. But, as an economist, one does worry for that young man (whom I sat next to at a conference in January 2019 and with whom I ended up having a long and heated discussion) and others who have bet their life savings on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Then again, with the price of Bitcoin where it is in April 2021, perhaps my time would have been better spent in the past few years acquiring some bitcoin rather than laboring on this book.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-the-future-of-money-eswar-prasad-harvard-university-press-153024975.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0988ca7c-19f0-4ac9-a579-b834e6db9f98</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 25 Sep 2021 15:30:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632510018</ingested><modified>2021-09-24T19:00:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Commodity Markets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5ea7d740-17ff-11ec-9ffd-ff33ac942d83" width="3500" height="2376" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5ea7d740-17ff-11ec-9ffd-ff33ac942d83" width="3500" height="2376" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Pawel Kopczynski / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A mock Bitcoin is displayed on a table in an illustration picture taken in Berlin January 7, 2014.

According to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/24/apple-told-a-showbiz-union-it-had-less-than-20-million-tv-subscribers.html"><em>CNBC</em></a>, the tech giant told the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees that TV+ has fewer than 20 million subscribers in the US and Canada. A few months ago, Statista <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1136261/number-of-apple-tv-plus-subscribers-us/">published</a> an estimate that puts the service&#39;s subscriber number to 40 million by the end of 2020 in the US alone.&nbsp;</p><p>The firm admitted, however, that the estimate does not &quot;necessarily reveal how many paying subscribers use the service.&quot; <em>CNBC</em> didn&#39;t say whether the 20 million subscribers the company declared were paying customers either. It also didn&#39;t mention how many of those got their subscriptions for free: Apple used to give away year-long subscriptions to customers who purchase new iPhones, iPads and Macs, but it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-plus-free-trial-reduced-july-1-105546762.html">shortened</a> the offer to three months back in June.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to the report, having less than 20 million subscribers allowed Apple to pay production crew lower rates than bigger streamers. Under the current contract seen by <em>CNBC</em>, streaming services can pay their employees lower rates if they report less than 20 million subscribers to the IATSE every July 1st, because streaming profitability is &quot;presently uncertain.&quot; The union is negotiating for a better contract, though, since current rules don&#39;t make an exception for tech giants like Apple. It also argues that streaming can no longer be considered &quot;new media.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>An Apple rep told <em>CNBC</em> that the company pays in line with leading streaming services but refused to comment on the claimed subscriber number. 20 million is but a fraction of the number of subscribers the biggest streaming services have: Netflix claimed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-q1-2021-201731732.html">208 million subscribers</a> in April, while Disney+ claimed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-100-million-subscribers-192533901.html">over 100 million</a> back in March.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-showbiz-union-tv-service-20-million-subscribers-124041017.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ebea5728-f04d-49fc-b503-b74721c4a2d4</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 25 Sep 2021 12:40:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632573644</ingested><modified>2021-09-25T12:40:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/3fdcc160-1dde-11ec-bd9e-5b815a90d32b" width="1960" height="1104" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/3fdcc160-1dde-11ec-bd9e-5b815a90d32b" width="1960" height="1104" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter shows off new concepts for filtering and limiting replies]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Twitter has been trying to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-launches-reply-limits-to-all-users-173007909.html">limit the toxic replies</a> you can get on its website by giving you tools that allow you to be more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-anti-bullying-prompts-expansion-173049219.html">proactive</a> in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-tests-safety-mode-164638754.html">preventing</a> them from going through. In the future, those tools could include a feature that lets you filter potentially offensive replies and another that lets you limit potentially unwelcome accounts from replying. Twitter Senior Product Designer Paula Barcante has <a href="https://twitter.com/paulabarcante/status/1441457192712818692">released</a> a sneak peek of the features, which are merely concepts at the moment, to seek input from users.</p><p>Barcante says Twitter will ask you if you&#39;d like to switch on those controls if it detects potentially harmful replies to your tweets.

That&#39;s why the company is also exploring the possibility of giving you the option to review filtered tweets and limited accounts. Of course, the final iterations of the tools might look vastly different from these previews if they do get released.&nbsp;</p><p>When asked if toggling on the reply filter would filter out all tweets from an account or just the tweet the website has deemed potentially offensive, Barcante didn&#39;t have an answer yet. She said what she showed was just an &quot;early concept that requires testing and iteration&quot; and that Twitter will provide more details if it decides to launch the tools.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitterconcepts-filtering-limiting-replies-054221017.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c913d7ed-a2e8-4f1c-93e1-efd3d9ac12e2</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 25 Sep 2021 05:42:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632548568</ingested><modified>2021-09-25T05:42:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/13f87240-1db8-11ec-b9f7-7984d1243909" width="1600" height="1019" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/13f87240-1db8-11ec-b9f7-7984d1243909" width="1600" height="1019" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Twitter]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Twitter]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Twitter]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[iPhone 13 Pro's 120Hz display limits some third-party app animations to 60Hz (updated)]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With this year’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-review-120-hz-promotion-screen-macro-camera-cinematic-mode-samples-battery-life-143041678.html">iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max</a>, Apple finally brought its ProMotion display technology from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-12-apple-ipad-pro-10-5-review.html">iPad Pro</a> over to some of its phones.

Some of the ones you can use currently include &quot;entertainment,&quot; &quot;world news&quot; and &quot;gaming.&quot;</p><div id="39e390c042ca4ac18e80698743116c86"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">new in Spaces: Topics!<br><br>when creating or scheduling a Space, some of you on Android can choose up to 3 Topics to tag it with from a list of our top 10 Topics.

The viewing package is probably on the move and the league has reportedly picked its preferred new home for Sunday Ticket: Apple.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t seem likely that DirecTV, which has been one of the NFL&#39;s main TV partners for nearly three decades, will renew its deal. The NFL is looking for north of $2 billion per year for Sunday Ticket rights, according to <a href="https://theathletic.com/news/nfl-prefers-apple-as-new-sunday-ticket-provider-sources/TJgzheClMwpc"><em><ins>The Athletic</ins></em></a>, which is at least $500 million more than the satellite company is currently paying the league.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>DirecTV has long been losing money on the package. It needs 5 million Sunday Ticket subscribers to cover the current fees, though <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/10/amazon-likely-front-runner-for-multi-year-nfl-sunday-ticket-deal-sources.html"><em><ins>CNBC</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>reported the figure has been closer to 2 million on average. Combined with a sense that the NFL is diluting Sunday Ticket&#39;s value by shifting more games to other days, that doesn&#39;t exactly make reupping the deal an attractive proposition for DirecTV and parent company AT&amp;T.</p><p>As such, potential suitors with deeper pockets appear to be stepping up. Apple, Disney/ESPN and Amazon, which will start <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-thursday-night-football-2022-season-184224274.html"><ins>streaming Thursday Night Football games</ins></a> on Prime Video next season, are among those who have reportedly shown interest.</p><p>It&#39;ll likely be several months before the Sunday Ticket bidding process is over, but Apple looks like the frontrunner. <em>The Athletic</em> reports that Apple is considering offering games on a more ad-hoc basis. It could let fans buy their own team&#39;s out-of-market games or even shell out for standalone games.</p><p>One factor in Amazon&#39;s favor is it has more experience than Apple when it comes to live sports.
