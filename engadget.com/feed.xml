Steve Dent and a licensed drone pilot toured the French countryside with the help of the DJI Mavic 3 drone, while Terrence O’Brien played with the Animoog Z app, a sequel ten years in the making. Also, Cherlynn Low played around with Android 12 to check out its new Material You design.</p><h2>The Mavic 3 is the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dji-mavic-3-drone-review-cinematic-power-at-a-price-150029600.html">easiest DJI drone to fly</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/792be770-5475-11ec-84ff-19101d72dfea" alt="DJI Mavic 3" data-uuid="d1d4c64d-89d1-34e1-8d26-548eaf071023"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>Steve Dent spent some time with the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:DJI Mavic 3" href="https://fave.co/3IlHZXa">DJI Mavic 3</a> and a licensed drone pilot in the French countryside to see what the new device is capable of. He reports that not only is the Mavic 3 the easiest DJI drone to fly, but the large 4/3 sensor and dual camera system produce incredible footage – and the 46 minutes of range is double the time that the previous model could capture. He tested the standard model in the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$3,000 Fly More combo package" href="https://fave.co/3xRgHDm">$3,000 Fly More combo package</a>, which includes three batteries, a charging hub, one set of ND filters and a carrying bag. The Mavic 3 is also available in a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Cine mode" href="https://fave.co/3IudRcz">Cine mode</a> with a built-in 1TB SSD and Apple ProRes 422 HQ video support.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the Mavic 3 was easier to maneuver thanks to its improved obstacle avoidance, it was also easy to fold the 899-gram drone into a more compact size for storage and travel. Steve says the camera and video specs are impressive: the primary camera was built in collaboration with Hasselblad and has a 24mm f/2.8-f/11 lens with a color profile for accurate hues. The video camera can shoot 5.1K at 50fps or 4K at 60fps; Steve says the larger sensor provides better low light performance, more detail and great dynamic range. However, there are some downsides – namely the price, but also that the additional features that DJI promised (like ActiveTrack5 and QuickShots) aren&#39;t available now but will be released in January. Overall, Steve says the Mavic 3 delivers, but is best for professions and prosumers.</p><h2>Google’s Material You design gives Android 12 a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-review-material-you-privacy-controls-180010087.html">much-needed visual update</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/175165c0-5475-11ec-b3e6-937a05f6bfec" alt="Android 12" data-uuid="51bb46ca-3f29-39fe-ae68-c9c126372361"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Cherlynn Low knows that the many versions of Android make a review of the core features a bit difficult, but the upgrades on the operating system’s most recent release make for a refreshing experience and provide more transparency over data and privacy. That’s largely thanks to the new Material You design that has decluttered the UI and enlarged buttons and sliders, among other things. Cherlynn particularly liked the Privacy Dashboard that informs users when their camera and mic are activated, along with which apps require them. Android 12 also has new indicators for when the camera or mic are actively being used.</p><p>Cherlynn did note some aspects that disappointed her, namely the default way to summon the Google Assistant, and the confusing charts and graphs in the battery and privacy dashboards. She was also excited to try the audio-coupled haptic feedback, but wasn’t able to find any apps that supported it. Overall, she said that the visual updates in Material You and increased privacy tools made the system feel drastically different — in a good way.</p><h2>The Animoog Z app is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/moog-animoog-z-i-os-softsynth-music-app-170019893.html">a proper sequel that took ten years to make</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ced04d20-5474-11ec-affb-662506c56596" alt="Moog Animoog Z" data-uuid="b4d70e70-8332-3705-8173-22918befe6fe"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien/Engadget</div></figure><p>Terrence O’Brien was looking forward to testing out <a href="https://www.moogmusic.com/products/animoog-z">Animoog Z</a>, the follow up to Moog’s original software instrument which used wavetable synthesis. This sequel to the app has largely the same core Anisotropic Synth Engine, consisting of dozens of waveforms that you can choose from, ranging from samples of analog saw waves to more digital sounds. However, the new release adds a third dimension to the X/Y axis of the original — a Z axis that notes can move along.</p><p>Terrence says this gives the new app a bit more depth and room to evolve. He found that certain presets took advantage of the additional modulation path to make more complex and unique sounds. There’s also a new effects section with a looper, delay, filter and an arpeggiator, plus MPE support. Additionally, Terrence says the redesigned look that the new app has makes it feel more modern and easier to navigate. After testing, he declared the Animoog Z a worthy successor to the groundbreaking original. A limited version is available as a free download, with the full featured version going for a flat $10.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/icymi-we-check-out-android-12s-visual-refresh-170059195.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">666717d6-70f3-4172-8c42-33499bdd3325</guid><dc:creator>Amber Bouman</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 17:00:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638564138</ingested><modified>2021-12-03T20:42:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Amber Bouman]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9f9e2680-4bd2-11ec-9dfd-844877790d9b" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9f9e2680-4bd2-11ec-9dfd-844877790d9b" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A phone showing the Android 12 easter egg, which is the OS logo on a background of circles themed to the system's color scheme.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Android 12]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[NASA will give SpaceX more crewed flights to cover for Boeing's delays]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Boeing&#39;s continued <a href="https://www.engadget.com/boeing-starliner-test-flight-delayed-2022-164715835.html">Starliner delays</a> have prompted NASA to hedge its bets. <em>SpaceNews</em><a href="https://spacenews.com/nasa-to-award-spacex-three-more-commercial-crew-flights/">reports</a> NASA <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/commercialcrew/2021/12/03/nasa-to-secure-additional-commercial-crew-transportation/">plans to order</a> as many as three more crewed SpaceX flights to ensure &quot;uninterrupted&quot; US trips to the International Space Station as soon as 2023. The company&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/watch-spacex-crew-3-livestream-213038925.html">Crew Dragon</a> is the only system that meets  partner country and safety requirements in the necessary time window, the agency said.

Officials also stressed that the deal didn&#39;t prevent NASA from changing the contract to obtain additional flights.</p><p>Even so, the intended purchase is a blow for Boeing. Starliner plays a key role in Boeing&#39;s commercial spaceflight program and, unofficially, serves as proof the transportation veteran can compete with a fast-moving &#39;newcomer&#39; like SpaceX in the private space race. The Crew Dragon backup plans reflect some lost confidence in Boeing, even if the move is only temporary.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nasa-adds-spacex-flights-due-to-boeing-starliner-delay-164503658.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f09239ec-fe74-4d21-a967-00cd2d5bab29</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 16:45:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638636308</ingested><modified>2021-12-04T16:45:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Industrials]]></category><category><![CDATA[Airline Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3f5ce2e0-551c-11ec-af7f-b57f4be9373e" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3f5ce2e0-551c-11ec-af7f-b57f4be9373e" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SpaceX, Flickr]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule on return from Crew-2 mission]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule on return from Crew-2 mission]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hitting the Books: How the interplay of science and technology brought about iPhones]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Scientific research and technological advancement have gone hand-in-hand since the invention of the wheel.

These patterns can be thought of as questions: Why does a particular pattern occur? Why when one releases a ball does the ball fall and fall faster the farther it has fallen? Explanations of those raw patterns come a level below in the hierarchy, and can be thought of as answers to those questions: Galileo’s sixteenth-century explanation of the observed distance-versus-time pattern was that the velocities of falling balls increase linearly with time. But this answer, or explanation, becomes itself another question: Why do the velocities of falling balls increase linearly with time? This question begs a deeper explanation, a deeper answer: Newton’s explanation was that gravity is a force, that uniform forces cause uniform acceleration, and that uniform acceleration causes linear increases in velocity. Scientific understanding is always incomplete, of course, so there is always a point at which we have no deeper explanation. This in no way detracts from the power of the explanations that do exist: science seeks proximate whys but does not insist on ultimate whys. The general theory of relativity explains Newton’s laws of gravity, even if its own origin is yet to be explained.</p><p>In technology, at the top of the hierarchy are human-desired functions. These functions present problems that are solved by forms below them in the hierarchy. Forms fulfill functions, but those forms present new problems that must be solved at successively deeper levels. Shifting from the problem-solution nomenclature to the equivalent question-answer nomenclature, we can say that the iPhone represented a technological question: How do we create an Internet-capable cellular phone with a software-programmable interactive display? A partial answer came in the form of multi touch capacitive surfaces, opening up a significant design space for user interaction when multiple fingers are used simultaneously. But the opaqueness of existing multitouch surfaces itself became a question: How do we make multi touch surfaces transparent so that the display is visible? The multi touch transparent surface display provided an answer.</p><p>In other words, science and technology are both organized into hierarchies of question-and-answer pairs, with any question or answer having two “faces.” One face, pointing downward in the hierarchy, represents a question to an answer just below it in the hierarchy. The other face, pointing upward in the hierarchy, represents an answer to a question just above it in the hierarchy. We emphasize that our depiction of questions as “above” answers and answers as “below” questions is arbitrary — it does not signify relative importance or value but is simply intended to be consistent with common usage. In science, an explanation is deeper and more “foundational” than the fact it explains, especially if it generalizes to explanations of many other facts. Special relativity is, in that sense, deeper than the constancy of c because it answers the question of why c is constant; it also answers the question of how much energy is released during nuclear fission and fusion. In technology, forms are deeper and more “foundational” than the functions they fulfill, especially if they have been adapted to fulfill many other functions. The multi touch transparent surface display is more foundational than the iPhone because it not only helps answer the question of how to create the iPhone, but also helps answer the question of how to create human-interactive displays in general. Rubber is more foundational than a bicycle tire because it not only helps answer the question of how to create a bicycle tire, but also helps answer the question of how to create a myriad of other kinds of tires.</p><h3>The Network Is Modular: Facilitating Exploitation and Exploration</h3><p>Closely related scientific questions and answers are organized into what we might call scientific domains, which we will refer to as scientific knowledge modules. Closely interacting technological problems and solutions are organized into engineered components, which we will refer to as technological knowledge modules.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/038d8cb0-545e-11ec-b0af-f970a83638da" style="height:463;width:735;" alt="fig 2-2" data-uuid="c9083205-5dc8-3e86-a418-93e62299de7a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Harvard University Press</div></figure><p>Closely related scientific questions are often answerable within a scientific knowledge domain, or scientific knowledge module, drawing on multiple subdomains nested within the larger domain. A question related to some electron transport phenomenon in a particular semiconductor structure lies in the broad domain of semiconductor science but the answer might require an integrated understanding of both the subdomain of electron transport physics as well as the subdomain of the materials science of the synthesized structure. The subquestion associated with electron transport physics might require an integrated understanding of the subdomain of electrons in various kinds of structures (bulk materials, heterojunctions, nanostructures, coupled nanostructures) and of the sub-subdomains of interactions of electrons with phonons in those structures. The subquestion associated with the materials science of the synthesized structure might require an understanding of the sub-subdomains of substrates and epitaxy, thin films, or post materials synthesis fabrication. In other words, we can think of scientific knowledge domains as a modular hierarchy, and think of its subdomains as submodules and sub-submodules.</p><p>Closely related technological problems, likewise, are often solved by key technological components, or technological knowledge modules, perhaps integrating multiple subcomponents nested within the larger components. An iPhone is a component itself composed of many subcomponents, and each subcomponent is similarly subdivided. We can think of the “problem” of the iPhone as a component that is “solved” by its subcomponents — an enclosure, a display, a printed circuit board, a camera, and input / output ports. We can think of the “problem” of a printed circuit board as a subcomponent that is “solved” by sub-components that include low-power integrated circuit chips. Conversely, an iPhone is also a component that is itself nested in a hierarchy of use functions. An iPhone might be used as a solution to the problem of “running” a text-messaging app; a text-messaging app might be used as a solution to the problem of sending a mass text message to a friend group; the mass text message might be used as a solution to the problem of organizing the friend group into a protest in Times Square; and the protest in Times Square might be part of a solution to the problem of organizing a wider social movement for some human-desired social cause.</p><p>One might ask: Why is scientific and technological knowledge modular? They are modular because they are complex adaptive systems — systems sustained by and adapted to their environment by complex internal changes — and virtually all complex adaptive systems are modular (Simon, 1962). Complex adaptive systems both exploit their environments and explore their environments to improve that exploitation. Modularity enables efficiency, both in the exploitation of existing knowledge about the environment and exploration of that environment to create new knowledge.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-genesis-of-technoscientific-revolutions-narayanmurti-tsao-harvard-press-163025911.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8fcee4b1-e8d0-4f63-b108-17c5b1e039e5</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 16:30:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638553332</ingested><modified>2021-12-03T17:42:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Career & Education]]></category><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/20f16f90-5460-11ec-8f31-64a31fc82b7c" width="5316" height="3534" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/20f16f90-5460-11ec-8f31-64a31fc82b7c" width="5316" height="3534" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Justin Sullivan via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA - SEPTEMBER 10: Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller talks about the new iPhone 11 Pro during a special event on September 10, 2019 in the Steve Jobs Theater on Apple's Cupertino, California campus.

In the wake of a <em>Washington Post</em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/12/03/game-awards-announcements/">report</a> raising questions about Activision Blizzard&#39;s involvement at the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/game-awards-nominees-2021-180501577.html">2021 Game Awards</a>, producer Geoff Keighley <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1467007741214347264">confirmed</a> the publisher wouldn&#39;t have a role at the show outside of the nominations chosen by influencers and media. There&#39;s &quot;no place&quot; for abuse and harassment anywhere, Keighley <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1467008291582537732">said</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;He <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1467008292660527105">added</a> that the industry needed to &quot;work together&quot; to create a more inclusive space for developing games. The focus was on celebrating games and the people who made them, <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1467008293860429825">according</a> to the founder. Keighley already said <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blizzard-delays-overwatch-2-diablo-4-212039519.html"><em>Diablo IV</em> and <em>Overwatch 2</em></a> wouldn&#39;t appear during the presentation.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s not clear if the scandal had a direct impact on Activision&#39;s presence, but it&#39;s a contrast from 2020. Then, the company used the Game Awards to show <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War</em>&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/call-of-duty-s1-warzone-modern-warfare-115815647.html">first season</a> of battle royale material.</p><p>Questions remain, though. Most notably, the awards&#39; advisory panel includes Activision Blizzard president Rob Kostich. The publisher still technically holds some sway over the event, even if it didn&#39;t dictate much of the show in practice. Keighley told the <em>Post</em> the show organizers had to &quot;think very carefully&quot; about how to move forward — much <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-phil-spencer-activision-blizzard-203557204.html">like Microsoft</a> and other industry partners, the Game Awards team hasn&#39;t yet decided on the long-term repercussions (if any) for Activision&#39;s problematic workplace culture.</p><div id="1671363322cc483aabe98263da373c06"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheGameAwards?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TheGameAwards</a> is a time of celebration for this industry, the biggest form of entertainment in the world.<br><br>There is no place for abuse, harassment or predatory practices in any company or any community.</p>— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1467008291582537732?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-absent-at-2021-game-awards-151558841.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e71c0698-9289-4fa6-aa6b-5dc85a749cb9</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 15:15:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638630962</ingested><modified>2021-12-04T15:16:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Finance Trading]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/b70e9f00-550c-11ec-b87f-da545b99f509" width="4095" height="2730" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/b70e9f00-550c-11ec-b87f-da545b99f509" width="4095" height="2730" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[JC Olivera via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - DECEMBER 12:  Geoff Keighley speaks  onstage during The Game Awards 2019 at Microsoft Theater on December 12, 2019 in Los Angeles, California.

We saw a bunch go on sale for Black Friday, but now Wellbots is having a sale on one of Roomba&#39;s most advanced models. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Roomba s9+" href="https://fave.co/3e1JhZm">Roomba s9+</a> is $200 off right now when you use the code <strong>ENGADGET200</strong> at checkout, so you&#39;ll end up paying $899 for the machine — that&#39;s the best price we&#39;ve seen it and even cheaper than it was last month during Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3e1JhZm" id="dc1aea0b3953401b946029fd82d9c642" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Wellbots;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Roomba s9+ at Wellbots - $899</a><p>The s9+ is even more advanced than the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/irobot-roomba-j-7-object-poop-detection-040152887.html">new Roomba j7+</a> that came out recently, although it does not have Precision Vision Navigation like the latter. Instead, the S9+ has the most suction power of any Roomba along with dual multi-surface brushes and Direct Detect technology, the latter of which helps the vacuum focus on the dirtiest spots in your home until they&#39;re fully clean. &quot;Power-lift suction&quot; also helps it deep clean carpets and suck up pet hair. It has sensors to help it move around objects like chairs and tablets and, thanks to its mapping technology, you can have it clean only certain rooms or areas of your home if you wish.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This model also has the clean base that comes with other more expensive Roombas. After each job, the s9+ will automatically return to its base for a recharge, and it will empty its bin into the clean base, which is basically an attached garbage can. That means you don&#39;t have to fuss with the vacuum every time you run it, and you&#39;ll only have to empty the clean base once every 60 days. That combined with the robot&#39;s easy-to-use companion app makes it a premium convenience machine — if you use iRobot&#39;s mobile app to start or schedule cleanings, you may not even have to touch the s9+ for weeks at a time while it does its job.</p><p>Even on sale, the Roomba s9+ is a big purchase — but it may be worth it for those who hate vacuuming and want their homes to be as clean as possible without having to do much themselves. There are plenty of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html">budget options</a>, though, if you&#39;d rather save a good chunk of money and still get the benefits of a robot vacuum. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Roomba 694" href="https://amzn.to/3EuUai0">Roomba 694</a> is a good option, as well as the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Anker RoboVac 11S" href="https://amzn.to/3ogWvaP">Anker RoboVac 11S</a>. The former can be controlled via a mobile app while the latter comes with a remote that lets you maneuver the vacuum like a toy car in addition to setting schedules and the like.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/irobots-roomba-s9-plus-vacuum-with-clean-base-is-200-off-right-now-150049330.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2debba16-749f-4ea9-8e66-f7b10c2311e3</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 15:00:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638475947</ingested><modified>2021-12-02T20:12:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/03538f70-3591-11eb-9f3b-ab8c466c220a" width="1600" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/03538f70-3591-11eb-9f3b-ab8c466c220a" width="1600" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iRobot&#39;s Roomba s9+ vacuum with clean base is $200 off right now]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tour the White House's Christmas decorations on Google Street View]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You can now take a tour of the White House&#39;s halls decked with Christmas trees and other decor fit for the season — virtually, that is.

What you won’t find inside the box is a power adapter or USB cable. It’s up to you to supply those, so it’s not quite as affordable as its price would suggest.

In the meantime, if you’re desperate to find a way to charge your devices on the go, your best bet is to buy a portable power bank. You can find ones that cost less than $20. What’s more, they will feature a bigger battery than the Nordmärke and they will charge your devices faster.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ikea-nordmarke-qi-charger-leak-203043188.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2889294c-c048-4b34-a1b7-62eecb3b928a</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 20:30:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638567149</ingested><modified>2021-12-03T21:32:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/6fc45e50-5480-11ec-99de-7614988bf1da" width="1344" height="907" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/6fc45e50-5480-11ec-99de-7614988bf1da" width="1344" height="907" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[BananimusPrime]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[IKEA Nordmärke portable Qi charger]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[IKEA Nordmärke portable Qi charger ]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[New Twitter CEO has already begun a 'major reorganization']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following founder <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-jack-dorsey-ceo-step-down-150532889.html">Jack Dorsey&#39;s recent departure on Monday</a>, Twitter&#39;s new CEO Parag Agrawal is wasting no time shaking up the company.

A spokesperson said &quot;Parag is focused on operational excellence and setting Twitter up to hit its goals; these changes were made with that in mind.&quot; The changes include moving to a &quot;General Manager model&quot; for teams in the product and technology organizations, which will mean having one person lead the work in those divisions. &quot;This will allow us to operate more cross-functionally and enable faster, more informed decision-making,&quot; the spokesperson added.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Davis earlier today <a href="https://twitter.com/dantley/status/1466636819383025666">tweeted </a>a picture from a team offsite, saying: &quot;It was the highlight of the past two years at Twitter for me.

The State Department also declined to comment on the report.

But in the case of the State Department employees deployed to Uganda, they were reportedly using iPhones with local telephone numbers. They were also hacked before Apple <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/13/technology/apple-software-update-spyware-nso-group.html"><ins>released iOS 14.8</ins></a>, which addressed the CoreGraphics vulnerability NSO had exploited to allow its spyware to infect an iPhone without the victim even needing to <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/09/forcedentry-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit-captured-in-the-wild/"><ins>tap on anything</ins></a>.

The company is planning to merge <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/playstation%20plus/">PlayStation Plus</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/playstation%20now/">PlayStation Now</a> into a new offering, which is expected to debut this spring, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-03/playstation-plans-new-service-to-take-on-xbox-game-pass"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>.</p><p>The service, which is codenamed Spartacus, would likely be available on PS4 and PS5 for a monthly fee. It&#39;s unclear whether players would be able to access it on other devices, though the report notes Sony is putting more resources into cloud gaming. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate allows players to delve into more than 100 Xbox titles via the cloud on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-beta-180329068.html"><ins>consoles</ins></a>, PC, phones and tablets. Microsoft plans to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-cloud-streaming-hardware-game-pass-e3-2021-130019814.html"><ins>make game streaming sticks</ins></a> for TVs too.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It seems Sony will kill off PlayStation Now, but keep the PlayStation Plus branding. Sony may not yet have finalized how Spartacus will work, but there could be three tiers to the service. According to documents viewed by <em>Bloomberg</em>, the lowest tier would effectively be PlayStation Plus as it is now. The second level would add a &quot;large catalog&quot; of PS4 titles, with PS5 games joining later. The third and highest tier would include cloud gaming, expanded demos and, akin to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-pricing-animal-crossing-dlc-143755599.html"><ins>Nintendo Switch Online</ins></a>, a bunch of older PS1, PS2, PS3 and even PSP games. However, those plans may not be set in stone.</p><p>It&#39;s not clear whether Sony plans to bring its first-party exclusives to the service on their release date, as Microsoft does on Game Pass. Sony Interactive Entertainment president and CEO Jim Ryan <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-09-17-playstations-jim-ryan-we-want-to-give-gamers-certainty-that-theyre-buying-a-true-next-generation-console"><ins>said last year</ins></a> that the company wouldn&#39;t &quot;go down the road of putting new release titles into a subscription model. These games cost many millions of dollars, well over $100 million, to develop. We just don&#39;t see that as sustainable.&quot;</p><p>But the landscape has shifted since Ryan&#39;s remarks. For one thing, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-bethesda-microsoft-zenimax-media-deal-completed-151544647.html">Microsoft bought Bethesda parent company ZeniMax Media</a> this year. All of Bethesda&#39;s games (save for a couple of timed PS5 console exclusives like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Deathloop/"><em><ins>Deathloop</ins></em></a>) are on Game Pass, and future Bethesda titles like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/starfield/"><em><ins>Starfield</ins></em></a> might not come to PlayStation at all.</p><p>Although Game Pass would likely be Sony&#39;s biggest competitor in the game subscription market, it&#39;ll be up against several other major companies. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ea%20play/"><ins>EA</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-game-streaming-amazon-luna-google-stadia-160227004.html"><ins>Ubisoft</ins></a> have subscription services, Amazon launched <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/amazon%20luna/"><ins>Luna</ins></a> last year and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-games-iphone-ipad-ios-182421405.html"><ins>Netflix added games</ins></a> to its existing plans. As for cloud gaming (a category Luna also falls into), there&#39;s NVIDIA&#39;s GeForce Now and Google Stadia, and even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-cloud-gaming-platform-smart-tv-155226529.html"><ins>Samsung has cloud gaming ambitions</ins></a>.</p><p>PlayStation Now was one of the earliest major game subscription services when it debuted in 2015, but it had a fairly tepid response. Players were only able to access PS Now games via the cloud until 2018, when they were able to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-20-playstation-now-ps4-ps2-game-downloads.html"><ins>download some PS4 and PS2 titles</ins></a> to their console.</p><p>One of the biggest complaints we had about the service when <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-18-playstation-now-re-review.html"><ins>we reviewed it again in 2019</ins></a> was the lack of notable games. Since then, Sony has brought some big games like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-playstation-now-fallout-76-final-fantasy-163716243.html"><em><ins>The Last of Us Part II</ins></em><ins> to PS Now</ins></a> for a limited time.</p><p>By the end of Sony&#39;s 2020 financial year, there were <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/irday/pdf/2021/GNS_E.pdf"><ins>only 3.2 million PS Now subscribers</ins></a>. Microsoft <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/xbox-game-pass-subscriber-growth-missed-microsofts-annual-target/"><ins>announced</ins></a> in January that it had 18 million Game Pass members. For that reason and many others, it&#39;s a smart idea for Sony to go back to the drawing board and create a more robust subscription service.&nbsp;</p><p>Much like Microsoft, Sony has started looking beyond PlayStation consoles to bring its games to new audiences. Over the last year or so, it released <a href="https://www.engadget.com/horizon-zero-dawn-pc-release-date-000029472.html"><em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/days-gone-pc-release-date-steam-epic-games-store-trailer-140746800.html"><em>Days Gone</em></a> on PC. A bundle of <em>Uncharted 4 </em>and <em>Uncharted: The Lost Legacy</em> is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uncharted-4-and-uncharted-lost-legacy-are-coming-to-ps-5-and-pc-211007741.html">coming to PC in early 2022</a>, as is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-god-of-war-pc-january-14-153911186.html">the 2018 reboot of <em>God of War</em></a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-xbox-game-pass-subscription-sparatcus-175650996.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">06679f6d-8491-4265-8efe-92f5568e7eaa</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 17:56:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638556254</ingested><modified>2021-12-03T18:31:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/f98906f0-4949-11ec-bc73-6ed9978e7b04" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/f98906f0-4949-11ec-bc73-6ed9978e7b04" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Aaron Souppouris/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[PlayStation 5 and DualSense controller]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[PlayStation 5 and DualSense controller]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's Kindle is on sale for $55 with three months of Kindle Unlimited]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you missed Amazon&#39;s standard e-reader when it was on sale for $50 on Black Friday, you have another shot to grab it for less.

It may be a bit more expensive than it was one week ago, but the added bonus of Kindle Unlimited sweetens the deal a bit — and you&#39;re still getting the device for $35 less than usual.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3EgIzmN" id="988fe6a23bd6473baba378be7f54984e" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Kindle at Amazon - $55</a><p>Amazon updated the Kindle in 2019 and we gave it a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-10-amazon-kindle-review-2019.html">score of 91</a> when we reviewed the e-reader. The base model gave the previous-generation Paperwhite a run for its money thanks to its new front-lit display with better contrast and its smaller, sleeker design. It also comes with 8GB of storage, which is plenty of space to hold thousands of titles.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The differences between the standard Kindle and the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:new Kindle Paperwhite" href="https://amzn.to/31kd8tq">new Kindle Paperwhite</a> will be more apparent, and they should be considering the latter costs $140. The new Paperwhite&#39;s 300ppi screen is slightly larger and 10 percent brighter, and page-turning is said to be about 20 percent faster. The higher-end model also has Audible support, so you can listen to audiobooks when you have a pair of Bluetooth headphones connected, and it&#39;s water-resistant as well.</p><p>If you can live without those extra perks, it&#39;s hard to beat the standard Kindle when it&#39;s on sale like this. It would make a good stocking stuffer for the book-lover in your life, or a convenient gadget if you plan on trying to read more in the new year. And with Kindle Unlimited for a couple of months, you&#39;ll get access to thousands of titles to read at your leisure at no extra cost. Just remember that the subscription will renew at the standard $10-per-month rate after the first three months are up.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazons-kindle-is-on-sale-for-55-with-three-months-of-kindle-unlimited-173203718.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e6f83312-ac9a-4863-a494-cffed7db6f17</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 17:32:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638552725</ingested><modified>2021-12-03T17:32:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/9d4f5640-b233-11ea-bfe7-2b4eac12b399" width="1800" height="1127" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/9d4f5640-b233-11ea-bfe7-2b4eac12b399" width="1800" height="1127" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Kindle]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Kindle]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bird expands its electric wheelchair and mobility scooter rentals to San Diego]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/bird/">Bird</a> is bringing its electric wheelchairs and mobility scooters to more cities.

Bidding on the non-fungible token will start at $100, though we expect it will take <a href="https://www.engadget.com/edward-snowden-nft-sold-for-55-million-080508241.html"><ins>several million</ins></a> to secure it before the auction ends on December 15th.

Once the auction is complete, the NFT will grant its new owner control of a single webpage. Just like Wikipedia as it exists today, anyone can edit that webpage to change what it says. However, after five minutes, it will revert to its original state, with a single entry stating, “Hello, World!”</p><p>“What you see displayed is what Wikipedia looked like at the moment that I set up the software,” Wales said. “The artistic concept is to take people back to that moment when I set up the website and had to think, ‘Gosh, this is so vulnerable. Like anybody can edit. It might just destroy the whole thing, and I’ll be taken over by trolls in five minutes.’”</p><p>The NFT will give its eventual owner the ability to change the editing window. They’ll also have the option to turn off editing and, if they’re really dull, the power to shut down the webpage. “With everything on Wikipedia, it’s freely licensed,” Wales said of the project. “So if you want to do anything, you pretty much can.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/jimmy-wales-wikipedia-nft-auction-171330170.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">400bef23-5d64-4e28-ae69-c5829e1f8e28</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 17:13:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638551647</ingested><modified>2021-12-03T17:14:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/48aa7310-545b-11ec-bb7a-908f96b77dab" width="5729" height="3830" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/48aa7310-545b-11ec-bb7a-908f96b77dab" width="5729" height="3830" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Charles Platiau / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales, attends the Viva Tech start-up and technology summit in Paris, France, May 24, 2018.

Lastly, Twitter says it removed two batches of accounts connected to Russia — 16 that promoted a pro-Russia perspective in the Central African Republic, and 50 that criticized the civic Libyan government and promoted Russia’s geopolitical position there and in Syria.</p><p>Since it started disclosing its efforts against state-linked manipulation campaigns three years ago, Twitter says it has removed more than 200 million tweets and nine terabytes of media connected to them.

The <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/">Irish Council for Civil Liberties</a> (ICCL), says that Europe’s data protection regulators will soon declare the current regime illegal. At the heart of this complaint is both how the industry asks for permission, and then how it serves adverts to users online. Describing the situation as the “world’s biggest data breach,” the consequences of the ruling could have staggering ramifications for everything that we do online.</p><h3>“The world’s biggest data breach”</h3><p>Real-Time Bidding (RTB) is the mechanism by which most online ads are served to you today, and lies at the heart of the issue. Visit a website and, these days, you will notice a split-second delay between the content loading, and the adverts that surround it. You may be reading a line in an article, only for the text to suddenly leap halfway down the page, as a new advert takes its place in front of your eyes. This delay, however small, accommodates a labyrinthine process in which countless companies bid to put their advert in front of your eyes. Omri Kedem, from digital marketing agency <a href="https://croud.com/en-gb/">Croud</a>, explained that the whole process takes less than 100 milliseconds from start to finish.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Advertising is the lifeblood of the internet, providing social media platforms and news organisations with a way to make money. Advertisers feel more confident paying for ads, however, if they can be reasonably certain that the person on the other end is inside the target market. But, in order to make sure that this works, the platform hosting the ad needs to know everything it can about you, the user.</p><p>This is how, say, a sneaker store is able to market its wares to the local sneakerheads or a vegan restaurant looks for vegans and vegetarians in its local area. Companies like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-facebook-removes-sensitive-topic-ad-targeting-222436773.html">Facebook</a> have made huge profits on their ability to laser-focus ad campaigns on behalf of advertisers. But this process has a dark side, and this micro-targeting can, for instance, be used to enable hateful conduct. The most notable example is from 2017, when <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-enabled-advertisers-to-reach-jew-haters"><em>ProPublica</em></a> found that you could target a cohort of users deemed anti-semitic with the tag “Jew Hater.”</p><p>Every time you visit a website, a number of facts about you are broadcast to the site’s owner including your IP address. But that data can also include your exact longitude and latitude (if you have built-in GPS), your carrier and device type. Visit a news website every day and it’s likely that both the publisher and ad-tech intermediary will track which sections you spend more time reading.</p><div id="bee70a6895a14c2481680214770623bd"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You can download Mobilewalla and Ubermedia&#39;s data directories from the evidence we sent the DPC 13+ months ago here <a href="https://t.co/3ccOMbNyNC">https://t.co/3ccOMbNyNC</a>. Note: this is clearly the IAB standard. <a href="https://t.co/aSHP3NzQgE">pic.twitter.com/aSHP3NzQgE</a></p>— Johnny Ryan (@johnnyryan) <a href="https://twitter.com/johnnyryan/status/1461342714247598087?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>This information can be combined with material you’ve willingly submitted to a publisher when asked. Subscribe to a publication like the <em>Financial Times</em> or <em>Forbes</em>, for instance, and you’ll be asked about your job title and industry. From there, publishers can make clear assumptions about your annual income, social class and political interests. Combine this information — known in the industry as <a href="https://searchdatamanagement.techtarget.com/definition/deterministic-probabilistic-data#:~:text=Deterministic%20data%2C%20also%20referred%20to,one%20user%20to%20one%20dataset.&amp;text=Probabilistic%20data%20is%20information%20that,likelihood%20of%20a%20certain%20outcome.">deterministic data</a> — with the inferences made based on your browsing history — known as probabilistic data — and you can build a fairly extensive profile of a user.</p><p>“The more bidders you have on something you’re trying to sell, in theory, the better,” says Dr. Johnny Ryan. Ryan is a Senior Fellow at the ICCL with a specialism in Information Rights and has been leading the charge against Real-Time Bidding for years. In order to make tracking-based advertising work, the publisher and ad intermediary will compress your life into a series of codes: Bidstream Data. Ryan says that this is a list of “identification codes [which] are highly unique to you,” and is passed on to a number of auction sites.</p><p>“The most obvious identification is the app that you’re using, which can be very compromising indeed, or the specific URL that you’re visiting,” says Ryan. He added that the URL of the site, which can be included in this information, can be “excruciatingly embarrassing” if seen by a third party. If you’re looking up information about a health condition or material related to your sexuality and sexual preferences, this can also be added to the data. And there’s no easy and clean way to edit or redact this data as it is broadcast to countless ad exchanges.</p><p>In order to harmonize this data, the Interactive Advertising Bureau, the online ad industry’s trade body, produces a standard taxonomy. (The IAB, as it is known, has a standalone body operating in Europe, while the taxonomy itself is produced by a New York-based Tech Lab.) The <a href="https://iabtechlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IABTL-Audience-Taxonomy-1.0-5.16.19-Final.xlsx">IAB Audience Taxonomy</a> (subsequently revised to version 1.1) will codify you, for instance, as being into Arts and Crafts (Code 1472) or Birdwatching (435). Alternatively, it can tag you as  having an interest in Islam (602), Substance Abuse (568) or if you have a child with special educational needs (357).&nbsp;</p><p>But not every bidder in those auctions is looking to place an ad, and some are much more interested in the data that is being shared. A <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93ypke/the-nsa-and-cia-use-ad-blockers-because-online-advertising-is-so-dangerous"><em>Motherboard</em></a> story from earlier this year revealed that the United States Intelligence Community mandates the use of ad-blockers to prevent RTB agencies from identifying serving personnel, data which could wind up in the hands of <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/88aw73/congress-foreign-intelligence-agencies-bidstream-real-time-bidding">rival nations</a>. Earlier versions of <a href="https://iabtechlab.com/standards/content-taxonomy/">IAB&#39;s <em>Content</em> Taxonomy</a> even included tags identifying a user as potentially working for the US military.</p><p>It’s this specificity in the data, coupled with the fact that it can be shared widely and so regularly, that has prompted Ryan to call this the “world’s biggest data breach.” He cited an example of a French firm, Vectuary, which was <a href="https://brave.com/cnil-consent-rtb/">investigated</a> in 2018 by France’s data protection regulator, CNIL. What officials found was data listings for almost 68 million people, much of which had been gathered using captured RTB data. At the time, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/20/how-a-small-french-privacy-ruling-could-remake-adtech-for-good/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> reported that the Vectaury case could have ramifications for the advertising market and its use of consent banners.</p><h3>The issue of consent</h3><p>In 2002, the European Union produced the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_and_Electronic_Communications_Directive_2002">ePrivacy Directive</a>, a charter for how companies needed to get consent for the use of cookies for advertising purposes. The rules, and how they are defined, have subsequently evolved, most recently with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">General Data Protection Regulations</a> (GDPR). One of the consequences of this drive is that users within the EU are presented with a pop-up banner asking them to consent to tracking. As most <a href="https://help.ft.com/legal-privacy/cookies/">cookie</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/info/cookies">policies</a> will explain, this tracking is used for both internal analytics and to enable tracking-based advertising.</p><p>To standardize and harmonize this process, IAB Europe created the<a href="https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework/blob/master/TCFv2/IAB%20Tech%20Lab%20-%20Consent%20string%20and%20vendor%20list%20formats%20v2.md#who-should-create-a-tc-string"> Transparency and Consent Framework</a> (TCF). This, essentially, lets publishers copy the framework laid down by the body on the assumption that they have established a legal basis to process that data. When someone does not give consent to be tracked, a record of that decision is logged in a piece of information known as a TC String. And it’s here that the ICCL has (seemingly) claimed a victory after lodging a complaint with the Belgian Data Protection Authority, the APD, saying that this record constitutes personal data.</p><p>A draft of the ruling was shared with IAB Europe and the ICCL, and reportedly said that the APD found that a TC String did constitute personal data. On November 5th, IAB Europe published a <a href="https://iabeurope.eu/all-news/update-on-the-belgian-data-protection-authoritys-investigation-of-iab-europe/">statement</a> saying that the regulator is likely to “identify infringements of the GDPR by IAB Europe,” but added that those “infringements should be capable of being remedied within six months following the issuing of the final ruling.” Essentially, because IAB Europe was not treating these strings with the same level of care as personal data, it needs to start doing so now and / or face potential penalties.</p><p>At the same time, Dr. Ryan at the ICCL declared that <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/news/online-consent-pop-ups-used-by-google-and-other-tech-firms-declared-illegal/">the campaign had “won” </a>and that IAB Europe’s whole “consent system” will be “found to be illegal.” He added that IAB Europe created a fake consent system that spammed everyone, every day, and served no purpose other than to give a thin legal cover to the massive data breach in at the heart of online advertising.” Ryan ended his statement by saying that he hopes that the final decision, when it is released, “will finally force the online advertising industry to reform.”</p><p>This reform will potentially hinge on the thorny question of if a user can reasonably be relied upon to consent to tracking. Is it enough for a user to click “I Accept” and therefore write the ad-tech intermediary involved a blank check? It’s a question that ad-tech expert and lawyer Sacha Wilson, a partner at <a href="https://www.harbottle.com/">Harbottle and Lewis</a>, is interested in. He explained that, in the law, “consent has to be separate, specific, informed [and] unambiguous,” which “given the complexity of ad tech, is very difficult to achieve in a real-time environment.”</p><p>Wilson also pointed out that something that is often overstated is the quality of the data being collected by these brokers. “Data quality is a massive issue,” he said, “a significant proportion of the profile data that exists is actually inaccurate — and that has compliance issues in and of itself, the inaccuracy of the data.” (This is a reference to Article 5 of the GDPR, where people who process data should ensure that the data is accurate.) In 2018, an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-05-my-digital-shadow-acxiom-corporation.html">Engadget analysis of data held by prominent data company Acxiom</a> showed that the information held on an individual can be often wildly inaccurate or contradictory.</p><p>One key plank of European privacy law is that it has to be easy enough to withdraw consent if you so choose. But it doesn’t appear as if this is as easy as it could be if you have to approach every vendor individually. Visit<em> ESPN</em>, for instance, and you’ll be presented with a list of vendors (listed by the OneTrust platform) that numbers into the several hundreds. <em>MailOnline’s</em> vendor list, meanwhile, runs to 1,476 entries. (Engadget’s, for what it’s worth, <a href="https://legal.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/privacy/topics/thirdparties/index.html#adtech">includes 323</a> “Advertising Technologies” partners.) It is not necessarily the case that all of those vendors will be engaged at all times, but it does suggest that users cannot simply withdraw consent at every individual broker without a lot of time and effort.</p><h3>Transparency and consent</h3><p>Townsend Feehan is the CEO of <a href="https://iabeurope.eu/">IAB Europe</a>, the body currently awaiting a decision from the APD concerning its data protection practices. She says that the thing that the industry’s critics are missing is that “none of this [tracking] happens if the user says no.” She added that “at the point where they open the page, users have control. [They can] either withhold consent, or they can use the right to object, if the asserted legal basis is legitimate interest, then none of the processing can happen.” She added that users do, or do not, consent to the discrete use of their data to a list of “disclosed data controllers,” saying that “those data controllers have no entitlement to share your data with anyone else,” since doing so would be illegal.</p><p>[Legitimate Interest is a framework within the GDPR enabling companies to collect data without consent. This can include where doing so is in the legitimate interests of an organization or third party, the processing does not cause undue harm or detriment to the person involved.]</p><p>While the type of sharing described by the ICCL and Dr. Ryan isn’t impossible, from a technical standpoint, Feehan made it clear that to do so is illegal under European law. “If that happens, it is a breach of the law,” she said, “and that law needs to be enforced.” Feehan added that at the point when data is first collected, all of the data controllers who may have access to that information are named.</p><p>Feehan also said that IAB Europe had practices and procedures put in place to deal with members found to be in breach of its obligations. That can include suspension of up to 14 days if a violation is found, with further suspensions liable if breaches aren’t fixed. IAB Europe can also permanently remove a company that has failed to address its policies, which it signs up to when it joins the TCF. She added that the body is currently working to further automate its audit processes in order to ensure it can proactively monitor for breaches and that users who are concerned about a potential breach can contact the body to share their suspicions.</p><p>It is hard to speculate on what the ruling would mean for IAB Europe and the current ad-tech regime more broadly. Feehan said that only when the final ruling was released would we know what changes the ad industry will have to institute. She asserted that IAB Europe was little more than a standards-setter rather than a data controller in real terms. “We don’t have access to any personal data, we don’t process any data, we’re just a trade association.” However, should the body be found to be in breach of the GDPR, it will need to offer up a clear action plan in order to resolve the issue.</p><h3>It’s not just consent fatigue</h3><p>The issue of Real-Time Bidding data being collected is not simply an issue of companies being greedy or lax with our information. The RTB process means that there is always a risk that data will be passed to companies with less regard for their legal obligations. And if a data broker is able to make some cash from your personal information, it may do so without much care for your individual rights, or privacy.</p><p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/mobilewalla-says-data-it-gathered-from-consumers-cellphones-ended-up-with-government-11637242202"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> recently reported that Mobilewalla, an Atlanta-based ad-tech company, had enabled warrantless surveillance through the sale of its RTB data. Mobilewalla’s vast trove of information, some of which was collected from RTB, was sold to a company called Gravy Analytics. Gravy, in turn, passed the information to its wholly-owned subsidiary, Venntel, which then sold the information to a number of federal agencies and related partners.</p><div id="b3eb13b4a7a74e9d80d46ba73b2e085c"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In its &#39;data dictionary&#39; doc from Dec 2020, Mobilewalla still states that it harvests and sells precise GPS location data including device IDs on people in GDPR countries like Germany, Spain, Finland, France, UK, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden.<br><br>Online here:<a href="https://t.co/6fXruZVqGm">https://t.co/6fXruZVqGm</a><a href="https://t.co/pD5xPJlUdL">pic.twitter.com/pD5xPJlUdL</a></p>— Wolfie Christl (@WolfieChristl) <a href="https://twitter.com/WolfieChristl/status/1461371902744797195?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>This trove of information may not have had real names attached, but the <em>Journal </em>says that it’s easy enough to tie an address to where a person’s phone is placed most evenings. And this information was, at the very least, passed on to and used by the Department of Homeland Security, Internal Revenue Service and US Military. All three reportedly tracked individuals both in the US and abroad without a warrant enabling them to do so.</p><p>In July 2020, Mobilewalla came under fire after reportedly revealing that it had tagged and tracked the identity of Black Lives Matter protesters. At the time, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/lawmakers-urge-ftc-probe-of-mobile-ad-industrys-tracking-of-consumers-11596214541?mod=article_inline"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> report added that the company’s CEO, in 2017, boasted that the company could track users while they visit their places of worship to enable advertisers to sell directly to religious groups.</p><p>This sort of snooping and micro-targeting is not, however, limited to the US, with the ICCL finding a report made by data broker OnAudience.com. The study, a <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4.-Evidence-of-election-interference-in-Poland-Appendix-A.pdf">copy of which it hosts on its website</a>, discusses the use of databases to create a cohort of around 1.4 million users. These people were targeted based on a belief that they were “interested in LGBTQ+,” identified because they had searched for relevant topics in the prior 14 days. Given both the unpleasant historical precedent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_homosexuals_in_Nazi_Germany">listing people</a> by their sexuality and the ongoing assault on LGBT rights in the country, the ease at which this took place may concern some.</p><h3>Looking to the future</h3><p>On November 25th, the APD <a href="https://www.gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit.be/burger/gba-stuurt-ontwerpbesluit-in-zaak-iab-europe-naar-europese-tegenhangers">announced</a> that it had sent its draft decision to its counterparts in other parts of Europe. If the procedure doesn’t hit any roadblocks, then the ruling will be made public around four weeks later, which means at some point in late December. Given the holidays, we may not see the likely fallout — if any — until January. But it’s possible that either this doesn’t make much of a change in the ad landscape, or it could be dramatic. What’s likely, however, is that the issues around how much a user can consent to having their data used in this manner won’t go away overnight.</p><p><strong>Update, Dec 3rd, 2021 12:30 PM ET:</strong> Corrected a reference to the IAB&#39;s Context Taxonomy which should have referred to its Audience Taxonomy.

For those using a wheelchair, the series is renamed &quot;Time to Push,&quot; and episodes center around a wheelchair workout instead of a walk.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-fitness-plus-time-to-walk-prince-william-151055655.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b0e687e5-0efc-4f1e-bd3a-203136752773</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 15:10:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638543971</ingested><modified>2021-12-03T15:06:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/78932350-5448-11ec-aebf-9c0f3083acf7" width="705" height="505" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/78932350-5448-11ec-aebf-9c0f3083acf7" width="705" height="505" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Prince William shown on an Apple Watch for his guest appearance on Apple Fitness+ series Time to Walk.

A new Insider build now lets you switch from Edge to Chrome, Firefox or other browsers with a single button, rather than laboriously changing the default for each type of link.</p><p>The change only applies to internal links loaded outside a browser. Currently, when you click on such a link, it opens up a dialog box that gives you the option of switching browsers, but your preference isn&#39;t retained unless you tick the &quot;always use this app&quot; box. What&#39;s worse, you have to set the default for multiple types of web files, including HTM, HTML, HTTP and HTTPS. Each time, a confusing nag box pops up asking you to reconfirm your preference.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="4339b7256dcd4f82875ed30fdcb88adb"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Windows build 22509 has a new browser [Set default] button. 👀 <a href="https://t.co/kRDFPKfJMv">pic.twitter.com/kRDFPKfJMv</a></p>— Rafael Rivera (@WithinRafael) <a href="https://twitter.com/WithinRafael/status/1466183359680299009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>In the latest build, you can set your default browser with a single button, as EarTrumpet app developer <a href="https://twitter.com/WithinRafael/status/1466183359680299009">Rafael Rivera</a> noticed. &quot;In the Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 22509 released to the Dev Channel on Wednesday, we streamlined the ability for a Windows Insider to set the ‘default browser’ to apps that register for HTTP:, HTTPS:, .HTM, and .HTML,&quot; Microsoft VP Aaron Woodman told <em>The Verge</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Shortly after Windows 11 came out, Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22630319/microsoft-windows-11-default-browser-changes">said</a> it made the changes to give users more granular control. That prompted complaints from rival browser makers including Brave, Opera, Firefox and Chrome. &quot;We condemn this Windows 11 approach, because the choice of a default browser has many implications for individuals and their privacy. Users should be free to choose,&quot; a Brave spokesperson told <em>The Verge</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft has run into fairly serious antitrust issues with its browsers in the past, having been hit by the EU with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-03-06-microsoft-european-commission-fine.html">$730 million fine</a> in 2013 for browser choice non-compliance. The EU also fined the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2008-02-27-microsoft-slammed-by-european-commission-with-1-4b-fine.html">$1.35 billion</a> in 2008 over a similar issue. The new feature is now in testing, but it&#39;s not clear when it will be released widely.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-is-killing-recent-changes-that-made-it-hard-to-switch-browsers-143041174.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4b70046d-17bd-40f8-83cf-a8bb1d929a8d</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 14:30:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638541845</ingested><modified>2021-12-03T14:30:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/36806620-543f-11ec-bfa2-95c80810d01c" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/36806620-543f-11ec-bfa2-95c80810d01c" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Microsoft is killing Windows 11 changes that made it hard to switch browsers]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Microsoft is killing Windows 11 changes that made it hard to switch browsers]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's one-day sale knocks up to 30 percent off 2022 Tile trackers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tile Bluetooth trackers were some of the many small gadgets <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tile-trackers-amazon-good-deal-170005129.html">on sale last week</a> for Black Friday, but you have another chance to grab some of the latest models for less today.
