Nura might have a solution. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nuratrue-true-wireless-headphones-140003973.html">Nuratrue</a> maker has introduced Nurabuds that aren&#39;t quite as sophisticated as the earlier model (more on that in a moment), but are only available through a &quot;Nuranow&quot; subscription. Pay $5 per month (plus a $19 one-time fee) and you&#39;ll get a fresh set of earbuds every 24 months, much like your carrier&#39;s phone installment plan.</p><p>You&#39;ll also get &quot;discounts, benefits and giveaways&quot; as part of your monthly outlay, according to Nura.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Nurabuds themselves are similar on the surface to the Nuratrue buds from before, complete with active noise cancellation and a world-amplifying social mode (ambient or transparency mode on rival devices). They&#39;re IPX4 water-resistant, too. Battery life is limited to four hours for the buds and 10 hours with the charging case, though. More importantly, you can&#39;t perform the Nuratrue&#39;s signature hearing test — you&#39;ll have to either import an existing profile or trust that Nura&#39;s &quot;in-house&quot; sound meets your needs.</p><p>This might be a viable option if you use your earbuds often enough to wear down the battery in two years, or if you just want to stay current. However, the subscription model might not make sense if you aren&#39;t a stickler for Nura&#39;s (admittedly quite good) audio quality. Amazon&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-buds-2nd-gen-review-130018884.html">second-gen Echo Buds</a>, for example, offer ANC, water resistance and other helpful features for as little as $100 in a one-time payment that lets you upgrade on your own terms. Nura is clearly betting that its reputation and people&#39;s habits will work in its favor — possibly a wise bet, but a bet nonetheless.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nura-nurabuds-subscription-wireless-earbuds-132117967.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e3e86713-971c-4f9f-be69-59590255b075</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 17 Aug 2021 13:21:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629206479</ingested><modified>2021-08-17T13:21:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Career & Education]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7052a6e0-ff55-11eb-aa9a-0ada57182184" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7052a6e0-ff55-11eb-aa9a-0ada57182184" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nura]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nura Nurabuds true wireless earbuds]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nura Nurabuds true wireless earbuds]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google Maps now shows Bird e-bike and scooter rentals, too]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, this is awkward. Just one day after Ford-owned Spin announced that its e-bike and scooter rentals <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-maps-spin-scooters-202029507.html">are now findable on Google Maps</a>, its competitor Bird has, well, exactly the same news to share. In a <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__bird.co_blog_&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=sWW_bEwW_mLyN3Kx2v57Q8e-CRbmiT9yOhqES_g_wVY&amp;r=4XnKqRFDm0mwnVfbG_7nXKXgzVgRH60VeeJpScCw2DY&amp;m=cfY7i4QsqlXNm7MKrMHS_hR4tmggzGQSZhSG9EG-d0U&amp;s=pHWSJv4QcWz6UXfjN8chWdiBnvr63ZIZMI5lZdTU4RU&amp;e=">blog post</a> of its own, Bird said that its electric bike and scooter rentals would start showing up in Google Maps today, with would-be riders able to see an approximate price, estimated trip duration and optimized route. The feature, available on both Google Maps&#39; iOS and Android apps, will ultimately still send the rider to the Bird app if they decide to go ahead and rent a vehicle.&nbsp;</p><p>All told, this sounds very similar to the announcement Spin made yesterday, including the fact that you need to open a separate app to actually pay for and unlock the rental. One interesting difference, though, is that Spin will show you the estimated battery range.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A Bird spokesperson told Engadget that the Google Maps feature will be available for users in all US cities where Bird scooters are available. The company also says it intends to roll out to additional countries following the US launch.

Before the physical exhibition arrives in Brooklyn on September 9th, a digital sister event is today launching online that showcases 3D interactive music videos from some of the support acts. The <a href="https://undercurrent.world">Undercurrent</a> digital platform includes original, unreleased music from Nosaj Thing, Mount Kimbie, Actress, Aluna, and Jayda G.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/84f64250-ff50-11eb-a7fc-5c380f79dcc1" style="height:1176;width:2092;" alt="Undercurrent" data-uuid="0a15e831-a882-334a-a7d3-f64af1535223"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Undercurrent / Jayda G</div></figure><p>Again, the focus is on spurring change around environmental issues through immersive art.

Staying with the aquatic theme, Nosaj Thing&#39;s clip illustrates the importance of plankton and its degradation through ocean pollution and dumping. While Aluna&#39;s interactive video will see users transported from an apartment in a post-apocalyptic future to a surreal rainforest, where they can climb trees in order to reconnect with nature.&nbsp;</p><div id="4fb809d135394719abd3feffae687ef2"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/slIGeb6uCHc?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Finally, Mount Kimbie&#39;s piece is from the perspective of a flying bee navigating through 3D worlds in a journey to find a lost flower to pollinate.

Notably, the Pro M1 has a built-in fan, something that Air M1 lacks, and it helps the laptop handle tough work like 3D rendering and laborious video encoding. In our testing, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-pro-m1-review-163011742.html">MacBook Pro M1</a> performed similarly to the Air M1 — Apple&#39;s SoC allows it to be incredibly fast and efficient, and it&#39;ll last all day with its 16.5-hour battery life.</p><p>But there are a few limitations to the Pro M1 that are worth considering before buying. Namely, the laptop only supports one external display and there&#39;s no external GPU support at all. While the latter is a bit of a niche concern, it&#39;s a bummer for those that rely on external cards to boost performance.

A team from the University of Applied Sciences Graubünden in Switzerland now <a href="https://www.fhgr.ch/fachgebiete/angewandte-zukunftstechnologien/davis-zentrum/pi-challenge/#c15509">claims</a> it has broken the world record for computing for the mathematical constant: It said it has calculated for 62.8 trillion digits of Pi. The <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/66179-most-accurate-value-of-pi">current record holder</a>, Timothy Mullican, calculated up to 50 trillion digits and was recognized for his work last year.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the Swiss university, its team took 108 days and 9 hours to compute for the new value. That&#39;s 3.5 times faster than Mullican&#39;s efforts and almost twice as fast as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-14-google-emma-haruka-iwao-pi-record.html">record Google set</a> in 2019. A couple of years ago, Emma Haruka Iwao and her colleagues used the power of 25 Google Cloud virtual machines to calculate for 31,415,926,535,897 digits of Pi within 121 days.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Swiss team, as <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/08/17/pi_world_record_challenged/"><em>The Register</em></a> explains, used a rig powered by two 32-core AMD Epyc 7542 processors with 1 TB of RAM and a program called y-Cruncher. Its setup had 38 hard drives with 16 TB of storage space each, 34 of which were used for the process while four were used to store the new value of Pi. The team didn&#39;t use SSDs, even though their speed would&#39;ve made the process quicker, because the large number of write cycles needed for Pi calculation would&#39;ve resulted in high wear and tear on the SSDs, which aren&#39;t cheap. That wouldn&#39;t have worked, since the university wanted to demonstrate that it&#39;s possible to carry out an extremely memory-intensive calculation with limited budget and resources. Guinness has yet to confirm the new record, but after it does, the university plans to publish the new and expanded value of Pi.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/swiss-university-world-record-pi-calculation-122534717.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e9e12fef-cf25-4430-8ac1-f90c378c8a74</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 17 Aug 2021 12:25:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629201835</ingested><modified>2021-08-17T12:03:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6fa8c160-ff4c-11eb-a5df-793dce95a855" width="6000" height="3090" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6fa8c160-ff4c-11eb-a5df-793dce95a855" width="6000" height="3090" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Olivier Le Moal via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[3D illustration of pi letter over a circle drawing.

The chip-maker has released a new reference design that contains all the latest connectivity and processing tech it has been talking up since last summer.

The chip-maker says the networking tech can help support drone-to-drone communications and drone swarms. Both use cases are being explored across industries, from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-04-24-nasa-drone-traffic-management-test.html">delivering</a> and transporting goods to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-drones-that-announced-joe-biden-as-the-46th-president-elect-150014496.html">aerial light displays</a> to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-10-dod-shows-off-its-first-successful-micro-drone-swarm-launch.html">military warfare</a>.

Those interested will also have to put down a $1,000 deposit to reserve it.</p><p>On a macro level, Qualcomm will be hoping the dedicated platform can accelerate drone development by leveraging the power of its latest mobile chips. This is far from an experiment for the company.

This is the latest step the automaker has taken to address issues in some Bolt EV models that make their batteries more likely to catch fire. As the publication notes, GM has recalled the Bolt EV twice in a little over a year before this and after over a dozen incidents wherein the vehicle went up in flames due to battery-related issues.</p><p>GM <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-recalls-chevy-bolt-over-battery-fire-reports-230044311.html">recalled</a> over 68,000 Bolt EVs back in November and rolled out a firmware update to limit their charging capacity to 90 percent. In July, the National Highway Traffic Administration <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-chevy-bolt-fire-warning-215322969.html">issued</a> a safety alert in July advising owners of 2017 to 2019 Chevrolet Bolt EVs not to park their cars indoors or leave them charging overnight. That warning came after two Bolt EVs caught fire in the US. Finally, in April, the automaker released what&#39;s supposed-to-be the final software fix for the issue. Clearly, that wasn&#39;t able to completely solve the problem, and GM had to find another solution.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Electrek</em> says GM has informed some owners that they&#39;ll be able to start booking appointments to have all the modules in their batteries replaced starting on August 23rd. Owners who go through with the replacement will also get a new 8-year 100,000 mile warranty. That said, Chevrolet will only replace battery modules in Bolts produced within the timeframe GM suspects battery manufacturing defects were present. Based on the vehicles that caught fire, <em>Electrek</em> says GM will likely prioritize 2019 models followed by 2017 and 2018 models. The company will also replace modules for owners who routinely do deep discharges.</p><p>GM told the publication that they&#39;re taking this step &quot;out of an abundance of caution.&quot; Further, GM and LG (the battery&#39;s manufacturer) will examine the replaced modules and find their defects. They&#39;ll also try to figure out if they can devise an in-situ detection method that would allow owners to figure out if their batteries are at risk of catching fire.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/gm-replace-chevy-bolt-battery-modules-fire-risk-100027066.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a04a1d91-ed99-4bfc-be3d-ed24e26a9162</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 17 Aug 2021 10:00:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629203074</ingested><modified>2021-08-17T12:24:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f672e500-ff55-11eb-bc7e-a344b17a73c5" width="1326" height="797" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f672e500-ff55-11eb-bc7e-a344b17a73c5" width="1326" height="797" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chevrolet]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A press image of a red 2020 Chevrolet Bolt EV parked in front of a building with grass in the foreground.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[2020 Chevrolet Bolt EV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Astro teams up with Timbuk2 to build the ultimate gamer bags]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As someone who regularly attends conventions like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/pax">PAX</a>, I know the importance of a good bag for your gaming gear. You need something that can snugly hold your <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/nintendo%20switch">Nintendo Switch</a>, controllers and headsets while also making room for all their cables and plugs. I’ve tried various solutions over the years but nothing’s ever really hit that sweet spot. However, today <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/astro%20gaming">Astro</a> is taking another swing at the problem with the help of storied bag brand <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/timbuk2">Timbuk2</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/40f96d00-fec6-11eb-a159-ce66d76fb984" alt="Backpack with headset and cords inside" data-uuid="81d36e9d-78ce-3f29-a39c-53e4834b2fe0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Timbuk2" href="https://fave.co/3iVCgwR">Timbuk2</a> is best known for its <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Timbuk2;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:striped messenger bag" href="https://fave.co/3xSVRC2">striped messenger bag</a>, but the brand’s new collaboration with Astro skips that style in favor of two different pieces, a backpack and a sling bag. Astro already offers the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Astro Gaming;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Scout Backpack" href="https://fave.co/2VRkSRb">$100 Scout Backpack</a> with plenty of pockets to store your gear, but the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$200 BP35" href="https://fave.co/3iTBHne">$200 BP35</a> is bigger: 35 liters of space compared to the previous model’s 32. It also has two laptop pockets, and a full clamshell opening to make it easier to remove your stuff — which certainly should make your life easier at airport security. One internal pocket is designed specifically to carry Astro gaming gear, with a loop for holding your headset, a padded sleeve for a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Astro;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:MixAmp Pro" href="https://fave.co/3CUzuzG">MixAmp Pro</a> and additional pockets for cords and controllers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are also plenty of small, thoughtful touches throughout, including mesh shoulder straps to keep you cool, velcro to showcase your pins and patches and a d-ring to hold your keys. And if you’re of the environmentally-conscious sort, all Timbuk2 products are made of recycled materials, and the company has an exchange program for your old bag so you can dispose of it in an eco-friendly way.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6086f890-fec6-11eb-a6f7-49b52b788d36" alt="Sling back with a Nintendo Switch, Pro Controller and games inside" data-uuid="60953106-ad34-3464-a15f-6849484a76d9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>But what if you don’t need a bag that big? 35 liters is a lot of space, after all, and all you have is your Switch Lite and a set of earbuds. This collaboration has you covered on that account with its <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$80 CS03" href="https://fave.co/3iTy2pf">$80 CS03</a> crossbody sling pack. You can wear it on your back, front or around your hips because fanny packs are back. But this is one made for your Nintendo Switch, with 14 slots for game cards and a tricot liner to protect your screen. There’s also a pocket for your smartphone and a key keeper so it’ll make a handy replacement for your purse or small shoulder bag. And I mean <em>small</em>, as the CS03 holds a scant three liters. It’s more of a daytripper than a convention pack.</p><p>I didn&#39;t get much time with the bags, but keep an eye out here for a hands-on after I test them on the mean streets of New York and Chicago. If you want to give them a whirl yourself, both bags go on sale later this month, and can be picked up on <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Astro" href="https://fave.co/3sreE65">Astro</a> or <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Timbuk2" href="https://fave.co/3iVCgwR">Timbuk2</a>’s sites as well as any of the six Timbuk2 flagship stores.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/astro-gaming-timbuk2-backpack-sling-pack-070125122.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">83fb611b-ce4f-46c0-961b-b522253caa50</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 17 Aug 2021 07:01:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629202221</ingested><modified>2021-08-17T12:10:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f509ba80-fec5-11eb-b577-9c2aea28e229" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f509ba80-fec5-11eb-b577-9c2aea28e229" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Kris Naudus / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Backpack and sling pack]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Astro x Timbuk2]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Activision drops 'Call of Duty: Vanguard' teaser ahead of official reveal]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Images for the next <em>Call of Duty</em> game have recently surfaced online, giving us a glimpse of what to expect for the future of the franchise.

Once you download the update from the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/icloud/9pktq5699m62?activetab=pivot:overviewtab#">Microsoft Store</a>, you can use the tool to add, edit, copy and paste, delete and look up any passwords you have stored in your iCloud keychain. You can also use the app in conjunction with a Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome extension to autofill a password when you’re surfing online.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apple says the app stores all your passwords within an encrypted database on your computer and transfers them to the relevant browser extension over a secure channel. The app will automatically save and sync any website usernames and passwords but won’t do the same for applications and other sensitive personal data like your credit card number.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s all pretty standard functionality apps like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/1-password-8-mac-early-access-120012791.html">1Password</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dashlane-essentials-plan-192046825.html">Dashlane</a> have offered for years, but if you’re an iPhone user who frequently saves their logins to iCloud, you’ll appreciate having easy access to them on your PC.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-icloud-version-12-5-212632356.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3ae26bbf-3730-4131-9220-2db5a2f9b54d</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2021 21:26:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629149196</ingested><modified>2021-08-16T21:26:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/60f4c5d0-fed7-11eb-af9b-17716f3379f8" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/60f4c5d0-fed7-11eb-af9b-17716f3379f8" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Igor Bonifacic / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iCloud Windows]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iCloud Windows]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[T-Mobile confirms unauthorized access to 'some' data]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following reports of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-data-breach-investigation-202913474.html"><ins>data breach over the weekend</ins></a>, T-Mobile has confirmed it’s investigating a cybersecurity incident.

For instance, Carnegie Mellon fitted its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/carnegie-mellon-snake-robot-swims-181159998.html"><ins>famous snakebot with turbines and thrusters</ins></a> earlier this year to give it aquatic capabilities. But few can do so with the grace, speed and effortlessness of a real-life fish. And it’s not that scientists have avoided trying to create a robot that can do just that, but the exact way fish swim faster or slower is something that has proved elusive.</p><p>Marine biologists have known for a while that the secret lies somewhere in the way they can alter the rigidity of their tails. The problem is that it’s difficult to measure that while a fish swims. However, using a combination of fluid dynamics and biomechanics, <a href="https://robotics.sciencemag.org/content/6/57/eabe4088"><ins>researchers from the University of Virginia</ins></a> say they’ve derived a formula that not only provides an answer to that question but also allows a robot with a specially designed tail to be nearly as good as its natural counterpart at speeding up and slowing down in water.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When they applied the formula to a tuna-like robot they built, they found it could swim at a greater variety of speeds using almost half as much energy as one with a fixed-stiffness tail. If you’re a cyclist, you’ll love this analogy. &quot;Having one tail stiffness is like having one gear ratio on a bike,&quot;  Dan Quinn, one of the co-authors of the study, told <a href="https://bigthink.com/technology-innovation/robot-tuna-tail"><em><ins>Big Think</ins></em></a>. &quot;You&#39;d only be efficient at one speed. It would be like biking through San Francisco with a fixed-gear bike; you&#39;d be exhausted after just a few blocks.&quot;</p><p>With a tuna-sized machine under their belt, the University of Virginia team plans to scale their tail technology for use on both bigger and smaller robots. They’re also developing one that undulates like a stingray. Their work could one day lead to a class of drones that can quickly travel to a remote location and then slow down to investigate the area. Like an aquatic snakebot, that&#39;s something the Navy could use to inspect their ships for damage.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tuna-robot-university-of-virginia-200013926.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">833d9418-da31-4e95-83d6-0b7015c4e553</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2021 20:00:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629144019</ingested><modified>2021-08-16T20:00:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/573879e0-feca-11eb-bbff-97fa64093af1" width="1600" height="1001" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/573879e0-feca-11eb-bbff-97fa64093af1" width="1600" height="1001" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[University of Virginia]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tuna robot]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tuna robot]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Wikipedia vandal adds swastikas to 53,000 pages]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/wikipedia"><ins>Wikipedia</ins></a> vandalism is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2006-11-10-bitter-fanboys-shred-nintendos-wikipedia-entry.html"><ins>hardly a new phenomenon</ins></a>, but one user was able to add swastikas to tens of thousands of articles.

However, a new development from MIT could change that. In a joint project with Shanghai Jiao Tong University, the school designed a <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/inflatable-robotic-hand-tactile-0816">neuroprosthetic that costs about $500</a> in components. It&#39;s an inflatable hand made from an elastomer called EcoFlex and looks a bit like Baymax from <em>Big Hero 6</em>.</p><div id="f334044c946f4779887c0820358bf49c"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p1d8i2lwuFw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The device foregoes electric motors in favor of a pneumatic system that inflates and bends its balloon-like digits. The hand can assume various grasps that allow an amputee to subsequently do things like pet a cat, pour a carton of milk or even pick up a cupcake. The device translates how its wearer wants to use it through a software program that &quot;decodes&quot; the EMG signals the brain sends to an injured limb.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The prosthetic weighs about half a pound and can even restore some sense of feeling for its user. It does this with a series of pressure sensors. When the wearer touches or squeezes an object, they send an electric signal to a specific position on their amputated arm. Another advantage of the arm is it doesn&#39;t take long to learn how to use it.  After about 15 minutes, two volunteers found they could write with a pen and stack checkers.</p><p>&quot;This is not a product yet, but the performance is already similar or superior to existing neuroprosthetics, which we&#39;re excited about,&quot; said Professor Xuanhe Zhao, one of the engineers who <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-021-00767-0">worked on the project</a>. &quot;There&#39;s huge potential to make this soft prosthetic very low cost, for low-income families who have suffered from amputation.&quot;</p><p>While we&#39;re a while away from seeing this tech in the real world, the team behind the project is already working on improving the design. They want to make it better at decoding electrical inputs and more customizable when it comes time for mass production.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/mit-neuroprosthetic-inflatable-robotic-hand-181806396.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a64883b9-c4a8-4bf1-bcc7-41a9c95d4012</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2021 18:18:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629137890</ingested><modified>2021-08-16T18:18:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/46918220-febc-11eb-ac7e-5f9b978b9663" width="1600" height="1001" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/46918220-febc-11eb-ac7e-5f9b978b9663" width="1600" height="1001" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[MIT]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[MIT neuroprosthetic balloon hand]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[MIT neuroprosthetic balloon hand]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Blue Origin takes NASA to court over SpaceX lunar lander contract]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jeff-bezos-nasa-open-letter-181522642.html">$2 billion Hail Mary</a>, Jeff Bezos&#39; Blue Origin has filed a complaint with the US Court of Federal Claims over NASA&#39;s handling of the Human Landing System program. The court challenge comes less than a month after the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gao-denies-blue-origin-dynetics-protest-nasa-human-landing-system-181019362.html">dismissed a protest</a> the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-blue-origin-225547469.html">filed in response to NASA&#39;s decision</a> to award a single contract for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-19-nasa-artemis-explainer-apollo-missions.html">Artemis lunar lander</a>. The agency went with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-nasa-artemis-lunar-lander-contract-report-184448656.html">$2.9 billion bid</a> from Elon Musk&#39;s SpaceX, opting not to fund a $5.9 billion proposal from Blue Origin.&nbsp;</p><p>NASA&#39;s original intention was to sign two separate contracts, but limited funding from Congress made that difficult to do so. Blue Origin alleged the decision was &quot;fundamentally unfair&quot; because NASA allowed SpaceX to modify its bid, something the company says it didn&#39;t get the opportunity to do as well. However, the GAO concluded NASA&#39;s &quot;evaluation of all three proposals was reasonable and consistent with applicable procurement law, regulation, and the announcement&#39;s terms.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="883936210821465a8db7fe13018e4855"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The sad thing is that even if Santa Claus suddenly made their hardware real for free, the first thing you’d want to do is cancel it</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1426326891485609985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 13, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>At the time, Blue Origin hinted it would escalate the situation. &quot;We stand firm in our belief that there were fundamental issues with NASA&#39;s decision, but the GAO wasn&#39;t able to address them due to their limited jurisdiction,&quot; the company said following the announcement.</p><p>&quot;Blue Origin filed suit in the US Court of Federal Claims in an attempt to remedy the flaws in the acquisition process found in NASA&#39;s Human Landing System,&quot; a spokesperson for Blue Origin told Engadget. &quot;We firmly believe that the issues identified in this procurement and its outcomes must be addressed to restore fairness, create competition, and ensure a safe return to the Moon for America.&quot;</p><p>What this means for the Human Landing System program and Project Artemis more broadly is likely another delay. Following Blue Origin&#39;s GAO protest, NASA ordered SpaceX to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lunar-lander-gao-223702744.html">stop work on the lunar lander contract</a> while the watchdog investigated the matter. While this latest complaint is sealed, a source told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22623022/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-sue-nasa-lawsuit-hls-lunar-lander"><em>The Verge</em></a> Blue Origin asked a judge to order a temporary pause on SpaceX&#39;s contract while the case is resolved in court. NASA and SpaceX lost about three months waiting for the GAO to investigate Blue Origin&#39;s protest. If a judge approves the company&#39;s request, this latest pause could be even longer. Ultimately, any further delays will make NASA&#39;s goal of returning to the Moon by 2024 difficult.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-federal-claims-court-nasa-challenge-163927526.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fb8f1e57-49ee-4f9f-b72e-449d353fb31f</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2021 16:39:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629131970</ingested><modified>2021-08-16T16:39:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d9074d00-ea36-11eb-bfb7-4e4759e4f1e8" width="5500" height="3515" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d9074d00-ea36-11eb-bfb7-4e4759e4f1e8" width="5500" height="3515" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Joe Skipper / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Billionaire American businessman Jeff Bezos wears goggles owned by Amelia Earhart which he carried into space at a post-launch press conference after he flew on Blue Origin's inaugural flight to the edge of space, in the nearby town of Van Horn, Texas, U.S., July 20, 2021.

Devices like Amazon&#39;s Kindles let you take your whole library with you, so you&#39;re never without options when picking your next read. They also make good student devices if you have a lot of digital textbooks available to you. Those looking to pick up a new e-reader for work or play can get a Kindle for less right now — Amazon just knocked the price of its <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Kindle Paperwhite" href="https://amzn.to/37OoTrW">Kindle Paperwhite</a> down to $80 and its standard <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Kindle" href="https://amzn.to/3m7Gd3x">Kindle</a> down to $65. While not a record low for the Kindle, the $50 discount on the Paperwhite brings it back down to its Prime Day price.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Kindle Paperwhite at Amazon - $80" href="https://amzn.to/37OoTrW">Buy Kindle Paperwhite at Amazon - $80</a><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Kindle at Amazon - $65" href="https://amzn.to/3m7Gd3x">Buy Kindle at Amazon - $65</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-13-kindle-paperwhite-review-2018.html">Paperwhite</a> may be three years old at this point, but it remains one of the best e-readers you can buy. Not only is it compact, but it has a waterproof design that will protect it against accidental splashes. Amazon updated it a few years ago with a higher-contrast display plus Audible support, which means you can listen to audiobooks when you have a pair of Bluetooth headphones connected to the device.</p><p>While we recommend the Paperwhite to those that can afford it, Amazon&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-10-amazon-kindle-review-2019.html">standard Kindle</a> is a much better buy now than it was a couple of years ago. When last updated, the Kindle received a higher-contrast display, a new front light that makes reading in dark places much easier and a smaller, sleeker design. It may not have the bells and whistles that the Paperwhite has, but it does its one and only job of displaying ebooks well.</p><p>That said, if you&#39;re still happy with your old yet trusty e-reader, it&#39;s probably not necessary to upgrade. Kindles have received some convenient new features over the past few years, but none fundamentally change the experience of reading an ebook. But for those that haven&#39;t yet taken the plunge, Amazon&#39;s latest sale is a great one to consider if you want to bring an e-reader into your life. The biggest caveat to keep in mind is that these discounts are on the ad-supported Kindles, so you&#39;ll have to deal with Amazon&#39;s &quot;special offers&quot; and lock screen ads on your e-reader.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-regular-kindle-sale-161429099.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3509439d-3980-465a-9537-5b6683c2b035</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2021 16:14:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629130527</ingested><modified>2021-08-16T16:15:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-07/b1455520-caaf-11ea-b7fd-cd71b511a902" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-07/b1455520-caaf-11ea-b7fd-cd71b511a902" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Kindle Paperwhite]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Kindle Paperwhite]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Intel Arc, the company's first gaming GPUs, will debut in 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/intel">Intel</a> has chosen a name for its high-performance consumer graphics products: Intel Arc.

The investigation will also include examination of the contributing circumstances for the confirmed crashes&quot; mentioned in the document as well as similar crashes, the ODI wrote.</p><p>The NHTSA <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-06-30-tesla-under-investigation-after-first-autopilot-related-death.html">investigated</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-19-investigation-clears-tesla-for-fatal-autopilot-crash.html">cleared</a> Tesla over the first Autopilot-related death in 2016. Since then, the agency has opened dozens of other probes into incidents in which it believes Autopilot was involved. In June, the NHTSA ordered automakers to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nhtsa-automated-driving-system-crash-report-174552853.html">report incidents</a> involving semi- and fully autonomous driving systems within 24 hours of learning about them.</p><p>Earlier this year, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ntsb-nhtsa-letter-tesla-210752970.html">urged the NHTSA</a> to issue stricter regulations for autonomous driving, citing Tesla in its letter. &quot;Tesla recently<a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-full-self-driving-beta-expansion-8-3-171559184.html"> released a beta version of its Level 2 Autopilot system</a>, described as having <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-full-self-driving-beta-october-20-171500591.html">full self-driving capability</a>,&quot; NTSB chair Robert Sumwalt wrote. &quot;By releasing the system, Tesla is testing on public roads a highly automated AV technology but with limited oversight or reporting requirements.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-autopilot-investigation-nhtsa-141310451.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d96a1d84-628b-4417-bc66-3a5ede8d25a4</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2021 14:13:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629123231</ingested><modified>2021-08-16T14:14:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/30065400-c4c3-11eb-b9ef-1f964935a881" width="7836" height="5224" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/30065400-c4c3-11eb-b9ef-1f964935a881" width="7836" height="5224" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NICOLAS ASFOURI via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The inside of a Tesla car Model 3 is seen at a Tesla shop inside of a shopping Mall in Beijing on May 26, 2021.
