We meet again, Razer Huntsman. The company&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-28-razer-huntsman-elite-hands-on.html">first opto-mechanical keyboard</a> was an interesting experiment, one I wasn‚Äôt too fond of thanks to its unpleasant key feel and noise. After three years (and a mini edition) later Razer is back with a new $190 version, and it does seem the designers finally nailed it.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/113aab70-165d-11ec-9f6c-e6f8d13b254c" style="height:1067;width:1600;" alt="Keys on the Razer Huntsman v2" data-uuid="a956af94-9f3a-3432-a10f-403b4ffc29f6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>First, a refresher: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/corsair-k100-gaming-keyboard-hands-on-130002628.html">opto-mechanical keys</a> have a small laser beam under each switch. When you press a key, it blocks the light path, sending a signal to the computer of what you just pressed. Because it doesn‚Äôt need to fully actuate (go up and down) on a physical level, it‚Äôs supposedly faster than traditional mechanical keyboards. In practice I didn‚Äôt really notice the difference and even now I can‚Äôt really distinguish the nanoseconds shaved off with each key press on the Huntsman V2.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1861c400-165e-11ec-a47f-2f15d2851388" style="height:1080;width:1920;" alt="Red and purple key switches" data-uuid="7946b6e6-0663-3db7-98f2-2e7b80a46ab8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Razer</div></figure><p>However, what I can feel and hear is the layer of foam padding under the keys that mutes each stroke, which makes it a much more agreeable auditory experience ‚Äî the first version had this annoying metallic echo that I could pick up even with my admittedly poor hearing. Granted, if you‚Äôre wearing a headset and listening to gunshots or music you probably won‚Äôt notice, but if you work in an office as I do, or share a small space with others, the comfort of those around you matters.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8eab8de0-165d-11ec-9f3c-48ba0f08f31e" style="height:1080;width:1920;" alt="Razer Huntsman v2 with wrist rest" data-uuid="62771dba-3136-31a0-a7f6-eceb43b7f893"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Razer</div></figure><p>Now the keystrokes are still crisp but instead of hearing a metallic scratching sound it‚Äôs more a muffled thud. (You can choose clickier keys at checkout.) And the switches aren‚Äôt the only improvement Razer made toward comfort. There‚Äôs a larger, squishier wrist rest available at extra cost for those who like having one, which connects to the Huntsman v2 magnetically so you can easily pull it off when it gets in the way ‚Äî the spacious rest adds another four inches to the 5.5-inch keyboard‚Äôs depth.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/deeb2470-165b-11ec-bfcf-5ba7a5216a60" style="height:1067;width:1600;" alt="keyboard in black on a blue background" data-uuid="8282331f-cfac-3a58-a2e6-ea1970a6f5a0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>However, if you find yourself really crunched for space, Razer is also releasing a $130 tenkeyless version of the Huntsman V2.

It wasn‚Äôt the first flagship camera from the company, but I‚Äôd argue it was instrumental in bringing the GoPro to the attention of the general public. Back then, the maximum resolution was 1080p, photos topped out at 5-megapixel and it came shrouded in that iconic waterproof housing.</p><p>A decade later, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Hero 10 Black" href="https://fave.co/3ClOJjY">Hero 10 Black</a> (revealed today) offers a whopping 5.3K max video resolution, 23-megapixel photos, no longer needs a waterproof housing (for most uses) and has a slew of fancy shooting modes that we couldn‚Äôt even have imagined three presidents ago.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Before we get to the review part, though, you likely want to know what else has changed. The headline feature is clearly the new GP2 processor. GoPro started using its homegrown chip, the GP1, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-28-gopro-hero-6-and-gp1.html">a few years ago</a>. Now, the second iteration is here and brings with it a boost in frame-rates across the board (5.3K at 60; 4K at 120 and 2.7K at 240 to name a few).</p><p>Even the front-facing display benefits from an increased frame rate, which should make your previews smoother. GoPro also states that the GP2 brings with it an image processor (ISP) that promises improved quality photos and videos. We‚Äôll be the judge of that, of course.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8bb4ad20-163e-11ec-8f7f-4c5a001d14b2" alt="GoPro Hero 10 review." data-uuid="e38f1f64-56f2-39b2-849c-bbb71a00baf5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>You may have noticed that the max resolution for video is now a shade higher than last year at 5.3K (up from 5). We‚Äôre told the sensor is actually the same as before, but that the new chip running the show can eke out more use of it.</p><p>The camera itself is, thankfully, the same dimensions as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gopro-hero-9-black-review-140026287.html">the Hero 9</a> which means if you have a media mod or Hero 9-specific accessory it‚Äôll likely work with the new model just fine. In fact, the only visible differences between last year‚Äôs model and the Hero 10 is‚Ä¶ the number 10 and the color of the text branding ‚Äî it‚Äôs now GoPro blue rather than gray.</p><h2>GP2 times the power</h2><p>The GP1, GoPro‚Äôs first custom processor, made its debut with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-19-gopro-hero-6-review.html">Hero 6 Black</a>. It allowed the company to tightly integrate the brains of the camera with the rest of the hardware and yield more control over key features. With the GP2, the promise is ‚Äútwice the performance.‚Äù The company hasn‚Äôt shared specifics about the chip itself, but the rewards are evidenced in the increased frame rates across the board. I already mentioned that the upper-most resolution is now .3 megapixels higher than last time <em>and </em>available at 60fps. Twice the frames of the equivalent on the Hero 9 Black.</p><p>There are other benefits to the new chip beyond FPS, though. Not least, it‚Äôs paired with that ISP which we‚Äôll go into in more detail next. The GP2 also powers the updated HyperSmooth 4.0, and promises a slicker user interface and faster offloading of media (again, each of these will get its own section).</p><h2>Image quality</h2><p>While GoPro is touting the new framerate modes as one of the key upgrades this time around, I feel the image quality is worth tackling first ‚Äî this is a camera after all. The good news is that it‚Äôs markedly better than the Hero 9. It‚Äôs tempting to assume that the higher resolution for both video and photos is to thank here, but there‚Äôs some other processing grunt going on in the background.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/18274db0-164b-11ec-94bd-70bd1b646249" alt="GoPro Hero 10 Black review." data-uuid="a02a9cff-4acf-36eb-89c1-b25671fe2a2c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>According to GoPro, new algorithms for tone mapping and noise reduction are also responsible for the bump in quality. All I know is that both videos and photos look better, and in a meaningful way. When I was reviewing my comparison footage, color reproduction was a lot more faithful without looking flat. Somehow natural and inorganic tones (say, buildings and trees) look deeper. On top of that is the fidelity. When I viewed images at 100-percent crop, the difference in detail was instantly obvious. Where some textures, like road surface or leaves, on the Hero 9 can smooth out when they‚Äôre not the primary subject of the video, on the Hero 10 you can spot features that aren‚Äôt present in last year‚Äôs camera.</p><p><strong>Higher resolutions</strong></p><p>On top of the general improvement in image quality is the added flexibility that comes with the new resolution and framerate combinations. The Hero 9 topped out at either 5K/30fps in 16:9 or 4K/30 at 4:3. Not bad. But the Hero 10 offers a pretty substantial increase with 5.3K/30fps or 4K/60 at 4:3 and 5.3K/60 when shooting in 16:9. That‚Äôs a lot of jargon, but essentially it means you have a lot more headroom for both 16:9 and 4:3 aspect ratios. And given that 4:3 is great for POV shots, a staple of the action world, that‚Äôs good news for your videos.</p><p>It‚Äôs easy to wonder why you might even want 5.3K video, given there‚Äôs not a lot you can natively play it back on. But more pixels is never a bad thing and you can scale something down to a more ‚Äúconventional‚Äù resolution later or crop to 4K without losing quality. You now even have something close to slow-mo at 4K (60fps) in the 4:3 aspect ratio which is a first for a GoPro.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/3faae1f0-1649-11ec-bfff-b143d139678d" alt="GoPro Hero 10 Black review." data-uuid="382e64f6-ff2a-3f4d-8f3a-0fd35c5d8093"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Then, of course, there‚Äôs that increase in photo resolution that we already mentioned. Three whole megapixels is a decent improvement from last time around and if you pull stills from video on the regular you‚Äôll enjoy higher resolution there, too (the change varies depending on your video settings, but it‚Äôs an increase across the board).</p><p><strong>More frames</strong></p><p>Finally we can get to one of the marquee upgrades: Frame rates. With GP2 onboard, 4K video is now available at 120fps, giving the Hero 10 a respectable slow-mo mode for the first time at UHD. Last year‚Äôs camera could eke out 60fps at 4K, but 2X isn‚Äôt really enough to show off your laser flips in all their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yRttQvEV1A">mind-boggling glory</a>. The new 4X slow-mo at this high resolution is going to really show off your best moves. The new 120fps mode is available with almost all the field-of-view options, which GoPro calls ‚Äúlenses,‚Äù bar SuperView which tops out at 60fps. 2.7K also gets a boost from 120fps to 240 ‚Äî the max the camera can do, making this a great balance of resolution and framerate for action.</p><p>Of course, a high frame rate isn‚Äôt only about slow-mo, that‚Äôs just a common application for it on an action camera. A higher FPS also helps keep your videos looking smooth at normal speed, especially if there‚Äôs a lot of activity going on ‚Äî which, again, seems quite likely with a GoPro. For example, I shot some videos on a bike ride at 4K/30fps and then some more later at 60fps and the sense of motion at the higher frame rate is noticeably much smoother even when played back at normal speed.</p><p>In short, frame rate is another tool in the box when it comes to lining up your shot so it‚Äôs great to see far more options here. It also means you don‚Äôt have to make a choice between FPS or high resolution nearly as much as you did in the past.</p><h2>HyperSmooth 4.0</h2><p>In a darker age, GoPros had no onboard stabilization. It meant handheld footage had to be shot with extreme care, and every twitch, pothole or wobble was recorded in great clarity. That was fine for some activities, but often it just meant you ended up with unusable footage or a spell in post to try and salvage things.</p><p>Since the Hero 7, we‚Äôve lived in a lighter, brighter world where HyperSmooth would work its magic and make even the most jarring pursuit look slick and smooth on video without having to use a pricey, fragile gimbal. With the Hero 10 we‚Äôre now on the fourth revision of GoPro‚Äôs onboard stabilizing and it continues to work wonders.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/805ac9e0-1649-11ec-9def-bc82770f7e65" alt="GoPro Hero 10 Black review." data-uuid="bf4a71a4-1d17-341d-8299-45a450f07919"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Perhaps the most notable change here is the increased power of horizon levelling. Before, it would keep videos ‚Äúflat‚Äù to the skyline up to about 27 degrees. After that, it‚Äôd gently tilt your video to match the angle of the camera. Now, you can hit a curve or ride a corner at 45-degrees and your video will steadfastly lock to the horizon.</p><p>As with all things, just because you can, doesn‚Äôt mean you (always) should. I like using horizon levelling with mounts, selfie sticks or anything that can easily go off-level while holding. In contrast, you <em>could</em> use it while mounted to handlebars, for example, but any tight turns or dramatic leans will get neatly ironed out. You‚Äôll have a smooth video for sure, but it loses a little of the action dynamic. Fortunately, you can decouple horizon levelling from HyperSmooth right on the home screen of the camera so it‚Äôs right there when you need it (or don‚Äôt).</p><h2>Front screen</h2><p>All new on the Hero 9 was the addition of a front screen for framing yourself when looking at the camera. DJI came out of the gate with one on its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-15-dji-osmo-action-review.html">Osmo Action</a>, beating GoPro to market by weeks. Nonetheless, it‚Äôs now a mainstay feature and thus, subject to upgrades, too.</p><p>The one on the Hero 10 is the same size as last year, but with a small increase in frame rate ‚Äî from 20fps to 30. It‚Äôs nice to see the company updating all aspects of the camera, but I personally don‚Äôt notice much difference, certainly not at arm&#39;s length, which is most of the time I find myself needing that second display. Either way, if you found the screen a little lacking in this regard, just know that there‚Äôs likely a better experience for you this time around.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b3e86ba0-1649-11ec-9ffe-acd0f2f876a9" alt="GoPro Hero 10 Black review." data-uuid="8a8b4f9d-2de4-3f69-b875-799b5d30f27e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Not so much a feature of the front screen, but it relates to the front, so here is the time to mention it: The Hero 10 now has an ‚Äúhydrophobic‚Äù coating on the lens. If you‚Äôve ever taken a GoPro into the water, you‚Äôll know that drops on the lens are the fastest way to ruin your footage. They normally sit just where the action is taking place, too.</p><p>I haven‚Äôt been able to give this camera the full water test yet, but simply getting it wet, you can tell that water doesn‚Äôt gather in the large, subject-blurring drips as it did before. It‚Äôs not entirely water repellant, but big drops are a thing of the past, instead the worst you get is a collection of smaller droplets. These are still undesirable, but they seem to have less impact on what you‚Äôre shooting, so I‚Äôll take it.</p><h2>Faster navigation</h2><p>Another light improvement is in the user interface and menu navigation. GoPro claims the touch screen is now more responsive and most tasks should be quicker. This definitely does appear to be the case. Older cameras sometimes need two (or even three) attempts for a press to be registered, but with the Hero 10 there were far fewer occasions where I found myself needing to tap more than once.</p><p>An even clearer example of the software side of things being more rapid is the amount of time it takes to process an HDR photo. While the exposure is instant, GoPro owners will be familiar with the swirling circles after an image is taken while the camera develops the photo. It‚Äôs not long, usually a couple of seconds, but with the Hero 10 that time is about cut in half. Between that and the general nippiness of the menus, the latest flagship definitely feels a little breezier to use.</p><p>One other small usability change that doesn‚Äôt technically fit here, but adds to the user experience is that the Hero 10 now allows for good old fashioned wired transfer. That is, simply connect the camera to your computer and it‚Äôll show up as removable storage with direct access to your media. It‚Äôs kinda hard to believe that this wasn‚Äôt a thing before, but I double checked with my Hero 9 and, nope, nothing ‚Äî you have to get handsy with the memory card and an adapter. Small graces, but we love to see it.</p><h2>Battery life</h2><p>Everything has been quite positive so far, so it‚Äôs time for a small spanner in the works. Battery life has never really been GoPro&#39;s strong suit, although it has generally improved over time. Alas, the Hero 10 feels like a small step backward. It‚Äôs not deal-breaking levels, but on a straight ‚Äúclick record and leave the camera‚Äù shoot out, the Hero 9 outlasted the Hero 10 by almost half an hour ‚Äî clocking in at 1hr40 at 4K/30fps. When I did the same test (with the same actual battery) on the new camera, it only managed 1hr15.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f9944430-1649-11ec-abf7-671b01fb8035" alt="GoPro Hero 10 Black review." data-uuid="a43fa2e4-3d66-359d-a6ca-6783a5d6c41a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>GoPro, for its part, claims that most users are only shooting short videos and it‚Äôs optimized the camera (and its battery usage) for that scenario. That might be true, but one must presume that that hasn‚Äôt changed since the last camera. And regardless of your shooting habits, the physics of higher processing will always diminish your overall shooting time.</p><p>Things get even worse once you start flirting with those new higher frame rates. On my first day out testing I thought I might have a duff cell as it sunk to about 50-percent battery unusually quickly. It was only later that I confirmed that this is just the price to pay for smoother videos.</p><p>There‚Äôs not a lot more to add here, as this is somewhat to be expected: You‚Äôre asking a battery of the same capacity to do a lot more work. Let‚Äôs hope that future revisions and maybe even some software updates can claim back some of those precious lost minutes.</p><h2>Price</h2><p>Last year, GoPro tried something‚Ä¶ different, when it came to pricing. If you bought the camera on its own, it cost $450. That was a little higher than the flagship it replaced (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-01-gopro-hero-8-black-review.html">the Hero 8</a> sold for $399 at launch). BUT, and it was a big but, if you were willing to sign up for a GoPro subscription at the same time, the total price you paid was $350 ‚Äî which suddenly felt like a solid deal.</p><p>The same deal is in place this time around, just it‚Äôs $50 more expensive. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:camera and subscription bundle" href="https://fave.co/3ClOJjY">camera and subscription bundle</a> now costs $399 and the camera on its own is $499. Given how easy the company is making it for you to get that subscription though ‚Äî if you have an active subscription already, you‚Äôll get the subscription price ‚Äî it‚Äôs fairly easy to get the lower price. In short, make sure you snag a subscription or already have one when you order.</p><p>Ultimately, the Hero 10 isn‚Äôt the cheapest flagship at launch, but neither is it the most expensive ‚Äî that honor goes to the Hero 6 which cost $499 with no route to pay less. GoPro reduced that price to $400 though soon after launch. It might sting a little that it‚Äôs more cost than last year‚Äôs, especially if you‚Äôd been hoping to get the latest and greatest for the same price, but with general improvements the whole way round it‚Äôs likely not something you will dwell on for long ‚Äî especially as the Hero 9 will retain that $350 price tag along side the Hero 10 as the now ‚Äúmid-tier‚Äù option.</p><h2>Wrap up</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1cd317f0-164a-11ec-96af-402492a10c43" alt="GoPro Hero 10 Black review." data-uuid="f783195c-b71e-3d64-b9e0-91fcd509268e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>For a spell, it looked like DJI was going to maintain the pressure on GoPro with its Osmo Action line. But so far it seems like it‚Äôs taking its time when it comes to new models ‚Äî although you can pick up the original for $200 now, which makes it attractive if price is your main concern. Likewise, Sony seems to have taken its foot off the gas when it comes to refreshing its own, quite popular, line of action cameras. There is, of course, also Insta360, which has gained a solid fan base thanks to its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/insta360-go-2-action-cam-minions-bello-banana-140059750.html">unique form-factors</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-07-insta360-one-r-leica-modular-action-cam.html">modular model</a>.</p><p>It‚Äôs a familiar ending here, then. The new camera takes everything that‚Äôs working and builds on it. Especially in the areas that matter: Image quality and shooting modes. That‚Äôs all we can really ask for. The fact that there are many other usability tweaks is just an added bonus. The apparent dip in battery life, while not ideal, will only really be an issue if you use those new frame rates as standard. As for the price, we‚Äôd love for it to have stayed the same as last year‚Äôs launch, but the increase isn‚Äôt into unrealistic territory.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/gopro-hero-10-review-a-big-invisible-upgrade-130041612.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7a786f4f-44d9-4299-9480-c33d8f3d19ee</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 13:00:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631800294</ingested><modified>2021-09-16T13:51:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1340a5b0-163e-11ec-bfe9-460febe0f005" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1340a5b0-163e-11ec-bfe9-460febe0f005" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[James Trew / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[GoPro Hero 10 review.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[GoPro Hero 10 review]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[‚ÄòStar Trek: Lower Decks‚Äô cleans out its literal and metaphorical closets]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This post contains light spoilers for season two, episode six of ‚Äò</em><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Paramount+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Star Trek: Lower Decks" href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/a1Wk1R"><em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em></a><em>.‚Äô</em></p><p>In last week‚Äôs episode, <em>Lower Decks</em> wrapped up the first half of its second season by addressing some leftover plot threads from season one, namely Rutherford‚Äôs memory loss and the fallout between Mariner and Boimler. With those issues out of the way the series is free to move forward. But first, this week‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Spy Humongous‚Äù takes some time to look at an average day onboard the <em>USS Cerritos</em>. It‚Äôs not quite the <em>TNG</em> classic ‚Äú<a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Data&#39;s_Day_(episode)">Data&#39;s Day</a>,‚Äù but it‚Äôs close enough for fans of smaller, more intimate Trek stories.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="208eec755674462da1cbf7ff1fba887d"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9vkzjGBAcTM?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>There‚Äôs no strict division between A-plot and B-plot this time, with both upper and lower decks crew starring in four loosely connected stories. The bridge crew is attempting to negotiate a ceasefire with the Pakleds, while the ensigns have been assigned to ‚Äúanomaly consolidation duty,‚Äù which is a fancy way of saying ‚Äúclearing out weird space junk.‚Äù Boimler is thrilled, but he gets pulled away by a group of career-driven ‚Äúredshirts‚Äù who think his time on the <em>USS Titan</em> makes him prime command material. And Ransom ends up babysitting a Pakled defector/tourist/spy. It‚Äôs a grab bag of jokes and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-episode-four-070120756.html">Star Trek lore</a>, sure to please any long-time Trekkie.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/9e3815f0-1660-11ec-bffb-f3a5efb6eb4f" data-uuid="c21e5b22-66a5-332d-bec0-92561b028b5b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>However, it‚Äôs still remarkably newcomer friendly, in that it doesn‚Äôt require too much background to understand the basic plot, while also illustrating the show‚Äôs core concept as a show about the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-premiere-strange-energies-070032163.html">nuts and bolts of Starfleet</a>. If this were a live-action show it would be what‚Äôs called a ‚Äúbottle episode,‚Äù one shot on a limited budget using pre-built sets and the regular cast. Even on the one exotic locale we‚Äôre shown ‚Äî Pakled Planet ‚Äî we never actually go inside any buildings. It‚Äôs an interesting contrast to last week‚Äôs <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-070123812.html">expansive tour of Starbase 25</a>.</p><p>In live action programming, bottle episodes exist because a show blew through its guest star or special effects budget on a big important story, and ‚ÄúAn Embarrassment of Dooplers‚Äù would fit that bill. But as I pointed out last week, <em>Lower Decks</em> is not limited by what a set designer can build or how much makeup an actor will wear or how long would it take to render a sentient gaseous anomaly on a green screen. The animators can draw whatever needs to be drawn. So there‚Äôs no reason to follow the trope of a bottle episode except that‚Ä¶ they want to.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/bbed5f10-1660-11ec-bdbf-6981a3ba1d37" data-uuid="c8f1724a-cf34-3c1c-a679-b160e9e55ab4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p><em>Lower Decks</em> has made no secret that it‚Äôs essentially a giant love letter to Star Trek. What was initially predicted to be ‚Äú<em>Family Guy</em> in space,‚Äù ended up treating the franchise with a lot of respect, and was packed full of jokes for the fandom to discuss and catalog in places like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/">Reddit</a> and Trek wiki <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/">Memory Alpha</a>. But this week‚Äôs adventure illustrates that attention to Star Trek tropes and backstory can go beyond showcasing little-seen alien species or getting justice for murdered characters.</p><p>It‚Äôs also about the love of how Star Trek tells its stories, with a strong emphasis on the personal aspect. Here we get to see Freeman, Mariner and the others simply do their jobs. We know they‚Äôre not going to die, especially not mid-season, so it‚Äôs really about seeing how they handle adversity and ultimately, what made them Starfleet material in the first place.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-episode-six-130040781.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a369d18c-ef93-4381-a39d-52df1d02ff71</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 13:00:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631799217</ingested><modified>2021-09-16T13:33:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Television]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/63d9eaa0-1660-11ec-bebf-2681d9f1c493" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/63d9eaa0-1660-11ec-bebf-2681d9f1c493" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[CBS]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA["The Spy Humongous"  -- Eugene Cordero as Ensign Rutherford, Tawny Newsome as Ensign Beckett Mariner and Noel Wells as Ensign Tendi of the Paramount+ series STAR TREK: LOWER DECKS.

The Air Dream Edition Range will go 520 miles on a charge, &quot;delivering at least 100-plus miles of additional range of its closest competitor,&quot; the company announced. The models tested &quot;now occupy the top six positions for overall EPA range ratings among EVs,&quot; according to Lucid.</p><p>The Air Dream Edition models (Range and Performance) both offer 113kWh battery packs ‚Äî significantly larger than the 100 kWh used in Tesla‚Äôs Model S Long Range Plus  ‚Äî but the company said the prodigious range is not just due to that.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;This landmark has been achieved... not by simply installing an oversize battery pack,‚Äù said Lucid CEO/CTO Peter Rawlinson. ‚ÄúOur race-proven 900V battery and BMS [battery management system] technology, our miniaturized drive units, coupled with our Wunderbox [drivetrain] technology endow Lucid Air with ultra-high efficiency, enabling it to travel more miles from less battery energy.&quot;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f6568aa0-16d3-11ec-bdfd-4f775dd614dc" alt="Lucid&#39;s limited edition Air EV rated for a Tesla-beating 520 miles of EPA rang" data-uuid="911f5926-b0e3-38fd-84da-81ce1f1ec713"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Lucid Motors</div></figure><p>The Air&#39;s very low 0.21 drag coefficient likely helps too, particularly on the highway. When considering EPA range versus battery size, the range model delivers 4.6 miles per kWh, compared to 4.01 miles per kWh for the Tesla Model S long range.&nbsp;</p><p>Performance isn&#39;t sacrificed in the range model either, despite the name. It still delivers 933 horsepower, enough to kick it from 0 to 60 MPH in 2.7 seconds and hit a top speed of 168 MPH. The 1,111 horsepower performance version, meanwhile, will travel 471 miles on a charge and the 800 horsepower Lucid Air Grand Touring will go 516 miles. Tests were done with 19-inch wheels, and all models will travel significantly less far (though probably look cooler) with 21-inch wheels.&nbsp;</p><p>You&#39;ll certainly pay for that range and performance, however. The Air Dream Edition models, released in limited run of 500 and arriving first to market, will start at $169,000. The Air Grand Touring model will show up later for $139,000, followed by the $95,000 Air Touring and finally the base, sub-$80,000 Air. When they&#39;ll go on sale is still an open question, though. Lucid most recently promised the second half of 2021 for the first limited edition models, but it has already <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-31-lucid-motors-air-debut-delay.html">missed</a> a number of previous deadlines.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lucids-longest-range-air-ev-has-a-prodigious-520-miles-of-epa-range-123000043.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ba2ff304-5372-4c15-ac81-6a4eb5a0fa6b</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 12:30:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631802365</ingested><modified>2021-09-16T14:26:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1d2467a0-16cb-11ec-aafc-b8a4cf72e781" width="1373" height="773" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1d2467a0-16cb-11ec-aafc-b8a4cf72e781" width="1373" height="773" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Lucid]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Lucid's longest range Air EV has a prodigious 520 miles of EPA range]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Lucid's longest range Air EV has a prodigious 520 miles of EPA range]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's 2021 iPad is already $30 off at Walmart]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the devices Apple revealed during its latest hardware event is an updated <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-a13-bionic-171718680.html">10.2-inch iPad</a> with prices that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-pre-order-the-new-apple-ipad-and-ipad-mini-2021-184818462.html">start at $329</a>.

The high speed wireless optical link technology originally developed for Loon is currently being used for another moonshot called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/project-taara-fsoc-internet-alphabet-econet-liquid-telecom-africa-103541990.html">Project Taara</a>. In a new <a href="https://x.company/blog/posts/taara-beaming-broadband-across-congo/">blog post</a>, Taara&#39;s Director of Engineering, Baris Erkmen, has revealed that the initiative&#39;s wireless optical communications (WOC) links are now beaming high-speed connectivity across the Congo River.&nbsp;</p><p>The idea for Taara started when the Loon team successfully used WOC to beam data between Loon balloons that were more than 100 kilometers apart. The team wanted to explore how the technology can be used on the ground. As part of the team&#39;s exploration on WOC&#39;s potential applications, they worked on bridging the connectivity gap between Brazzaville in the Republic of the Congo and Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The two locations are separated by the Congo River and are only 4.8 kilometers apart. However, internet connectivity costs much, much more in Kinshasa, because providers will have to lay down enough fiber connection to cover 400 kilometers of ground around the river. What Project Taara did was install links that can beam high-speed connectivity from Brazzaville to Kinshasa across the river instead. Within 20 days and with 99.9 percent availability, the links served served nearly 700 TB of data.</p><p>Taara&#39;s WOC links work by seeking each other out and linking their beams of light together to create a high-speed internet connection. It&#39;s not ideal for use in foggy locations, but Project Taara has developed network planning tools that can estimate WOC availability based on various factors like weather. In the future, the team will be able to use those tools to plan for the locations where Taara&#39;s technology will work best.</p><p>Baris Erkmen, Director of Engineering for Taara, wrote in the post:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Better tracking accuracy, automated environmental responses and better planning tools are helping Taara&#39;s links deliver reliable high-speed bandwidth to places that fiber can&#39;t reach, and helping us connect communities that are cut off from traditional ways of delivering connectivity. We&#39;re really excited about these advances, and are looking forward to building on them as we continue developing and refining Taara&#39;s capabilities.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/alphabet-project-taara-high-speed-internet-congo-river-105835108.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4e4733fb-f94f-436c-9d10-91a50ce03c59</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 10:58:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631789922</ingested><modified>2021-09-16T10:58:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6bea8e80-16d2-11ec-b754-dbb6c7d310f9" width="1400" height="933" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6bea8e80-16d2-11ec-b754-dbb6c7d310f9" width="1400" height="933" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Project Taara]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Project Taara]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Project Taara]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[FTC set to keep a closer eye on smaller acquisitions made by tech giants]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-facebook-amended-antitrust-case-161230871.html">FTC</a> Chair Lina Khan wants the commission to identify potential loopholes in its merger reporting guidelines that allowed some acquisitions to &quot;fly under the radar,&quot; according to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/15/ftc-presents-findings-from-study-of-small-tech-mergers.html"><em>CNBC</em></a>. That&#39;s one of the FTC&#39;s key takeaways after completing its inquiry into the unreported acquisitions by Google owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft from 2010 to 2019. The commission has <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/09/ftc-report-on-unreported-acquisitions-by-biggest-tech-companies">published</a> its findings over a year after it started the inquiry in February 2020, focusing on 616 transactions valued at over $1 million.&nbsp;</p><p>Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, only mergers and acquisitions exceeding $92 million in value need to be reported to the FTC and the DOJ for antitrust review. The FTC found that the five tech giants made 616 non-reportable transactions over the course of almost a decade and that quite a big chunk actually exceeded the HSR threshold. Of the 616, 94 exceeded the threshold but weren&#39;t reported, because they met certain criteria or because statutory/regulatory exemptions applied to the transaction.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Three more transactions would have exceeded the HSR threshold if the debts or liabilities the acquirer assumed were added to the total amount. Nine additional transactions would&#39;ve also gone above the threshold if the &quot;deferred or contingent compensation to founders and key employees&quot; were added. The FTC didn&#39;t mention any specific acquisition in its report, but <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-15/tech-giants-used-loopholes-to-duck-merger-reviews-ftc-says?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> mentioned Facebook&#39;s acquisition of Giphy last year. <em>Bloomberg</em> says Giphy paid a dividend to investors to lower its assets so that antitrust officials wouldn&#39;t have to be notified. While Facebook didn&#39;t reveal how much it paid for the GIF database, reports say it cost the social network $400 million.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to identifying potential loopholes in HSR reporting, Khan also wants the commission to learn from international peers, since a third of the acquisitions involved foreign companies. Finally, the chairperson wants to scrutinize the use of non-compete clauses in mergers. In more than 75 percent of the transactions investigated, the key personnel of the acquired companies were required to sign non-compete agreements.</p><p>Khan said in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;While the Commission‚Äôs enforcement actions have already focused on how digital platforms can buy their way out of competing, this study highlights the systemic nature of their acquisition strategies..It captures the extent to which these firms have devoted tremendous resources to acquiring start-ups, patent portfolios, and entire teams of technologists ‚Äî and how they were able to do so largely outside of our purview.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ftc-smaller-acquisitions-tech-giants-091043343.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">88ce0b5c-4de7-4d04-98e3-adc89e0248b2</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 09:10:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631781301</ingested><modified>2021-09-16T08:35:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Mergers, Acquisitions & Takeovers]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-03/42420680-5fa4-11ea-adfb-caae360e1fab" width="5340" height="3560" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-03/42420680-5fa4-11ea-adfb-caae360e1fab" width="5340" height="3560" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Andrei Stanescu via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[February 10, 2019 Menlo Park / CA / USA - Group of people taking photos with the Facebook logo (customized for black history month) located outside the Company's main campus in Silicon Valley;]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Group of people taking photos with the Facebook sign customized for black history month]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung begins manufacturing 14-inch 90Hz OLED displays]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Samsung has started manufacturing 90Hz OLED displays that will be used in the latest ASUS laptops, it <a href="http://global.samsungdisplay.com/28691/">announced</a>. The 14-inch, 2,880 x 1,800 16:10 panels were significantly delayed, as Samsung said they&#39;d arrive in March this year when it first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-manufacture-world-first-90hz-oled-laptop-displays-105500083.html">unveiled the technology</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The extra speed compared to 60Hz OLED panels makes these interesting for gaming in particular.  Samsung notes that the OLED tech creates less blurring on motion than LCD panels and claims you&#39;ll see clearer movement on a 90Hz OLED display than you would on a 120Hz LCD model. In theory, that could mean relatively sharp gaming on a display that&#39;s not as taxing for your computer&#39;s GPU.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The OLED screens deliver better color too, with 100 percent DCI-P3 coverage that beats most LCD models. They also offer deeper blacks, faster response times and better viewing angles. The drawback compared to LCDs is a lack of brightness and lower energy efficiency when viewing bright content. The screens are set to arrive on ASUS&#39;s Zenbook 14X Pro and Vivobook Pro 14X models announced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-oled-notebooks-proart-zenbook-vivobook-160009335.html">earlier this month</a>.

The free, open source virtual modular synth with thousands of modules to choose from (including recreations of popular physical ones) gave many of us a way to explore the world of Eurorack without dropping thousands of dollars on gear. And now, after a long and arduous road ‚Äî VCV Rack 2 is nearly upon us.&nbsp;</p><p>When it launches in November VCV Rack 2 will include a complete redesign of the UI, including a dark mode and a greatly improved browser. That last part is huge because, the library of nearly 2,700 modules is overwhelming to say the least. And chances are you&#39;re going to end up downloading <em>a lot</em> of them. Here you can filter by category or even just highlight your most used modules. And you can easily import, export and duplicate module selections.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="19b63b63a266436aaa718c2116ee1edb"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uk1yg9ib_oI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>The big news though, is the introduction of a proper VST plugin so you can use VCV Rack in Ableton, Logic, or whatever your DAW of choice might be. Squeezing the power of an entire virtual modular synth into a plugin is no easy task. It took time and effort and VCV along with its founder Andrew Belt are hoping that some people will be willing to pay to keep the project alive. So, while VCV Rack will continue to be a free and open source application, the VST plugin will be exclusive to the Studio Edition and will include proper technical support (not just forums).&nbsp;</p><p>VCV Rack 2 will be available in November for an introductory price of $99. Eventually that will go up to $149, but even then it&#39;s still cheaper than many virtual instruments with far less flexibility.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/vcv-rack-2-virtual-eurorack-synth-november-vst-plugin-superbooth-223810427.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6b5749c2-5f9e-4960-bc64-4fd666b9ddd4</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien,Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 22:38:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631753878</ingested><modified>2021-09-16T00:58:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/4309dde0-1669-11ec-bef1-20ab8366caed" width="2000" height="1115" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/4309dde0-1669-11ec-bef1-20ab8366caed" width="2000" height="1115" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[VCV]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[VCV Rack 2 Studio Edition]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[VCV Rack 2 Studio Edition]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[HomePod mini update lets it become your default Apple TV speaker]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple didn&#39;t even touch on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-homepod-mini-review-140030652.html">HomePod line</a> during its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-event-supercut-201538409.html">iPhone 13 event</a>, but that doesn&#39;t mean the smart speakers will go untouched this fall. <em>9to5Mac</em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/15/everything-new-homepod-software-version-15/">notes</a> an impending version 15 update will make the HomePod considerably more useful, particularly if it&#39;s part of a larger smart home. To start, you can set two or more HomePod minis as your default speakers for an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-4k-review-2021-new-siri-remote-150054255.html">Apple TV 4K</a>. You won&#39;t have to specify them when it&#39;s time to sit down for a movie. They won&#39;t exactly produce thunderous audio, but they could save you from buying separate smart speakers or a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-beam-2nd-generation-home-theater-soundbar-130053922.html">pricier soundbar</a>.</p><p>You also won&#39;t have to approach your HomePod to use Siri. The update enables Siri voice control through supporting HomeKit accessories. While Apple&#39;s smart home ecosystem isn&#39;t nearly as large as Amazon&#39;s or Google&#39;s, that could be handy if you want to quickly turn the lights on.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Other improvements are subtler, but could be valuable in the right circumstances. You can ask Siri to turn on your Apple TV, play a title and control playback. You&#39;ll automatically see playback controls on your lock screen if a nearby HomePod mini is playing music. You&#39;ll get notifications if compatible <a href="https://www.engadget.com/logitech-circle-view-doorbell-homekit-secure-video-110146629.html">HomeKit Secure Video</a> cameras and doorbells detect a package at your door. This is also a big update if you&#39;ve ever woken your partner or neighbors by mistake ‚Äî Siri will adjust its speaking volume based on both the room and your own voice, and you can specify a lower bass level to avoid irritating people in the apartment below.</p><p>Apple didn&#39;t outline the HomePod update&#39;s release timing, but it&#39;s likely to arrive on September 20th alongside <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-will-be-available-to-download-on-september-20th-182701197.html">iOS 15 and watchOS 8</a>.

The release notes don&#39;t indicate support will be available with version 15, so you&#39;ll likely have to wait for a follow-up patch to experience more immersive HomePod sound.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/homepod-15-update-apple-tv-homekit-213444115.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d3fe35c2-40be-4e39-abab-19e6dd2bfb64</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 21:34:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631738640</ingested><modified>2021-09-15T20:44:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/47acf9c0-1661-11ec-9b0f-ec0cc09f0ca9" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/47acf9c0-1661-11ec-9b0f-ec0cc09f0ca9" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Ingraham/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple HomePod mini smart speaker]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple HomePod mini smart speaker]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Battlefield 2042' delayed by almost a month to November 19th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/battlefield-2042-video-details-151958457.html"><em>Battlefield 2042</em></a>, the next entry in EA&#39;s long-running first-person shooter series, has been delayed.

Inspiration4 was paid for a billionaire who was relatively unknown before this: Shift4 Payments CEO Jared Isaacman. He&#39;s bringing three more people with him, and none of them are trained astronauts or have been to space before.</p><p>Isaacman, who&#39;s an experienced pilot,  will be the mission&#39;s commander, while Hayley Arceneaux will be its medical officer. Arceneaux is a physician assistant at St. Jude Children&#39;s Research Hospital who had cancer herself as a child. According to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/09/spacex-inspiration4-private-crew/620056/"><em>The Atlantic</em></a>, one of the goals for this mission is to <a href="https://www.stjude.org/get-involved/other-ways/inspiration4.html">raise $200 million</a> for the hospital, and Isaacman wanted to bring one of its employees.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Geoscience professor and former NASA astronaut program finalist Sian Proctor will serve as the mission pilot. Finally, data engineer and Iraq War veteran Chris Sembroski will serve as mission specialist. Proctor won an online competition organized by Isaacman, while Sembroski got his slot from a friend who won a raffle for a seat on the mission.</p><p>The team trained together for six months and <a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1437274001898754053">completed</a> a full rehearsal of launch day activities on September 13th. They&#39;ll spend three days orbiting our planet aboard SpaceX&#39;s Crew Dragon capsule that will blast off on top of a Falcon 9 rocket.

You can simply launch a standard web search to ignore these de facto ads, but this does mean you&#39;ll want to look carefully at some links before you click them.</p><div id="b25594a3758041c4861c16b2293a69e0"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rvf1ND7i2RM?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/mozilla-firefox-suggest-190800805.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5e01458a-4286-49e2-bd62-77199c4bd7c1</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 19:08:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631732883</ingested><modified>2021-09-15T19:08:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d663d940-1652-11ec-aef7-1560d5940667" width="3474" height="2316" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d663d940-1652-11ec-aef7-1560d5940667" width="3474" height="2316" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Thomas Trutschel via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BERLIN, GERMANY - APRIL 22: The logo of the free Webbrowser Mozilla Firefox is shown on the display of a smartphone on April 22, 2020 in Berlin, Germany.

Captain America, the Hulk, War Machine and Captain Marvel are all involved in it to some extent. But the portrayal has always tilted toward the positive due to Hollywood‚Äôs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military-entertainment_complex">long-standing partnership with the US military</a>. This week‚Äôs <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Disney+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:What If&#x002026;?" href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/x9NDA5"><em>What If‚Ä¶?</em></a> uses the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-070123812.html">freedom offered by animation</a> to go a little dark on the subject and show us how easily the business of war could have overrun the narrative.</p><p>The point of divergence this time around is that Erik Killmonger is apparently assigned to an undercover mission with the Ten Rings and, in the process, ends up saving Tony Stark‚Äôs life. So Tony is never injured and forced to build the Iron Man suit, instead continuing his war profiteering ways ‚Äî though now with a new BFF at his side. Instead of becoming someone who buries himself in his work (and builds a literal suit of armor to protect himself) Tony instead lashes out, with Killmonger all-too-ready to point him in the direction of taking down Wakanda.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="1c5c1904620749e8ba3ab1d631240eee"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-6vAzA67d3I?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>This pulls Wakanda into the narrative a lot sooner than its main-timeline debut in 2006‚Äôs <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Disney+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Captain America: Civil War" href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/LP22Oj"><em>Captain America: Civil War</em></a>. The country‚Äôs isolationist policy has been used as the retcon for why we never heard a peep from Wakanda sooner but it quickly comes to the forefront here, in lieu of all the stories that spun out of the initial attack on Stark: the conflict with Obadiah Stane and Tony‚Äôs palladium poisoning in the first two Iron Man films, and then later the attack on Sokovia in <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Disney+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Age of Ultron" href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/jWmmJe"><em>Age of Ultron</em></a> and Baron Zemo‚Äôs revenge scheme in <em>Civil War</em>. General Ross even makes an appearance here, casting doubt on whether the events of <em>The Incredible Hulk</em> even still happened the same way. Instead of being introduced to Wakanda through a UN peace conference, instead they‚Äôre a country on the defensive against a horde of mechanical forces.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8effbed0-1651-11ec-9fef-a5bc9a33d34e" style="height:876;width:1874;" alt="Stark Industries&#39; robot army" data-uuid="774b25cf-7cd0-3bf5-a39a-d06927e537ca"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Marvel Studios</div></figure><p>The episode makes it quickly apparent how much of the MCU was dependent on Tony Stark‚Äôs participation, though not in a feel-good George Bailey <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:It&#x002019;s a Wonderful Life" href="https://amzn.to/3kg7G1D"><em>It‚Äôs a Wonderful Life</em></a> way. In <em>Civil War</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>Vision points out that the power shown since Iron Man‚Äôs debut invites challenge. Here, we end up in a major conflict anyway, showing that the aggressive energy that created the MCU‚Äôs Heroic Age already existed, spurred on by advancing technology. Without superheroes to pick up the banner, it‚Äôs the military that becomes the beneficiary of all that power.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f8712750-1651-11ec-9fdf-c5fe8bd51f05" style="height:868;width:1886;" alt="Above shot of a hangar full of robots" data-uuid="76db762d-c163-3d46-90c1-d823cd44ab2d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Marvel Studios</div></figure><p>However, the military is a system as much as it is people, and there‚Äôs a weird sense throughout the episode that responsibility isn&#39;t in any particular person‚Äôs hands, even Eric Killmonger‚Äôs. We‚Äôre clearly shown where he‚Äôs pulling the strings, but characters like Tony Stark and General Ross are all too willing to be tugged along. But even they don‚Äôt feel fully in control of what happens. The conflict just escalates quickly and disproportionately in the episode‚Äôs half-hour runtime, perhaps a victim of the show‚Äôs need for expedited storytelling.</p><p>It‚Äôs no coincidence that the war that started the MCU was the conflict in Afghanistan, though it is happenstance that this episode aired only a month after the US brought its involvement to a messy close. It‚Äôs been a way of life for so long that it‚Äôs easy to feel swept away by the whole thing, especially if you were born after 9/11. This episode reinforces the MCU‚Äôs role as escapism during this era, a place where we could move beyond all this ugly terrestrial conflict and address more cosmic issues. By removing the heroes from the equation, the MCU becomes a grim mirror of the mindset we‚Äôve been living in for two decades.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/marvel-what-if-episode-six-190030466.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">271b584d-d92a-45c0-bfd4-5a53f1589ad6</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 19:00:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631730765</ingested><modified>2021-09-15T18:32:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a6f10c60-1651-11ec-a17e-1852e650b414" width="1713" height="870" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a6f10c60-1651-11ec-a17e-1852e650b414" width="1713" height="870" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Marvel Studios]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Erik Killmonger]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Marvel's What If?]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Unicode 14.0 adds 37 new emoji, including 'melting face' and 'beans']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following a <a href="https://blog.emojipedia.org/what-the-2021-unicode-delay-means-for-emoji/"><ins>pandemic-related delay</ins></a>, the Unicode Consortium has <a href="http://blog.unicode.org/2021/09/announcing-unicode-standard-version-140.html"><ins>finalized Unicode 14.0</ins></a>.
