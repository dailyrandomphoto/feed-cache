The JBL Quantum Stream is a dual-condenser mic with two selectable voice pickup patterns. One of those patterns gives you a way to make sure the mic focuses on your voice, while the other was designed to capture everyone&#39;s voice, in case you&#39;re in a group call or recording a podcast with someone. The Quantum Stream also has a mute button and controls that allow you to adjust your voice volume directly on the device itself. It will set you back $100 when it makes its way to <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:JBL&#39;s website" href="https://fave.co/3eP7ToN">JBL&#39;s website</a> and to retailers this spring.</p><p>The company has also introduced its first true wireless earbuds for the line, the JBL Quantum TWS. They have Adaptive Noise Cancelling and ambient aware features, giving them the capability to automatically adjust how much noise gets in based on your surroundings. They have JBL&#39;s QuantumSURROUND feature that enables spatial surround sound, as well, along with support for various voice assistants. The wireless earbuds can connect to a mobile device via Bluetooth, but they also come with a USB-C dongle for low latency connection to PCs, the PlayStation and the Nintendo Switch. When it comes to battery life, the earbuds can last for eight hours, with the charging case providing 16 additional hours. The earbuds will also be available this spring and will sell for $150.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e373a160-6d50-11ec-bbfe-bd75befe5aa5" alt="JBL" data-uuid="65343a57-9f86-3696-b754-4c53aa57676d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">JBL</div></figure><p>Finally, JBL has added three new over-ear headsets to the line: the JBL Quantum 910, JBL Quantum 810 and JBL Quantum 610. The Quantum 910 comes with the JBL QuantumSPHERE 360, which is the brand&#39;s proprietary head-tracking technology, making it the first wireless device with the feature. Both the Quantum 910 and 810 headsets have Active Noise Cancelling and can connect to consoles, PCs and mobile via 2.4G wireless or Bluetooth. Meanwhile, the 610 only has 2.4G wireless connection, though it has the longest battery life of the three and can last for up to 40 hours. The Quantum 910 will sell for $250, the Quantum 810 for $200 and the Quantum 610 for $150 when they come out this spring.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/jbl-usb-quantum-stream-gaming-mic-130057253.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">454ecb46-e677-4e7d-964b-b352886dfe74</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 13:00:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641302787</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T13:26:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/05eb43a0-6d48-11ec-bf7e-0f92ea91daa4" width="1600" height="1074" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/05eb43a0-6d48-11ec-bf7e-0f92ea91daa4" width="1600" height="1074" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[JBL]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[JBL]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[JBL]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Harman would like to sell you some $1,000 headphones]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Not so long ago, the internet was debating what the folks at Apple were thinking charging $549 for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/airpods-max-review-143019326.html">AirPods Max</a>. At CES 2022, luxury audio brand <a href="https://www.marklevinson.com/">Mark Levinson</a> would like a word. The Harman-owned company (which also owns AKG, JBL and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Harman Kardon" href="https://fave.co/3sUTM9L">Harman Kardon</a>, and is itself <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-11-14-samsung-buys-harmon-auto-audio.html">a Samsung subsidiary</a>) mostly known for its high-end home and car audio systems has announced its first wireless headphones: the No. 5909. While they offer everything you&#39;d expect from a premium set, they have a nearly $1,000 price tag that only a select few might commit to.&nbsp;</p><p>The over-ear No. 5909 packs 40mm Beryllium drivers &quot;expertly tuned to the Harman curve.&quot; The company explains that &quot;the Harman curve&quot; is acoustic response that it says has taken decades of research to construct. The result here is &quot;incredible acoustic performance&quot; in a set of &quot;reference class&quot; wireless headphones. Mark Levinson says that audio performance meets the guidelines for Hi-Res Audio certification thanks to 24-bit/96kHz signal processing and 40kHz acoustic response. The No. 5909 supports LDAC, AAC and aptX Adaptive wireless codecs via Bluetooth 5.1.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Mark Levinson promises you&#39;ll hear details you haven&#39;t before, like &quot;the slightest breath an artist takes&quot; or &quot;a hidden harmony.&quot; The company explains that the same &quot;world-class sound engineers&quot; that built the luxury brand&#39;s amps, turntables and streaming players are behind the tuning of the ultra pricey No. 5909.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9a00d660-6cfb-11ec-adeb-cb245e3c0565" alt="Mark Levinson No. 5909" data-uuid="f771396c-63a4-3ce1-aa37-5d997b52d8ba"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mark Levinson/Harman</div></figure><p>Sound quality isn&#39;t the only consideration though. The No. 5909 has adaptive active noise cancellation (ANC) with three modes &quot;for premium sound isolation&quot; and an Ambient Aware feature that lets you tune into your surroundings as needed. The company also packed in four microphones for calls that are equipped with a so-called Smart Wind Adaption feature. The materials used to make the headphones are also better than the mostly plastic sets we typically see. The No. 5909 is built with an aluminum frame, painted metallic earcups, leather headband and replaceable leather ear cushions. An included hard shell travel case comes stocked with a USB-C charging cable, USB-C to USB-A adaptor, two USB-C to 3.5mm cables, 3.5mm to 6.3mm adaptor, airplane adaptor and a polishing cloth. Basically, it&#39;s everything you&#39;d need to use the headphones on any setup — wired, wireless or while traveling.&nbsp;</p><p>Mark Levinson says you can expect up to 30 hours of use with adaptive ANC active and up to 34 hours with the feature disabled. A quick-charge feature will give you up to six hours of play time in 15 minutes. Via an app for Android and iOS, you&#39;ll get some control over the headphones, but the company didn&#39;t go into specifics there.&nbsp;</p><p>The No. 5909 will be available in black, pewter and red color options starting today for $999.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/mark-levinson-5909-headphones-announced-price-specs-130056543.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f15e4641-f202-40a5-bdec-e72b9a1736da</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 13:00:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641302864</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T13:27:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/63064510-6cd2-11ec-bffb-5e01fa94904b" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/63064510-6cd2-11ec-bffb-5e01fa94904b" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[JBL]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[JBL Mark Levinson 5909 headphones]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[JBL Mark Levinson 5909]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[JBL expands its true wireless lineup with three new ANC models]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It wouldn&#39;t be CES without a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-07-jbl-live-headphones-ces-2019.html">barrage of audio devices</a> from JBL. Part of that annual deluge is <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:a collection of true wireless earbuds" href="https://fave.co/3EUZfQ6">a collection of true wireless earbuds</a>, and this year is no different. Today, the company is debuting three new models with active noise cancellation (ANC) and at least seven hours of battery life. Each one is also at least IPX5 rated for water and sweat resistance, so all three can stand up to your workouts in the new year.&nbsp;</p><p>First, the JBL Live Pro 2 offers an AirPod-like stickbud design and adaptive ANC. This model also has a &quot;smart ambient&quot; mode that allows you to adjust the amount of background noise the earbuds let in. JBL says you can enable hands-free voice control through its headphones app for either Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant while on-board touch controls are available for core functions. Six microphones &quot;deliver superior call quality,&quot; according to JBL, by isolating noise (and wind) and focusing on your voice. The company says you can expect up to 10 hours of use on the earbuds themselves with another 30 hours in the case. That case supports wireless charging via Qi-compatible accessories and 15 minutes will give you four hours of playback.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/19fa1560-6cd0-11ec-a6bd-2944402a486e" alt="JBL Live Free 2" data-uuid="ba25d005-84c0-375b-b310-0e97bfe9e345"><figcaption>JBL Live Free 2</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">JBL</div></figure><p>For those who prefer a more &quot;traditional&quot; true wireless earbud design, the tiny JBL Live Free 2 might be more your speed. Like the Live Pro 2, they feature adaptive noise cancelling, smart ambient mode, hands-free voice control, a six-mic setup for calls and on-board touch controls. The main difference, aside from the design, is that the Live Free 2 only lasts seven hours on a charge with an additional 28 hours in the case. There&#39;s no quick charge mode and wireless charging isn&#39;t on the spec sheet here. However, the Live Free 2 is the most compact of the three new models when it comes to overall earbud size.</p><p>Lastly, The JBL Reflect Aero is built specifically for workouts, complete with an adjustable ear fin to hold them in place. They&#39;re IP68 rated, so they offer protection from dust in addition to improved water proofing over the other two models. Adaptive ANC, smart ambient mode, hands-free voice control, on-board touch controls and six microphones to handle calls are all part of the features list. JBL says you can expect up to eight hours of battery life on the earbuds with two full charges in the case (16 hours). There&#39;s no mention of quick charging or compatibility with Qi accessories here, so if that&#39;s a dealbreaker, you&#39;ll have to live with the stickbud Live Pro 2 out of the company&#39;s trio of new devices.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/568a3be0-6cd0-11ec-af79-ad5b36edeb13" alt="JBL Reflect Aero" data-uuid="477121f8-e5b7-3bbd-904b-6b3796d40589"><figcaption>JBL Reflect Aero</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">JBL</div></figure><p>The Live Pro 2, Live Free 2 and Reflect Aero are all priced at $149.95 and are scheduled to arrive sometime this spring.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/jbl-true-wireless-earbuds-lineup-ces-2022-130052913.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0929dc39-a3bb-4c26-85ee-72f0944cef00</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 13:00:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641302966</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T13:29:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e5cd4d70-6ccf-11ec-b5fe-d2cf76d8fb60" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e5cd4d70-6ccf-11ec-b5fe-d2cf76d8fb60" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[JBL]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[JBL Live Pro 2]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[JBL Live Pro 2]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes found guilty of defrauding investors]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a months-long trial, and a jury that was eventually deadlocked on several of 11 total charges, Elizabeth Homes, the former CEO and founder of Theranos, has been found guilty on four charges.</p><p>Holmes, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/elizabeth-holmes-trial-testimony.html">testified</a> during the trial, said she hadn’t intended to mislead the public or investors, and had been advised to protect the company’s “trade secrets.” The founder, who will likely appeal the charges, could face up to 20 years in prison, though it&#39;s not yet clear when she will be sentenced.</p><p>The tale of Elizabeth Holmes captured the fascination of many Silicon Valley watchers, leading to a best-selling book, several podcast series and an HBO documentary.

A number of its <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:portable speaker lines" href="https://fave.co/3ePFaQO">portable speaker lines</a> are getting an update, including redesigned bodies and internals, as well as a pretty tasty exclusive model just for <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Sam&#x002019;s Club members" href="https://fave.co/3zpy0fp">Sam’s Club members</a>.</p><p>First on the line is the JBL Boombox 3 (pictured) which gets a new three-way speaker system, including a racetrack-shaped subwoofer, two mid-range drivers and two tweeters. JBL promises that you&#39;ll get deeper bass, more intense clarity and even more powerful sound than before, as well as 24 hours of playtime on a single charge. It’s IP67 water-and-dust-proof, and can be used as a portable battery for other devices. It’ll arrive this summer, and will set you back $500.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/ac7fe6b0-6d4f-11ec-befe-8f6fa38e47c6" alt=" JBL Pulse 5" data-uuid="a2629d88-d244-350f-8143-beb2515d1b3a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">JBL</div></figure><p>Meanwhile, the JBL Pulse 5 is getting a refreshed design with a larger passive radiator and acoustic volume for deeper bass, as well as a refined woofer for better mid-low frequency sound. It’ll run for up to 12 hours of play on a single charge, and is IP67 water-and-dust-proof making it useful for trips to the beach and pool. Plus, with the vibrant LED light show and ability to pair any number of companion speakers through JBL PartyBoost, you could easily use this to run your own music and light show during a balmy evening. It’ll arrive this summer, priced at $250.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/2b959f80-6d50-11ec-a8fe-bdf9bbc3669c" alt="JBL PartyBoxes" data-uuid="52ea7948-04eb-38bb-b871-3257b0c55b6e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">JBL</div></figure><p>The JBL PartyBox is getting two different variations, the PartyBox Encore (pictured, right), as well as the PartyBox Encore Essential (left). The former, which is exclusive to Sam’s Club, packs a 100W speaker and a built-in lightshow that syncs to the music you’re playing. As you can see from the image, it’s also equipped with two wireless microphones, enabling that friend who’s really into karaoke to do their thing all night long. Naturally, it’s got IPX4 splashproof design, Bluetooth v5.1 and playback from USB and aux-in, ensuring you’ll have a great night whatever you’re doing. You’ll be able to pick one up from Sam’s Club in the summer for $400.</p><p>The Essential version, meanwhile, offers the same basic 100W speaker and lightshow, but in a smaller, more portable body. The battery will run to six hours, and you can connect Bluetooth, USB or aux-in to get the sound out, plus there’s a single wired microphone input for that karaoke friend you like a little less. This model will be available in March for $300.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/jbl-summer-2022-portable-speaker-collection-update-130006329.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bf76754b-ea2c-4163-9f3a-a300365b2e53</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 13:00:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641303062</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T13:31:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/63f33550-6d4f-11ec-aae6-49d57e33ef0e" width="1280" height="800" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/63f33550-6d4f-11ec-aae6-49d57e33ef0e" width="1280" height="800" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[JBL]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[New version of the JBL Boombox in black.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[JBL Boombox 3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Roland's AeroCaster VRC-01 is a wireless video mixer for streamers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Roland has been making inroads into the Pro AV space for a while. The <a href="https://proav.roland.com/global/products/aerocaster/features/">AeroCaster VRC-01</a> is its latest hardware offering in this space with a focus on streamers and creators. The mini video-switching console operates almost entirely wirelessly and allows a multi-source video setup using just phones and laptops over WiFi or cellular.&nbsp;</p><p>You&#39;ll need to connect the AeroCaster to an iPad to run the main mixing software, but all the other video inputs are wireless via either Roland&#39;s own AeroCaster Camera mobile app or laptop users can remote screen share via Chrome. In short, if you ever wanted to make a multi-cam podcast or music video, but don&#39;t want the headache of several dedicated cameras, AeroCaster will let you do it with the phones you might already have.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Roland has some pretty strong credentials in this space thanks to its V-series of <a href="https://proav.roland.com/global/categories/video_switchers/">Pro AV video switchers</a> and mixers. The VRC-01 appears to be a more consumer-friendly option with a focus on Twitchers and YouTubers (though you can also stream to Facebook Live or any RTMP channel too). From the console you can switch cameras and mix audio in real time. There are two combo XLR inputs for pro-grade microphones or TRS/phone input along with some simple audio effects such as reverb and lip sync delay.</p><p>A lot of the above functionality was already possible via some of Roland&#39;s higher-end gear and its AeroCaster Switcher app, but the VRC-01 and new companion iPad app seem more streamlined and accessible. In many ways, it feels like the video-friendly sibling to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rolands-go-mixer-pro-x-studio-in-your-pocket-160021589.html">GO:Mixer Pro X</a> with both offering &quot;prosumer&quot; features in a smaller, more affordable package.&nbsp;</p><p>The VRC-O1 will be available in March and cost $295.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/roland-aero-caster-vrc-01-wireless-streaming-setup-112113739.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4d63a088-4795-49a7-a7f3-9b6baa20e648</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 11:21:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641295277</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T11:21:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b49c5890-6d4c-11ec-bfff-67768332a6ca" width="8688" height="5792" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b49c5890-6d4c-11ec-bfff-67768332a6ca" width="8688" height="5792" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Roland]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Roland AeroCaster VC-01]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Roland AeroCaster VC-01]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ford is doubling F-150 Lightning production to 150,000 vehicles a year]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ford is making new efforts to double production capacity of the F-150 Lightning electric pickup to 150,000 vehicles per year, the company announced. That follows <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-stops-f-150-lightning-reservations-at-200000-192434385.html">news from December</a> that it capped pre-orders at 200,000 units, with CEO Jim Farley saying &quot;we are completely oversubscribed with our battery electric vehicles.&quot; In addition, the company will start inviting the first group of reservation holders to place orders for the F-150 Lightning starting on Thursday, January 6th.&nbsp;</p><p>To boost production, Ford said it created a small task force of employees from &quot;manufacturing, purchasing, strategy, product development, and capacity planning&quot; to find ways to accelerate production. It&#39;s also working with key suppliers &quot;to find ways to increase capacity of electric vehicle parts, including battery cells, battery trays and electric drive systems,&quot; the company said in a press release.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company noted that the F-150 Lightning is now in the the final pre-build phase before moving into mass production for retail and commercial customers, with deliveries starting this spring. The aim is to test production vehicles over a million miles or so in real-world customer conditions.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/7d856c00-6d2b-11ec-a224-4cbc90225d4d" alt="One year after Ford confirmed construction of the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Mich., the first Ford F-150 Lightning pre-production units begin leaving the factory.

The automaker indicated that later pre-order holders might have to wait for vehicles from the following model year. (Ford also noted that over 75 percent of reservation holders were new to the brand.)&nbsp;</p><p>Deliveries of the 2022 F-150 Lightning pickup will begin in spring of 2022 with a starting MSRP of $39,974 before any available tax incentives. However, <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/12/30/ford-dealers-taking-advantage-strong-demand-f150-lightning-marking-up/">some reports indicate</a> that some dealers may be dinging customers up to $30,000 extra to be among the first to receive their vehicles.&nbsp;</p><p>Ford recently announced that it would triple production of the Mustang Mach-E to reach 200,000 units per year by 2023, with plans to have the &quot;global capacity to produce 600,000 BEVs annually.&quot; To do that, it&#39;s building what it calls its &quot;most advanced, most efficient auto production facility in its 118-year history in Tennessee,&quot; along with three battery plants built in collaboration with SK Innovation. All of that represents a total $11.4 billion investment with 11,000 new jobs created.</p><p>The F-150 Lightning is eligible for a full $7,500 US BEV tax credit as of today (along with any state subsidies), but Ford is expected to hit its 200,000 vehicle eligibility limit later this year. At that point, the credit will gradually be phased out unless <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-trade-agency-backs-proposed-ev-tax-credit-despite-mexicos-objections-2021-12-03/">new legislation is passed</a> that would change the rules.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ford-doubling-f-150-lightning-production-150000-vehicles-per-year-110034432.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">069f160e-1976-4fdc-a248-5d92f1c92c79</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 11:00:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641284205</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T08:16:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/3bdd2810-6d30-11ec-bfcb-e6d1849eb349" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/3bdd2810-6d30-11ec-bfcb-e6d1849eb349" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ford]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[One year after Ford confirmed construction of the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Mich., the first Ford F-150 Lightning pre-production units begin leaving the factory.

With a pressure sensor, OLED display and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-05-oral-b-io-electric-toothbrush-ai-app.html?guccounter=1">smartphone coaching</a>, the iO Series 9 is, or was, the most luxurious way to clean your teeth. Today, however, the company has decided to broaden out the range of iO toothbrushes with both an even higher-end flagship above, and some more affordable models below.</p><div id="62934d6c91ba4c498b7ba7493920378d"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9gLqcbD-skI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The new flagship is the iO10 with iOSense, which the company is calling the “ultimate oral health coach,” which eliminates one of the biggest problems with the iO9. With the existing model, the pressure warning light — which tells you if you’re pressing too hard on your teeth — and countdown timer is on the brush itself. That makes it very hard to tell when you’re done unless you’re staring intently at yourself in a mirror.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The iO10, meanwhile, duplicates that information on its new beefier charging base, with a digital countdown timer, pressure warnings and even a ring of lights that correspond to the six areas of our mouths. That means you don’t have to open your phone every single time you brush in order to check all of your teeth are getting an equal amount of attention. Of course, it does mean that you’ll need to have your charger plugged in your bathroom at all times, which might be an issue for some.</p><p>There’s no price for the iO10 as it stands, just an invitation to <a href="https://oralb.com/en-us/join-oralb-iO10-waitlist">sign up for the waitlist</a> for whenever this particular product is available for sale.</p><p>At the same time, the company is launching the iO4 and iO5, which are scaled-down versions of the iO model for various budget buyers. Both come with the smart pressure sensor and the same high-end rotating head as the flagship. But the iO4 only has four brushing modes, and no digital display, while the iO5 has a fifth mode and the benefit of on-board AI and access to live coaching via the app. Those models will be priced at under $100, and will be made available nationwide at some point in 2022.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/oral-b-io-10-2022-102526477.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">aa1c2889-9c33-4215-ba4b-09518a985fb1</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 10:25:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641291930</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T10:25:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e8ece3e0-6d46-11ec-beff-54ac26a4590f" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e8ece3e0-6d46-11ec-beff-54ac26a4590f" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Oral-B]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Promotional image of the Oral-B iO10]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Oral-B iO10]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook suspends Marjorie Taylor Greene's account for a day]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Marjorie Taylor Greene says she also lost access to Facebook, a day after Twitter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-marjorie-taylor-greene-permanent-ban-160838201.html">banned</a> her personal account.

The system is a government database managed by the CDC and the FDA, but it relies on individuals to send in reports of their experience. VAERS&#39; website <a href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/about.html">states</a> that it&#39;s &quot;not designed to determine if a vaccine caused a health problem&quot; and that &quot;additional work and evaluation [of its data] is necessary to further assess a possible safety concern.&quot; Facebook started <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-bans-vaccine-misinformation-193754704.html">taking a tougher stance</a> against misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines and vaccines in general in early 2021.</p><p>Greene is known for questioning the public health measures put into place to prevent the further spread of COVID-19. In addition to opposing vaccine mandates, she also famously <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/greene-masks-house-rules-pandemic/2021/11/01/8b2e8ace-3b46-11ec-a493-51b0252dea0c_story.html">refuses</a> to wear a mask on the House floor and has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/29/us/politics/mask-mandate-fines-greene-clyde.html">racked up</a> tens of thousands of dollars in fines.

Authorities asked the companies for extra time to investigate concerns regarding possible interference with aircraft systems and electronics.&nbsp;</p><p>Both AT&amp;T and Verizon were supposed to to roll out their potentially faster C-band service using newly purchased frequencies back in December, but they <a href="https://www.engadget.com/att-verizon-delay-c-band-5g-due-to-faa-164549890.html">held off</a> on the expansion as requested by the Federal Aviation Administration.

Much <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-c1-g1-series-oled-tvs-ces-2021-133053674.html">like last year</a>, the company is touting improved brightness as one of the main reasons to buy its 2022 sets. That&#39;s because this year LG&#39;s more affordable C2 lineup will also include the &quot;evo&quot; panel technology the company debuted in 2021. Additionally, LG claims its new Alpha 9 Gen 5 AI processors will help further increase luminance through a smarter algorithm and better heat dissipation. Those chips will also improve upscaling performance and offer virtual 7.1.2 surround sound up-mixing, according to LG.</p><p>The new OLEDs will ship with the latest version of LG’s webOS operating system. The updated software adds support for individual profiles, allowing you to customize the menu for quick access to your favorite streaming services. By creating a profile, you’ll also get personalized content recommendations and notifications related to your favorite sports teams.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/d67d76e0-6ce5-11ec-bcb7-577a52a11609" alt="LG G2 Gallery OLED" data-uuid="b777d3de-a545-37c3-b1b2-e60547ae48ae"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">LG</div></figure><p>Another new webOS feature allows you to mirror what you’re watching to a second LG TV. In that way, the company says you watch cable and satellite content on two television sets without an extra set-top box. It’s hard to say how useful that feature will prove since if you have more than one TV in your home, there’s a good chance it’s because your family can’t agree on what to watch in the first place.</p><p>Out of the box, LG’s 2022 TV lineup will support the smart home industry’s new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chip-rebrand-matter-221410229.html">Matter</a> standard, allowing you to control devices lights and thermostats from the TVs. LG also promises a better gaming experience thanks to its updated <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-c1-oled-tv-game-optimizer-google-stadia-135907267.html">Game Optimizer</a>. The company is adding additional feature and preset toggles to the menu to make it easier to access those when you need them. As before, all G2 and C2 sets will support G-Sync, FreeSync and variable refresh rates. HDMI 2.1 also comes standard across the lineup.</p><p>LG has yet to share pricing, but what we do is that the G2 series will consist of 55-, 65- 75-inch models. The company will also offer two new 83- and 97-inch sets. The more affordable C2 series will consist of six models total, including a new 42-inch size LG says is a great fit for console and PC gaming. The rest of the C2 lineup consists of 48-, 55-, 65-, 77- and 83-inch sets. LG also plans to expand its QNED TV lineup for 2022. Those sets will include the company’s Quantum Dot NanoCell technology and offer 100 percent color volume.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lg-oled-g2-c2-annoucement-020045964.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">db5afdf4-4fd4-45ae-a7f5-3f004b6fbe9f</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 02:00:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641301797</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T13:10:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/885ba1b0-6d5f-11ec-a2fd-55ef9d807fcd" width="1311" height="807" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/885ba1b0-6d5f-11ec-a2fd-55ef9d807fcd" width="1311" height="807" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LG]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LG OLED evo TVs - 2022]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[LG OLED evo TVs - 2022]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Galaxy S21 FE hands-on: Last year’s flagship without the frills]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At CES 2022 today, Samsung has finally unveiled the Galaxy S21 FE (or “Fan Edition”) phone. This is basically a tweaked version of <a href="http://engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-camera-samples-screen-specs-160033680.html">last year’s S21</a> that the company is <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s21-5g/buy/galaxy-s21-ultra-5g-128gb-unlocked-sm-g998uzkaxaa/?link=galaxy-s21-ultra-5g/">selling</a> for $700 starting January 11th. That’s $100 less than the regular S21, and for the price this year’s model offers the same 5nm processors, same 120Hz refresh rate (in a slightly bigger screen) and a similar triple camera system. The S21 FE has a larger battery, though, and comes with Android 12. We’ll have a full review coming soon, but based on our brief hands-on with a test unit, the S21 FE appears to be a well-rounded device.</p><p>At first glance, the S21 FE isn’t as eye-catching as last year’s flagship. While it features a similar bump on the top left corner for its camera module, its housing doesn’t have a shiny finish like the original S21. I prefer the previous style — this one’s kind of bland. But the S21 FE feels sturdy and its matte finish helps it resist fingerprints, too</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The S21 FE is also available in a different set of colors than the original: This time, you get to choose from lavender, olive, silver or black (which is the color of my sample unit).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9efbe500-6ced-11ec-bf9d-5248e03722f3" style="height:1200;width:1800;" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S21 FE in black held in mid-air with its right side facing the camera." data-uuid="f8b8a5af-f6c5-3a63-a3f6-a14fd526e3f7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>At 177 grams (or 6.2 ounces), the S21 FE is slightly heavier than the S21, which is reasonable given the newer model’s bigger 6.4-inch screen. The display still runs at Full HD+, and looks bright and sharp. But don’t expect S Pen support here like you’d get on the S21+ and Ultra. Like the S21, the Fan Edition doesn’t support Samsung’s stylus.</p><p>Aside from size, the biggest difference between the S21 FE and the original model lie in their rear cameras. While both versions have a similar 12-megapixel main camera with a f/1.8 aperture, the FE’s ultra-wide lens has a slightly wider field of view of 123 degrees. Also, the FE’s telephoto camera uses an 8-megapixel sensor while the S21’s is 64 megapixels, though they both offer 30x Space Zoom.</p><p>During my hands-on period with the S21 FE, I haven’t really put its cameras through rigorous testing and so far I haven’t noticed any major issues with picture quality. Images came out colorful and clear. Oddly, the FE’s front camera is 32 megapixels sharp while the original’s is just 10 megapixels. The selfies I’ve shot with it so far were indeed tack sharp and individual strands of my damaged hair were painfully clear.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f9bf8880-6cf1-11ec-9eef-3a2b6cbfba70" style="height:1200;width:1800;" alt="A close up of the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE&#39;s triple camera system on its back.." data-uuid="87a3e5a0-a4f4-39d5-96ab-f77cdbc808fd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>These tweaks are similar to how <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s20-fan-edition-5g-700-dollars-price-specs-140005996.html">the S20 FE</a> varied from the S20. Samsung said it sold 10 million units of the S20 FE in just over a year since the phone’s launch in Q4 2020, making that model one of the best-selling Galaxy smartphones over the past year.</p><p>Since this is just a brief hands-on and not our full review, I can&#39;t yet tell how the S21 FE will stack up to other phones in this price range. But already it faces stiff competition from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro-review-specs-camera-samples-battery-test-160014200.html">the Pixel 6</a>, which offers excellent cameras and software at the same cost, although it has a polarizing design.</p><p>Though the combination of features for the relatively lower price might make the S21 FE an appealing phone to many Samsung fans, the company picked an awkward time to release this device. With next-gen flagships presumably on the horizon, Galaxy shoppers might be inclined to wait and see what the company might bring at that launch. Even if you’re <em>dying</em> to buy a new Galaxy S series handset already though, at least wait till we can test the S21 FE out more comprehensively before spending your money.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-specs-price-availability-hands-on-020006151.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">afdc0b0e-3b50-4cf2-9ee3-509f26fe6d31</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 02:00:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641255969</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T00:26:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a3ad4a00-6ceb-11ec-bddf-4611bb3189e0" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a3ad4a00-6ceb-11ec-bddf-4611bb3189e0" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Samsung Galaxy S21 FE in black held in mid-air with its screen facing the camera.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung Galaxy S21 FE]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Withings' Body Scan scale can measure the composition of different parts of your body]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over five years after the release of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-07-02-withings-body-cardio-scale-review.html">Body Cardio</a> (and one <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-31-withings-return-tough-wearable-market.html">flirtation</a> with Nokia later), French company Withings has released its far most technologically advanced connected scale yet, the Body Scan. The big change over the last model is the addition of a handle with four stainless steel electrodes that allows it to measure ECG, segmented body composition (fat/water in your arms, legs and torso) and even esoteric things like nerve activity. All of these features will also make it one of the most expensive scales yet when it arrives to market.&nbsp;</p><p>Withings says it&#39;s the number one US smart scale manufacturer and created the Body Scan &quot;because users are demanding more and more medical and health data and information,&quot; Withings CEO Mathieu Letombe told Engadget in French.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/7f7ee360-6c6d-11ec-87d7-9b16c1c5b796" alt="Withings Body Scan scale" data-uuid="9dd382ce-e4cb-31c6-aa7b-bf67d934c2ee"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Withings</div></figure><p>The new scale is certainly designed to deliver that. Though the design and high-strength tempered glass construction are similar to the previous Body Cardio, it&#39;s loaded with extra sensors that can tell you more than ever about your body. That includes four weight sensors, 14 ITO (Indium tin oxide) electrodes within the platform and four stainless steel electrodes on the new handle. The battery can now go for a year between charges compared to nine months before and it packs a larger, higher-resolution 3.2-inch LCD color display.</p><p>The handle allows safe, low-level electrical signals to pass through your entire body, not just your feet — much as you may have seen on some <a href="https://tanita.eu/rd-545-hr/">advanced gym scales</a>.  To start with, that enables a new 6-lead ECG that can detect heart arrhythmias via two sets of electrodes on each side of the handle and one within the base of the sale. That compares to a single lead on smartwatches, so the Body Scan can deliver more specific results &quot;that can easily be ready by a cardiologist,&quot; said Letombe.&nbsp;</p><p>An embedded algorithm can detect heart patterns associated with atrial fibrillation, showing the results on the display or Withings&#39; Health Mate app. Those can be stored to show trends or &quot;shared with medical professionals from the app,&quot; according to Withings. &quot;Each time you weigh yourself, the scale can deliver that information, thanks to the new handle.&quot;&nbsp;</p><section data-eng-breakout="d559f4121dfb464da5d6712175dbeb58" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/c86a37e0-6c5f-11ec-8ffa-f89ae9fdc719" alt="Withings Body Scan can also record your ECG and assess nerve activity"></section><p>In terms of your weight, Withings claims the Body Scan is accurate to within 0.1 pounds (50 grams) or double the previous model, but that&#39;s just the start of showing your body makeup. It uses multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) to measure whole-body fat and water percentage, visceral fat, muscle and bone mass and extracellular and intracellular water. It can even provide readings for individual body parts, including your torso, arms and legs. All of that allows you to spot things used by health experts and sports professionals like dangerous localized fat or muscle imbalance, Withings said.&nbsp;</p><p>Working with a French company called Impeto Medical, Withings also developed a feature to assess nerve activity. It can track sweat gland activity in the feet (sudomotor function) using a small direct current via the electrodes located in the plate. Impaired function in that regard could show signs of degeneration of small nerve fibers, something that can be corrected with regular activity and a healthy diet.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s a useful function, because there are a lot of chronic health issues like obesity associated with poor nerve function,&quot; Letombe told me. &quot;Impeto creates devices used by neurologists and others doctors that can cost upwards of 10,000 euros, and the Body Scan is a consumer product that, again, does that every time you weigh yourself.&quot; At the same time, Withings will be able to collect nerve activity data from millions of users that could be useful for medical research and patient care.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b3bb3fe0-6c66-11ec-beff-2b499c4f7182" alt="Withings&#39; Body Scan scale has a handle that can measure fat in different parts of your body" data-uuid="56fa5485-428c-3da1-969b-76572f52c5c0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Withings</div></figure><p>Along with the scale, Withings is also introducing (yep) a subscription service, with the price yet to be announced. It will &quot;allow users to connect with medical specialists for advice and consultation while providing clinical teams with data in real-time,&quot; Withings said. It&#39;ll also offer personalized health plans, videos and more covering topics like nutrition, sleep, exercise and stress management to help users with their health goals.&nbsp;</p><p>With the Body Scan, Withings will be offering consumers one of the more advanced health, sports and medical home devices out there — at a price. It&#39;s expected to cost $300 when it arrives to the US and Europe in the second half of 2022 following FDA clearance, or $100 more than the Body Scan&#39;s launch price. That will include three free months of the subscription service, but it&#39;s still big chunk of change for a scale.&nbsp;</p><p>A lot will depend on whether it delivers on all the promised features with reasonable accuracy and if it receives its FDA clearance in a timely manner. That&#39;s not necessarily a given, as it took Withings well over a year to get its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/withings-hybrid-scan-watch-is-set-to-arrive-in-the-us-next-month-135842112.html">ScanWatch cleared</a> by the FDA after it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/withings-scanwatch-hands-on-ifa-2020-070001875.html">first released</a>. The company also had issues with its Pulse Wave Velocity (PVW) heart health feature, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-18-withings-restores-pulse-wave-velocity-eu.html">pulled it</a> in some regions over regulatory concerns.&nbsp;</p><p>Given all that, it&#39;s fairly bold on Withings&#39; part to introduce a scale with even more advanced medical and health functionality. &quot;We think that&#39;s how we can advance a user&#39;s health, not by asking an extra effort, but delivering more targeted information on a product they use every day,&quot; said Letombe.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/withings-latest-scale-has-a-handheld-lead-to-measure-fat-in-different-body-parts-010059582.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f3261398-60ac-4b7b-a5d1-50b7bc062fe6</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 01:00:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641278562</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T06:43:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health Care Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Fitness]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b15b9b10-6c10-11ec-aeef-af44dad92c2c" width="2000" height="1393" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b15b9b10-6c10-11ec-aeef-af44dad92c2c" width="2000" height="1393" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Steve Dent/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Withings' latest scale has a handheld lead to measure fat in different body parts]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Withings' latest scale has a handheld lead to measure fat in different body parts]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Moen's latest faucet can be controlled entirely with gestures]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/moen/"><ins>Moen</ins></a> has pulled back the curtain on its latest faucet, and it&#39;s one that you can control without touching at all.

This year, the major talking point is likely to be the new Nighthawk RAXE300, which sits a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netgear-nighthawk-raxe500-170003612.html">little below the flagship RAXE500</a> in the company’s high-end line. The RAXE300 offers a combined top WiFi speed of 7.8Gbps, plus the benefit of being able to leverage the 6GHz band for faster connectivity. Netgear promises that you’ll get around 2,500 square feet of coverage from the device, plus enough gigabit ethernet ports to connect the rest of your smart home to.</p><p>At the same time, Netgear wanted to take the opportunity to remind the world of the <a href="https://www.netgear.com/home/wifi/mesh/nbk752/">Orbi 5G WiFi 6 Mesh NBK752</a>, which was released late last year. It’s the first 5G tri-band mesh system, which can leverage the 5G modem inside for always-on mobile broadband or as a backup should a standard wired connection fail. Not to mention that, as like many of Netgear’s tri-band products, the backhaul network between the router and its satellite(s) should ensure a stronger, more reliable connection.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Rounding out the list is the Orbi Pro, SXK50, the company’s new mid-range device for small businesses and professional types working from home. It’s a little behind the top-tier SK80, with a cap of 75 concurrent devices, down from 100 for the flagship, as well as a slightly slower WiFi 6 speed, but it’s likely to be an ideal option for some businesses looking for faster and more reliable connectivity.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/5ea6a530-6cb6-11ec-8e7f-92114fa2c34c" style="height:844;width:1501;" alt="Promotional image for Netgear&#39;s new Game Booster add-on" data-uuid="6d8a8fba-dee2-30e8-9ef0-817d2bb54592"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Netgear</div></figure><p>Rounding out the announcements for this year is Game Booster, a paid-for add-on service for Orbi users so that they cam get the same <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netgear-nitehawk-pro-gaming-xr1000-123031339.html">lag-banishing features found in the Nighthawk routers</a>. That includes the ability to track pings and pick the fastest server for specific online games, as well as a built-in ad-and-tracking blocker. Unfortunately, such features will set you back $50 per year after a 30-day free trial, and only if you currently own the Orbi series 750, 850 and 960.</p><p>The Netgear Nighthawk RAXE300 will be available in the first quarter of 2022, and will set you back $400, while the Orbi 5G is already available, priced at $1,099.99.

Holmes faces up to 20 years in prison for defrauding investors in her blood testing startup. The verdict comes after a months-long trial, and more than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-15-elizabeth-holmes-steps-down-ceo-theranos.html"><ins>three years</ins></a> after she was first charged and forced to step down as CEO in 2018.</p><p>Of the 11 total charges, Holmes was found guilty on four: conspiracy to defraud investors and three counts of wire fraud against individual investors. She was found not guilty on four additional charges, including one count of conspiracy to defraud patients, two counts of fraud against investors, and one count of wire fraud stemming from ads Theranos ran in Arizona. The jury was <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/elizabeth-holmes-jury-deadlocked-3-charges-judge-sends-back-deliberate-rcna10770">deadlocked</a> on three other counts of wire fraud and returned no verdict on those charges.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>During the trial, Holmes’ lawyers tried to portray her as a young and inexperienced entrepreneur. “Elizabeth Holmes worked herself to the bone for 15 years trying to make lab testing more affordable,” one of Holmes’ attorneys said in <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-holmes-case-opening-arguments-121138767.html"><ins>opening arguments</ins></a>. “She failed … but failure is not a crime.”</p><p>Holmes, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/elizabeth-holmes-trial-testimony.html"><ins>testified</ins></a> during the trial, said she hadn’t intended to mislead the public or investors, and had been advised to protect the company’s “trade secrets.” As <em>The New York Times </em>pointed out, she “spent much of her testimony arguing that others at Theranos were responsible for the company’s shortcomings.”</p><p>The prosecution alleged that Holmes knew about serious flaws in the company’s technology and hid the issues from investors. Former patients who had received inaccurate blood tests also testified, including an Arizona woman who received an incorrect result for an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/17/theranos-patient-says-blood-test-came-back-with-false-positive-for-hiv.html"><ins>HIV test</ins></a>, and a woman who was misdiagnosed with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/21/theranos-test-gave-false-miscarriage-diagnosis-witness-testifies.html"><ins>a miscarriage</ins></a>.</p><p>Holmes’ story has been a source of widespread fascination even for those outside of Silicon Valley. At its peak, Theranos was valued at more than $9 billion, and had a board of directors filled with former high-ranking <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/theranos-former-board-members-henry-kissinger-george-shultz-james-mattis-2019-3"><ins>government officials</ins></a>, including two former Secretaries of State, Henry Kissinger and George Shultz. Holmes, who had dropped out of Stanford to start the company, regularly appeared on <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/10/26/11620036/theranos-ceo-elizabeth-holmess-five-best-cover-story-appearances"><ins>magazine covers</ins></a> and was often compared to Steve Jobs and other iconic founders. (Holmes herself was reportedly infatuated with Jobs and adopted his signature <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/fashion/elizabeth-holmes-black-turtleneck-theranos.html"><ins>black turtlenecks</ins></a>.)</p><p>Former <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reporter John Carreyrou was the first to report on issues with Theranos’ technology in 2015, and his coverage prompted multiple investigations and lawsuits that ultimately resulted in criminal charges for Holmes and former COO Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani. On the stand, Holmes testified that her romantic relationship with Balwani had been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/29/technology/elizabeth-holmes-sunny-balwani.html"><ins>abusive</ins></a>. Balwani’s trial is scheduled to begin <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-14/balwani-s-theranos-fraud-trial-delayed-as-holmes-fight-drags-on"><ins>in February</ins></a>.</p><p>There has been no shortage of pop culture depictions of Holmes. After Carreyrou’s best seller, <em>Bad Blood</em>, there was an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-09-the-inventor-hbo-theranos.html"><ins>HBO documentary</ins></a> and several podcasts about Theranos’ rise and ultimate downfall. Hulu is set to debut a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hulu-theranos-series-the-dropout-march-3-222307396.html"><ins>new miniseries</ins></a> about the saga, with Amanda Seyfried starring as Holmes, in March. And Apple recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-theranos-elizabeth-holmes-movie-200124528.html"><ins>nabbed</ins></a> the Jennifer Lawrence-led film adaptation of <em>Bad Blood</em>.</p><p>Holmes, who will likely appeal the charges, could face up to 20 years in prison, though it&#39;s not yet clear when she will be sentenced. Following the verdict, the judge in the case said Holmes would be allowed to remain free on bail for the time being, though a new hearing &quot;to discuss any change in the conditions of Holmes&#39; liberty&quot; could come as soon as next week, according to <em>Mercury News</em> reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/ethanbaron/status/1478172178352771076">Ethan Baron</a>. Prosecutors also asked for Holmes bail conditions to be changed, which would require her &quot;to put up cash or property, rather than just her signature, to cover her $500,000 bail.&quot;</p><p>The judge also declared a mistrial on the three wire fraud charges that had left the jury deadlocked. The mistrial leaves open the possibility of a new trial, though the prosecutors haven&#39;t said whether they would pursue such an action.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-verdict-guilty-fraud-001725594.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">66c4f3e6-b097-45cb-8eaf-d81405c6c03e</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 00:17:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641259554</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T01:25:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Crime & Justice]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/9c9a04b0-09db-11ec-bf5b-3b65dc6250b6" width="2802" height="1930" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/9c9a04b0-09db-11ec-bf5b-3b65dc6250b6" width="2802" height="1930" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Elizabeth Holmes, founder and former CEO of Theranos, arrives for motion hearing on Monday, November 4, 2019, at the U.S. District Court House inside Robert F.

The Cypress Hero Backpack has a built-in location tracker that could help its rightful owner find it through the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-find-my-network-tracking-upgrades-032304589.html">Find My network</a> if it goes missing. Conversely, if you misplace your iPhone, you can press a button on the backpack to ping your phone, as long as you&#39;ve set things up in the Targus app.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/targus/">Targus</a> says the tracker is &quot;highly integrated&quot; into the backpack, which should offer some additional anti-theft protection. You can set up geofencing alerts, so if the backpack moves out of a certain area, you&#39;ll receive an alert. The tracker also has a built-in sound alert (which will likely be around as loud as an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtags-trackers-first-look-hands-on-130036848.html">AirTag</a>) that you can trigger remotely.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The tracker has a replaceable battery that you can top up via USB, though Targus says it will run for around a year before you need to recharge it. Targus crafted the backpack with sustainability in mind, as it&#39;s made with 26 recycled water bottles. The Cypress Hero Backpack, which has an IPX3 water resistance rating, should be available sometime in the spring or summer. It costs $150.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3f595fb0-6810-11ec-afcf-ca235cdcce81" alt="Targus DOCK720 docking station." data-uuid="d3ffb672-3fd8-3073-9817-1868767b1aef"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Targus</div></figure><p>On top of that, Targus announced the DOCK720, a docking station that supports a single 8K monitor or up to four 4K monitors. The company says it&#39;s the &quot;first biometric device and docking solution in one&quot; — in other words, it has a fingerprint reader. You can expect an array of ports too, including USB-A, USB-C, Ethernet, HDMI and a combo audio jack. The dock will be available this month for $443.</p><p>The Targus Docking Display, meanwhile, is a 24-inch 1080p LCD monitor with a built-in 2MP webcam, microphone, speakers and USB-C docking station. You can daisy chain it to a second monitor and power both displays from your computer. The Docking Display will ship in February. The primary monitor costs $400 and the secondary monitor (which doesn&#39;t have a webcam) is $180.</p><p>In addition, Targus is expanding its lineup of antimicrobial products, which now includes backpacks, shoulder bags and protective sleeves for laptops. The company claims its DefenseGuard Antimicrobial Protection effectively prevents the growth of 99.9% of germ-causing microorganisms.</p><p>It will also release the UV-C LED Disinfection Light next month after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/targus-uv-light-antimicrobial-backpack-150036748.html">debuting it at CES 2021</a>. For five minutes every hour, the $300 device will bathe a surface (or, more likely, a keyboard and mouse) in ultraviolet light to effectively kill 99 percent of pathogens.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/targus-smart-backpack-apple-find-my-tracker-docking-station-monitor-disinfection-light-230012642.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5a8b9f0f-4bca-420b-bcc1-3c3d78445d19</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 23:00:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641221478</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T14:51:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/0cd19530-6810-11ec-bd7d-72b1f685ba8e" width="1650" height="1275" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/0cd19530-6810-11ec-bd7d-72b1f685ba8e" width="1650" height="1275" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Targus]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Targus Cypress Hero Backpack with a built-in location tracker.

One of the limitations of those devices is that they typically only include one monitoring function. In the long run, that’s something that can cost you extra money if you move and end up with too many of one sensor and not enough of another. Security camera maker <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Arlo" href="https://fave.co/3EPKaj4">Arlo</a> may have an elegant solution for that problem.</p><p>At CES 2022, the company introduced a security system that includes an all-in-one multi-sensor with eight monitoring functions. It can detect motion (including door and window openings), water leaks, light and temperature changes, as well as sounds made by T3 and T4 smoke alarms. Each sensor is about an inch wide and connects to a modular hub that includes a backlit keypad and NFC connectivity so that you can use your phone to activate and disarm the system. The hub is also compatible with Arlo’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arlo-video-doorbell-pro-3-irl-150052184.html">various security cameras</a> and its <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Secure subscription service" href="https://fave.co/3CQaola">Secure subscription service</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Arlo Security System will go on sale sometime in the first half of 2022, according to a statement the company shared with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22865040/arlo-smart-home-security-system-price-availability-ces2022"><em>The Verge</em></a>. It promised to disclose more information, including details on pricing, closer to release. The company didn’t have anything to say about the Security System’s smart home integrations today, but it did announce that it will support the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chip-rebrand-matter-221410229.html">Matter</a> standard moving forward.

In 2021, Norwegian dealerships sold 176,276 cars, 65 percent of which were EVs. That’s an 11 percentage point increase from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/evs-outsell-traditional-engines-in-norway-for-all-of-2020-115746618.html">year prior</a> when they accounted for 54 percent of all new car sales.&nbsp;</p><p>The Tesla Model 3 was the most popular choice among new buyers followed by Toyota’s hybrid RAV4, the only car with an internal combustion engine to make the country’s top-ten best-selling list.

In 2021, the country’s federal government missed out on approximately $3.41 billion in tax revenue to push forward on its plan to end all gasoline-powered car sales by 2025.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/evs-outsell-gas-cars-norway-2021-185544342.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b4a1c81a-151f-4b64-93d5-7523b1fa1fe6</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 18:55:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641303024</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T13:30:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/80abe180-2843-11eb-af43-631e2ff69ad6" width="1920" height="1097" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/80abe180-2843-11eb-af43-631e2ff69ad6" width="1920" height="1097" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tesla Model 3]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tesla Model 3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mercedes-Benz boasts 620-mile range for its latest EV concept]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="851681933b794e2c93d36a9c065d33ce"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEVZWNbn7ys?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Mercedes-Benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> has <a href="https://media.mbusa.com/releases/release-211879a94f6a1a0ff764674cdc0a8630-vision-eqxx-taking-electric-range-and-efficiency-to-an-entirely-new-level">unveiled</a> a concept electric vehicle it claims would be able to run for more than 620 miles before needing to recharge. Should it come to fruition and live up to that promise, the Vision EQXX would beat the range of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lucids-longest-range-air-ev-has-a-prodigious-520-miles-of-epa-range-123000043.html">Lucid Air Dream Edition</a> by more than 100 miles and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-model-s-400-mile-epa-range-104057637.html">Tesla Model S Long Range Plus</a> by around 220 miles.</p><p>&quot;The Mercedes-Benz Vision EQXX is how we imagine the future of electric cars,&quot; Mercedes-Benz head Ola Källenius said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Based on the automaker&#39;s simulations, the Vision EQXX would use less than 10 kWh to travel 62 miles on public roads, delivering an efficiency of more than 6 miles per kWh. Converted into fossil fuel consumption, Mercedes says that&#39;s around the &quot;golden figure&quot; of 1 liter of gasoline per 62 miles.</p><p>The battery is half the size of and 30 percent lighter than the one in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-eqs-ev-review-video-150001883.html">EQS</a>.

The automaker says that, with a drag coefficient of cd 0.17, the EV is more aerodynamic than a football (which has a cd of 0.18 to 0.2). What&#39;s more, Mercedes claims that 95 percent of battery energy is directed to the wheels.</p><p>Teams from Mercedes&#39; research and development centers worked with its Formula 1 and Formula E engineers on the concept. They harnessed digital tools to reduce waste and weight by cutting out excess material — the wheels are made with magnesium and the brake discs are built with aluminum alloy. The Vision EQXX uses recycled and plant-based materials too.&nbsp;</p><p>As for the interior, the Vision EQXX&#39;s infotainment system has a single 47.5-inch, mini-LED 8K screen. Like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-mbux-hyperscreen-eqs-161520472.html">Hyperscreen</a> in the EQS, it spans almost the entire width of the cabin, though this is a one-piece display. The automaker worked with NAVIS Automotive Systems on a navigation system with zoom and scroll functions that include a satellite view. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-smartthings-mercedes-benz-voice-assistant-s-class-2021-230117108.html">&quot;Hey Mercedes&quot; voice assistant</a> is integrated into the infotainment system too.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/673da070-6cc2-11ec-bfff-c30886bb6d02" alt="Mercedes-Benz Vision EQXX interior and infotainment system." data-uuid="8b94826e-344c-3d32-bea0-768469237380"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mercedes-Benz</div></figure><p>Even if Mercedes doesn&#39;t bring the Vision EQXX to show floors, developing the stylish concept has proven a valuable endeavor.
