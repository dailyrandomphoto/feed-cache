The move makes the city one of the first municipalities in the US to aggressively regulate an industry that has grown by leaps and bounds during the pandemic.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-23/nyc-poised-to-improve-food-delivery-driver-working-conditions">Per <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the legislation touches nearly every aspect of the job. For instance, addressing an issue that was a subject of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/doordash-settle-dc-lawsuit-045945934.html"><ins>$2.5 million settlement</ins></a>, delivery apps and courier services must disclose their gratuity policies, and guarantee that workers always receive their tips. They must also pay them at least once a week, and provide them with payment options that don’t necessitate the need for a bank account. Another part of the legislation mandates platforms include a clause in their contracts with restaurants to ensure they provide bathroom access to delivery workers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Both Grubhub and DoorDash told Engadget they support the legislation, though the latter voiced some reservations about specific measures. “We recognize the unique challenges facing delivery workers in New York City and share the goal of identifying policies that will help Dashers and workers like them,” a DoorDash spokesperson said. “We will continue to work with all stakeholders, including the City Council, to identify ways to support all delivery workers in New York City without unintended consequences.”</p><p>The company specifically pointed to the restroom mandate, which lawmakers tweaked near the end of the process to put the onus of ensuring compliance on platform holders. It’s also concerned about a provision that gives delivery workers the ability to set limits on their routes. The company contends that’s something that could hurt customers in underserved areas.</p><p>Meanwhile, Grubhub voiced, at least publicly, stronger support for the laws. “These bills are common-sense steps to support the delivery workers who work hard every day for New York’s restaurants and residents,” a spokesperson for the company told Engadget. “Ensuring they receive a living wage and have access to restrooms isn’t just a good idea — it’s the right thing to do.”</p><p>Just how difficult it can be to make a living as a delivery worker was put in sharp relief last month when Hurricane Ida blanketed New York City with torrential rain. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/03/nyregion/ida-delivery-workers-safety.html"><ins>Images and videos</ins></a> of workers navigating flooded streets spread on social media, leading to calls for more regulation.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/new-york-city-food-delivery-workers-laws-234217000.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c4438151-4218-41eb-9bed-50ceec2690f2</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 23:42:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632440543</ingested><modified>2021-09-23T23:42:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/be8aa510-25f3-11eb-b6ff-e33a90341a89" width="4977" height="3319" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/be8aa510-25f3-11eb-b6ff-e33a90341a89" width="4977" height="3319" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Carlo Allegri / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A delivery person for Doordash rides his bike in the rain during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., November 13, 2020.

Anya Taylor-Joy, star of Netflix&#39;s hit series <em>Queen&#39;s Gambit</em> will portray Princess Peach while <em>It&#39;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</em> star Charlie Day will voice Luigi. Jack Black will of course be the voice behind series villain, Bowser, while Keegan Michael-Key has been cast as Toad. And, for some reason, Seth Rogan will be in this too as Donkey Kong? The company is also bringing back long-time voice actor Charles Martinet — who has portrayed Mario and the rest of his cohort in a number of games to date — to fill in on various cameos throughout the film.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/chris-pratt-and-charlie-day-headline-the-mario-bros-movie-in-2022-230924814.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8442789e-8e01-44a0-b476-09b850ff7c2e</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 23:09:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632438568</ingested><modified>2021-09-23T23:09:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2018-10/396bc3a0-d71c-11e8-8d9f-202fc0014b01" width="3400" height="2571" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2018-10/396bc3a0-d71c-11e8-8d9f-202fc0014b01" width="3400" height="2571" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[TIMOTHY A.

Per the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58668534"><em><ins>BBC</ins></em></a>, the UK Court of Appeal recently <a href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2021/1374.html"><ins>ruled</ins></a> against Dr. Stephen Thaler in a case involving the country’s Intellectual Property Office. In 2018, Thaler filed two patent applications in which he didn’t list himself as the creator of the inventions mentioned in the documents. Instead, he put down his AI DABUS and said the patent should go to him “by ownership of the creativity machine.”</p><p>The Intellectual Property Office told Thaler he had to list a real person on the application. When he didn’t do that, the agency decided he had withdrawn from the process. Thaler took the case to the UK’s High Court. The body ruled against him, leading to the eventual appeal. &quot;Only a person can have rights. A machine cannot,&quot; Lady Justice Elisabeth Laing of the Appeal Court wrote in her judgment. &quot;A patent is a statutory right and it can only be granted to a person.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Thaler has filed similar legal challenges in other countries, and the results so far have been mixed. In August, a <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/australian-judge-rules-inventions-6431529/"><ins>judge in Australia ruled</ins></a> inventions created by an AI can qualify for a patent. However, only earlier this month, US District Judge Leonie M Brinkema upheld a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-patent-office-artificial-intelligence-inventor-patent-221309654.html"><ins>decision by the US Patent and Trademark Office</ins></a> that said “only natural persons may be named as an inventor in a patent application.&quot; Judge Brinkema said there may eventually be a time when AI becomes sophisticated enough to satisfy the accepted definitions of inventorship, but noted, “that time has not yet arrived, and, if it does, it will be up to Congress to decide how, if at all, it wants to expand the scope of patent law.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/uk-appeal-court-artificial-intelligence-patent-191631993.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1a0f61a8-22ff-4e0f-beb9-2aac42652b8c</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 19:16:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632424661</ingested><modified>2021-09-23T19:17:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/44507a40-1ca1-11ec-af7e-f61faa6bcdca" width="4950" height="3300" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/44507a40-1ca1-11ec-af7e-f61faa6bcdca" width="4950" height="3300" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[oonal via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Patent pending files folder]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Patent pending files folder]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft Edge update adds tab groups and new shopping features]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just ahead of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-release-date-132605467.html"><ins>Windows 11 launch</ins></a>, Microsoft is <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/09/23/our-top-new-features-are-designed-to-put-your-family-first/"><ins>rolling out</ins></a> some updates to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/edge"><ins>Edge</ins></a>.

The browser can give you swift access to reviews and ratings for more than 5 million products. When you&#39;re on a product page, click the blue tag on the address bar and you&#39;ll see expert reviews from reliable sources, as well as the average consumer star rating from various retailers.</p><p>When you do figure out what to buy, Microsoft aims to help you complete the transaction a bit faster. If you select a retailer&#39;s guest checkout option, you can click &quot;Try express checkout&quot; on the address bar. After you fill in your details manually one time, Edge can save them for future transactions on any shopping site. Once you&#39;re sure everything&#39;s accurate, click the &quot;Try all coupons and autofill details.&quot; Edge will then add your information and automatically find out if there are any coupons that can save you some cash, in a similar way to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-21-paypal-buys-money-saving-service-honey.html"><ins>PayPal&#39;s Honey tool</ins></a>.</p><p>Elsewhere, Edge now has built-in travel recommendations. When you look up flights, you can click a notification on the address bar and you&#39;ll see suggestions of things to visit and do at your planned destination. The tool is only available in the US and on select booking sites for now, but it will be available elsewhere soon.</p><p>On top of that, it should be a bit faster for you to look for flights and hotels across multiple websites.

The company says it’s working on making conversations in Spaces easier to discover, and will begin to feature more Spaces at the top of users’ timelines.</p><p>It’s also working on a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-spaces-section-of-app-184333909.html"><ins>dedicated tab</ins></a> for the feature, where users can browse recommendations and upcoming Spaces. And it plans to add recording and playback features so users can listen to conversations after they have already ended. The company is also adding new ways for creators to monetize Spaces. In addition to Ticketed Spaces, which began rolling out <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-ticketed-spaces-launching-224353538.html"><ins>in August</ins></a>, Twitter plans to start a dedicated fund for Spaces hosts.

It&#39;s not clear exactly what this would look like, but she said it could take the form of a badge or another visual cue. “We are interested in making it somehow visually clear that this is a[n] authenticated avatar and, and then giving you some interesting info and insight about the provenance of that NFT.”</p><p>Twitter has previously experimented with NFTs or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nft-explainer-digital-art-collectibles-blockchain-environment-business-investment-cryptocurrency-153023551.html">non-fungible tokens</a>.

In August, the <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/uk/afghanistan.html">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</a> said there were 2.6 million registered Afghan refugees worldwide.

In the six years since, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-auto-google-maps-ui-right-hand-drive-cars-181544539.html">both Android Auto</a> and the infotainment systems they operate on have gotten a whole lot smarter. On Thursday, Google announced that it will be rolling out even more features and capabilities to drivers, whether they run Android Auto on their phones or directly through their cars.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While Android Auto has been designed to minimize distractions to the driver when on the road, initially connecting the phone to the infotainment or stereo system has to date been a whole thing. You’d have to make sure the Bluetooth radio was live on your phone, then cajole the vehicle into recognizing and pairing with the device, then remember the myriad various oral commands to incite Android Auto into doing what you actually wanted it to. But no longer! Drivers will soon be able to effectively automate the tethering process just by saying “Hey Google, let’s drive.”&nbsp;</p><p>What’s more, Google has redesigned the Auto UI to enable access to a bevy of content sources including Amazon Music, Audible, iHeartRadio, JioSaavn, Pandora, Podcast Addict, SoundCloud, and YouTube Music with one-tap accessibility as well as have the system read incoming text messages aloud and allow the driver to respond by voice. Expect to see these new features arrive over the next few weeks in English-speaking markets as well as Germany, Spain, Mexico, France and Italy.</p><p>And for international travelers using dual-SIM phones, Android Auto will allow you to establish separate Work and Personal profiles and have their relevant contact lists and calendar appointments display, depending on when and why they’re behind the wheel.</p><p>For vehicles with in-car displays, Android Auto (the mirroring version, not what you’d find on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/for-polestar-the-twos-are-anything-but-terrible-130059155.html">Polestar 2</a> or the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volvos-c-40-recharge-knocks-the-ass-off-its-xc-40-predecessor-and-we-love-them-for-it-163057786.html">XC40 Recharge</a>) will soon boast a few new features, such as games. Google is partnering with GameSnacks to offer drivers quick and fun diversions to play while the vehicle is parked. Finally, an end to doom-scrolling while sitting in public charging lots. Conversely, Google is making paying for gas less interactive. Just say “Hey Google, pay for gas” to have the vehicle’s infotainment system complete a contactless payment with Google Pay. You do have to select the fuel grade and, you know, actually pump the gas but, still. The feature will be available at Exxon and Mobil gas stations to start with support for Shell, Conoco, Phillips 66 and 76 stations coming soon.</p><p>As for the integrated Android Automotive OS (like what you’d find in select Ford, GM, and Volvo vehicles), get ready to see it in a whole bunch of new makes and models. Google announced on Thursday that its latest partner is Honda, which will begin producing vehicles with built-in AAOS come the 2022 model year, and will soon be available in both the Chevy Silverado and the Renault Mégane E-Tech.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-android-automotive-os-honda-2022-160039999.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e307d566-6fe3-449c-8158-5ed1e36547d7</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 16:00:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632400299</ingested><modified>2021-09-23T12:31:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/27b7e140-1bdc-11ec-9eb7-27cee51e8c76" width="3882" height="2833" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/27b7e140-1bdc-11ec-9eb7-27cee51e8c76" width="3882" height="2833" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Kim Kyung Hoon / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Honda Motor's logo is seen on Civic sedan car at its showroom in Tokyo, Japan October 4, 2017.

Google is rolling out a batch of Android feature upgrades that include perks previously reserved for its in-house devices. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-photos-ai-update-2021-edit-memories-184654311.html">Google Photos&#39; Locked Folder</a> is coming to Android 6 and newer devices, for instance — you can create a passcode-protected space to keep certain photos and videos separate from the rest.</p><p>Similarly, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-update-smart-compose-recorder-share-underwater-camera-180046621.html">Gboard&#39;s Smart Compose</a> is coming to Android 11 and newer hardware. If you&#39;re writing a common phrase or just want to save time, you&#39;ll get suggestions to complete messages. And there&#39;s good news if you&#39;re prone to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-heads-up-rollout-143602291.html">walking into lamp posts</a> — the Heads Up anti-distracted-walking feature is available through Digital Wellbeing on all Android 9 or later devices.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Other additions are new to all Android devices. Google Assistant now has a central Reminders hub. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-android-nearby-share-specs-availability-160054637.html">Nearby Share</a> now includes a much-needed privacy control that can limit visibility to no one, contacts only or everyone. Gboard, meanwhile, can automatically suggest pasting addresses, phone numbers, web links and even screenshots. Over 1,500 new Emoji Kitchen stickers are due in the fall. And if you have an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonys-led-bravia-t-vs-with-cognitive-intelligence-start-at-1299-094036566.html">Android TV</a>, you&#39;ll find remote control features built into Android on your phone.</p><p>This strategy is a familiar one for Google. It tends to bring features to Pixels first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-10-google-assistant-compact-revamp-reaches-phones.html">before a wider release</a>, whether it&#39;s to help sell phones or just to ensure they work well before reaching other devices. Whatever the reasons for the staggered launch here, the greater availability might just be welcome if you&#39;re privacy-minded or in a hurry.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/pixel-google-photos-gboard-other-android-devices-160039468.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b9f2d88e-e753-4db9-b94f-05b0518a7b18</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 16:00:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632404582</ingested><modified>2021-09-23T13:43:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/501ead80-1c72-11ec-bd79-e3298f44ca9f" width="1920" height="900" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/501ead80-1c72-11ec-bd79-e3298f44ca9f" width="1920" height="900" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Android TV remote, Heads up, Assistant Reminders hub and accessibility for Android]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Android TV remote, Heads up, Assistant Reminders hub and accessibility for Android]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Android's accessibility updates include a way to control your phone using your face]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google has introduced quite a lengthy list of Android features, including new <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/accessibility/making-android-more-accessible/">accessibility tools</a> for the mobile OS that rely on eye and facial gestures.

Aptly called <a href="https://www.android.com/google-features-on-android/fall-2021/#cameraswitches">Camera Switch</a>, the tool replaces keyboards, mice and touchscreen displays as a device&#39;s input method. With the feature, users will be able to navigate their phones with eye movements or with facial features, such as smiling or opening and closing their mouths. The tech giant started <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-camera-switches-control-phone-face-114800871.html">beta testing</a> it in August, but it&#39;s now giving the feature a wider rollout.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/61306940-1c65-11ec-bf5f-986f09574abe" style="height:329;width:640;" alt="Android" data-uuid="5393304c-2369-3404-aff8-09ac8647224c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>The tech giant has also launched a new application called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.vision.switches">Project Activate</a> specifically for those don’t speak or have neurological conditions.

They can program the app to speak phrases like &quot;Please, wait!&quot; when they move their eyes a certain way or make a gesture with their face. The application can also be programmed to play audio, make phone calls or send texts, such as emergency messages seeking assistance.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Finally, Google has updated its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-08-google-lookout-app.html">Lookout app</a> with handwriting recognition.

It’s an intriguing array of concepts, but as a long-time Star Wars fan I couldn’t tell you how they fit into the timeline.

For years now, the TV “Berlanti-verse” has been flirting with continuity, not just in how <em>The Flash</em> was a spinoff of <em>Arrow</em> and <em>Legends of Tomorrow</em> was a spinoff of both, but even having the Flash and Supergirl meet up even though they were on different networks and in different universes.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/74bbdbf0-1c76-11ec-bbbe-de5ef0b676d4" alt="Grant Gustin and Melissa Benoit" data-uuid="c9e11686-5ad1-3732-bcfa-1e3074284795"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">DC</div></figure><p>“Crisis” upped the ante by merging these separate worlds in the end, while also confirming almost every other DC-based TV show as part of the bigger multiverse. It was great for fans who obsessively watch every comic book program they can, but less so for people who would rather keep their viewing limited and compartmentalized.</p><p>On the other side, Marvel didn’t have the same deep catalog as DC did, with its live-action MCU franchise only taking off 13 years ago. Marvel Studios was perfectly happy to wipe the slate clean of everything that had come before, from the 1989 <em>Punisher</em> film to 2007’s <em>Ghost Rider</em> with Nicolas Cage. Since then everything live-action has tied into the universe somehow, including Netflix shows like <em>Daredevil</em>, Hulu shows like <em>Runaways</em> and the Freeform show <em>Cloak &amp; Dagger</em>. This was great for someone committed to the franchise, but could be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-star-wars-marvel-universe-canon-continuity-120159180.html">daunting to casual viewers</a>.</p><div id="d9cfb822275e479f85eb6b218d3aef23"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qRpd4lj69ZY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>It also presented some creative constraints. Everything Marvel now had to fit in with the larger MCU somehow, so once a character appeared another movie or show couldn’t present its own take on the same person (alas, poor Inhumans). They couldn’t have world-shaking events outside of, say, the Avengers films — at least, not without making some kind of excuse why Captain America or Thor couldn’t just come charging in. Everything had to be carefully planned out as the universe expanded and connected internally.</p><p>That’s partly why the show <em>What If…?</em> exists. Sure, it’s based on a pre-existing comic series, but what both show and comic do is allow creators free rein with the characters and events of the Marvel Universe, experimenting to see what would happen if you change one or two things. Though this week’s is hardly a “slight” difference.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/01464b40-1c78-11ec-bdfd-80e3ce750f64" alt="Thor and some " data-uuid="f2626e86-4981-3e32-9ed6-f0b563486ebd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Marvel Studios</div></figure><p>The point of divergence here is that Odin doesn’t adopt Loki as his son, leaving Thor to become an arrogant, spoiled child who prefers to party rather than take his duties as the would-be king of Asgard seriously. How is he still worthy of Mjolnir? We have no idea and the episode isn’t interested in telling us. Instead we’re shown how Thor likes to take the Warriors Three on long benders across the galaxy, with his next destination being the “backwater” of Earth. And everyone’s invited — Drax, Rocket, Howard the Duck, the Grandmaster and even Loki and the other ice giants who somehow, are friends with Thor <em>anyway</em> in this reality. When you consider why and how these characters got involved in the “main” timeline in the first place, it really doesn’t add up.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/63b592e0-1c78-11ec-9f0f-73f461f9c3e1" alt="Captain Marvel, Frigga and Thor" data-uuid="3915a3bb-f277-37f9-b8c4-376ae8db8f6b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Marvel Studios</div></figure><p>You could just try to enjoy it at face value, as just a silly story  with no larger bearing on continuity. However, the point has been made repeatedly that this show is technically, in continuity, and not just in the sense that the Marvel Universe consists of many realities and everything is valid somewhere. While other comics and shows can be given an official universe “number” like 616 or 1,999,999 and just written off as a huge divergence from what we know, the concept of <em>What If…?</em> is that it shows us incremental changes from the MCU in particular. But the divergences shown in this week’s episode are far more than incremental, with an offbeat, cartoonish tone to match. It’s the least <em>What If</em>-like <em>What If…?</em> installment so far.</p><p>Unfortunately, like most of the episodes so far, it still ends on a downbeat, one that’s sort of rushed in and not explained. I can’t even imagine how we ended up with a Vision-Ultron hybrid in possession of the Infinity Stones and, unless this episode gets a sequel, it doesn’t really matter. The ending is just a non sequitur to affirm, as every episode does, that the regular MCU sequence of events is the “correct one.” It’s tacked on, and makes what was already a messy adventure even worse.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/cd5ab590-1c78-11ec-affb-452e5e4a6ee0" alt="Padawan and Jedi Master" data-uuid="42003a17-c357-354c-af54-b91314ad61bc"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Lucasfilm</div></figure><p>This is where the strength of <em>Star Wars: Visions</em> lies. There’s no attempt to tie the episodes to each other or the larger Star Wars universe. It lets each installment stand on its own as an homage to the larger “ideas” of Star Wars, while also showcasing the idiosyncrasies of each studio. The third episode, “The Twins,” is a great example of this in action. There’s a lightsaber fight on the hull of a Star Destroyer! No one is wearing environmental suits! They’re yelling at each other despite a lack of air! People’s clothes explode off their bodies! It doesn’t make a damn lick of sense, but it doesn’t have to, because it’s not meant to be more than a bit of fun.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/star-wars-visions-marvel-studios-what-if-season-one-153109359.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9e71fb83-d098-4886-bbda-2698cae54b38</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 15:31:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632426878</ingested><modified>2021-09-23T19:54:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cartoons & Comics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d8142400-1c76-11ec-9fc6-7db93704f496" width="1920" height="816" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d8142400-1c76-11ec-9fc6-7db93704f496" width="1920" height="816" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Lucasfilm]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Girl handles a black-bladed lightsaber]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Star Wars: Visions]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Europe may require all phone manufacturers to use USB-C charging]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Europe may require all manufacturers to use USB-C charging for all phones and electronic devices, according to a new EU Commission <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_4613">ruling proposal</a>. It aims to reduce e-waste and &quot;consumer inconvenience&quot; caused by different and incompatible chargers still in use. The Commission also wants manufacturers to unbundle the sale of chargers with electronic devices.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;With today&#39;s proposal... USB-C will become the standard port for all smartphones, tablets, cameras, headphones, portable speakers and handheld videogame consoles,&quot; according to the report.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The EU said its work with industry has managed to reduce the number of mobile phone chargers from 30 to 3 over the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-12-29-european-standardization-bodies-formalize-micro-usb-cellphone-ch.html">last decade</a>. One of those three is Apple&#39;s Lightning port used by around 20 percent of devices sold in Europe. The EU hopes to change that situation, according to a statement by executive VP Margrethe Vestager:</p><blockquote><p>European consumers were frustrated long enough about incompatible chargers piling up in their drawers. We gave industry plenty of time to come up with their own solutions, now time is ripe for legislative action for a common charger. This is an important win for our consumers and environment and in line with our green and digital ambitions.</p></blockquote><p>When a common charger was first voted on by the EU <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-31-european-union-wants-common-charging-cable-standard.html">last year</a>, Apple issued a statement saying that the proposal would &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-23-apple-rejects-eu-call-for-common-phone-charger.html">stifle innovation</a>,&quot; and its position has not changed. &quot;We remain concerned that strict regulation mandating just one type of connector stifles innovation rather than encouraging it, which in turn will harm consumers in Europe and around the world,&quot; an Apple spokesperson told the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58665809"><em>BBC</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the launch of the iPhone 12, however, Apple has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-2021-environmental-progress-report-iphone-12-power-adapter-144626760.html">stopped including</a> chargers in the box, something it said would save 861,000 tons of copper, zinc and tin. Apple itself now uses USB-C charging on its latest Mac laptops and certain iPad models, since that standard supports higher voltage charging required for larger devices.</p><p>Nearly all Android smartphones now use USB-C charging, and many models from Samsung and others are sold with charging/data cables but not chargers. It total, around 420 million mobile phones and other portable electronic devices sold in Europe just in the last year.</p><p>The EU throws away 12,000 tons of chargers each year, some unused, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-23/iphones-may-need-redesign-as-eu-pushes-for-common-charger"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. At the same time, consumers spend around 2.4 billion euros ($2.8 billion) on standalone chargers not included with devices. The law is still in the proposal stages and needs to be passed by EU lawmakers and governments, so it could come into force around two years after that.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/europe-proposes-usb-c-as-a-common-charger-for-electronic-devices-131605815.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b5a41212-fbbf-4825-9b4f-6ecbe5b48669</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 13:16:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632402968</ingested><modified>2021-09-23T13:16:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f4d810a0-1c68-11ec-97ee-bdaf0c2ff766" width="4000" height="2654" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f4d810a0-1c68-11ec-97ee-bdaf0c2ff766" width="4000" height="2654" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Vadym  Plysiuk via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Man connecting USB Type C Port Cable for charging to the smartphone.

Kirk and his crew occasionally faced off against computers gone amok, including <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Nomad">Nomad</a>, <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Landru_(machine)">Landru</a> and the <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/M-5_multitronic_unit">M-5</a>. The only way to defeat these digital villains was to outwit them using logic, which caused them to self-destruct. But in <em>The Next Generation</em>, the franchise became more interested in exploring the personhood of artificial beings like <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Data">Data</a> and <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Lal">his</a><a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Lore">family</a>, <em>Voyager</em>’s <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/The_Doctor">holographic doctor</a> or the <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Exocomp">exocomps</a>. This week, <em>Lower Decks</em> dredges up the old-style megalomaniacal AI and asks, are you really sure about those rights?</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The <em>USS Cerritos</em> is once more called upon to help out a civilization enslaved by an evil computer, this one called Agimus (voiced by long-time Trek actor Jeffrey Combs). Disconnected from his network of drones, he’s actually pretty pathetic, desperately begging the organic beings around him to just hook him up to a computer. All that’s left for Starfleet to do is to drop him off at the Daystrom Institute, which isn’t the most glamorous of jobs, so of course Beckett Mariner and Bradward Boimler end up on this particular babysitting gig.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6747baa0-1b15-11ec-befe-01ad643a0094" style="height:675;width:1200;" alt="" data-uuid="9dc9a6fe-b0df-3c1b-8f0d-8f7da5c9a029"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>A gravimetric shear complicates things for the pair, forcing their shuttle to crash on a barren world with only the pleading voice of Agimus to keep them company. The computer uses this opportunity to pit the two against each other, continuing a plot thread that we thought had been settled two episodes ago. Beckett still doesn’t trust Brad&#39;s abilities despite <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-episode-four-070120756.html">all they’ve</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-070123812.html">been through</a>. It feels like a regression or perhaps even a mis-scheduled episode, except that we the audience still see his growth while his supposed best friend doubts him. It’s a plot line unlikely to go away after a few episodes, reaffirming this show’s commitment to character-driven storytelling.</p><p>However, that breadth of characterization doesn’t really apply to Agimus. He’s really just… kind of a jerk, and he doesn’t have the ability to directly influence anything due to his lack of arms and legs. Boimler and Mariner spend the entire episode lugging his box around: a sentient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a>. If you’re not familiar with that term, it means an item (or person) that moves the plot forward and motivates the characters, but is not actually important in itself. With Agimus’s reign over, he really just serves here to get Mariner and Boimler at each other’s throats.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/42e1cc00-1b15-11ec-adbf-2104cc27ab8d" style="height:675;width:1200;" alt="" data-uuid="4f10a205-4e76-3010-a036-53e886aadc79"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p></p><p>His status as a sentient being is never in question, but the problem of what to do with him as his behavior worsens goes in directions that would never come up for an organic individual. Mariner suggests burying him, a suggestion turned down by Boimler because he’s a sentient being and that’s not what Starfleet does. So it seems we have made some progress from the ol’ “destroy them with their own logic” days of <em>TOS</em>. But then the two ensigns end up burying him anyway, while Agamus protests that “he has rights!”</p><p>And yet Star Trek has always been a bit sketchy about what those rights are. While episodes like “<a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/The_Measure_Of_A_Man_(episode)">The Measure of a Man</a>” and “<a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/The_Offspring_(episode)">The Offspring</a>” have reaffirmed Data’s humanity, it’s been contradicted since by events on <em>Voyager</em> and <em>Picard</em>. The Doctor asserted <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Author,_Author_(episode)">his authorial rights to a holonovel he created and won</a>, but wasn’t actually recognized as a person. The question <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-25-star-trek-picard-technology-evolution.html">remained unanswered</a> nearly 20 years later on <em>Picard</em>, with us only being shown holograms of limited capabilities, or those based on the personalities of other sentient beings (Rios’ crew). And fully synthetic beings like Data, ones with brains <em>and</em> bodies, were illegal after the attack on Mars.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/84867430-1b15-11ec-b7be-eb71c85bddb1" style="height:675;width:1200;" alt="" data-uuid="24be9bec-ac44-3c75-937e-7c468548ceb2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p><em>Lower Decks</em> takes place a mere year after the end of <em>Voyager</em>, so it’s free to pick up and explore some of those plot threads without that later baggage. But without a synthetic crew member on the <em>USS Cerritos</em> it can only glance off the subject. Agamus is dumped in a storage facility as just another “self-aware megalomaniacal computer,” not too dissimilar from <a href="https://youtu.be/TASlXWbMZyU">the warehouse</a> where the Ark of the Covenant is dumped at the end of <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em>. Is it a prison? Did he get a trial? Are he and the other computers just going to sit there until the end of the Federation? From an ethical perspective it isn’t great, but it’s unlikely to ever be fully addressed, because who in Starfleet is really going to fight for the personhood of a computerized fascist dictator?</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-episode-seven-130034380.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4c92b204-e76a-486d-80f2-c744968da0b5</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 13:00:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632254575</ingested><modified>2021-09-21T20:03:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e8b53b90-1b14-11ec-adde-8ac8b3144b18" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e8b53b90-1b14-11ec-adde-8ac8b3144b18" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[CBS]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA["Where Pleasant Fountains Lie"  Epi#207 -- Jerry O\'Connell as Commander and Jeffrey Combs as Agimus (computer) of the Paramount+ series STAR TREK: LOWER DECKS.
