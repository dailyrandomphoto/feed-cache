Back then, the commission decided after a lengthy investigation that the tech giant favored its own comparison shopping services and unfairly directed users to its own products over those of its rivals&#39;. That $2.8 billion fine is just a tiny fraction of Alphabet&#39;s (Google&#39;s parent company) <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-08/alphabet-hits-2-trillion-market-value-after-71-rally-this-year?sref=10lNAhZ9">$2 trillion valuation</a>, but it was the biggest financial penalty the commission has ever handed out.</p><p>&nbsp;The court said in a statement:</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>&quot;The General Court finds that, by favoring its own comparison shopping service on its general results pages through more favorable display and positioning, while relegating the results from competing comparison services in those pages by means of ranking algorithms, Google departed from competition on the merits.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>While the General Court mostly <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/google-loses-battle-with-eu-as-court-upholds-2017-order.html">sided</a> with the commission&#39;s findings that Google&#39;s actions had harmful effects on comparison shopping, it disagreed with one element of the EU&#39;s case. As <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-loses-eu-shopping-ads-case-appeal-11636539480"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> noted, it said that regulators weren&#39;t able to prove that the company&#39;s conduct harmed competition among general search engines.</p><p>Back when it appealed the EU&#39;s decision, Google argued that the commission ignored the competition it faces in the e-commerce sector from Amazon. The company could appeal the General Court&#39;s decision yet again by taking the case to the EU&#39;s highest court, the European Court of Justice. A spokesperson told <em>The Journal</em>, however, that the company will still have to review the judgment more closely before deciding whether to file another appeal.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-loses-appeal-eu-antitrust-comparison-shopping-125544574.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e1fcef97-c741-4ff7-96d1-548568599aa2</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 12:55:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636548973</ingested><modified>2021-11-10T12:56:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5fb002c0-4220-11ec-b8fc-34d845d91de2" width="5417" height="2928" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5fb002c0-4220-11ec-b8fc-34d845d91de2" width="5417" height="2928" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[PierreOlivierClementMantion via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Dublin, Ireland - February 12, 2019: Architectural detail of the Irish headquarters building of the multinational Google on a winter day]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Architectural detail of the Irish headquarters building of the multinational Google]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Peloton reveals its smart camera for strength training]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You can’t keep a fitness company down.

You can tell your robot vacuum to start and stop cleaning, or to set up a schedule, but the entire interaction is, well, <em>robotic</em>. That changes today with iRobot&#39;s latest Alexa Skill, which taps into the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/irobot-roomba-genius-home-intelligence-bravaa-040110893.html">company&#39;s Genius software platform</a> to deliver smarter and more conversational voice commands.</p><p>You&#39;ll be able to tell Wi-Fi connected Roombas to clean around specific objects, and you can schedule cleaning jobs without sounding like you&#39;re inputting a computer program. As iRobot CEO Colin Angle tells us, the Alexa Skill is one of the most complex ever created. You can even tie a bunch of commands together, even across iRobots vacuums and Bravaa mop. For example, you can shout &quot;Alexa, tell Roomba to clean my dining room every Sunday at 4PM <em>and</em> then run Bravaa.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Additionally, iRobot&#39;s devices will also be able to use Alexa speakers to send announcements about cleaning jobs. Sure, the company&#39;s app already sends you phone notifications, but it&#39;s easy to miss those if you&#39;re cleaning up the house while Roomba works. iRobot devices can also tap into Alexa&#39;s AI-driven Hunches to start cleaning jobs if it thinks you aren&#39;t home. (Hopefully, there&#39;ll be plenty of control about how exactly that feature works.)</p><p>According to Angle, iRobot has a fundamental belief that you&#39;re supposed to be able to talk to your robots, and &quot;do so in a natural and sophisticated fashion.&quot; When Amazon was first developing Alexa, he says, one of the earliest concepts discussed was being able to use voice commands to control Roombas. Given iRobot&#39;s push towards making its device smarter — the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/irobot-roomba-j-7-object-poop-detection-040152887.html">latest Roomba </a>has enough cameras and processing smarts to detect objects, even dog poop — it was only a matter of time until it focused more on voice support.</p><p>While iRobot&#39;s software platform taps into the maps Roombas create around your floorplans, Angle says the company isn&#39;t sharing any data with Amazon. Similarly, he claims iRobot isn&#39;t learning anything from Amazon either. Still, the two companies had to work together to ensure that a complex string of voice commands could work properly with Alexa. And looking ahead, iRobot plans to add even more features, like the ability to set a Do Not Disturb time for cleaning jobs.</p><p>It&#39;ll be interesting to see how much Roomba customers will actually want to talk with their robots. I&#39;ve used the company&#39;s original Alexa skill since it launched, but I still end up starting cleaning jobs from my phone most of the time. I&#39;m also hoping we&#39;ll eventually see these voice smarts on platforms other than Amazon&#39;s. Angle says the company is working with Google about optimizing its Home skill, but Apple hasn&#39;t been as receptive (at least you can get some <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/18/irobot-roomba-siri-control/">Siri support with IFTTT</a>).</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/irobot-roomba-smarter-alexa-skill-voice-commands-120027590.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c75892be-df92-4503-bcf6-babcbd047dc6</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 12:00:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636518171</ingested><modified>2021-11-10T04:23:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9161d080-41dc-11ec-b7f5-e86006f2e3d9" width="2048" height="1536" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9161d080-41dc-11ec-b7f5-e86006f2e3d9" width="2048" height="1536" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[iRobot]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Roomba j7+ with Alexa]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Roomba j7+ with Alexa]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[iOS 15.2 beta introduces nearby AirTag searches and Legacy Contacts]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple is introducing another way to ensure its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtags-trackers-first-look-hands-on-130036848.html">AirTags</a> won&#39;t be used for stalking when iOS 15.2 comes out. According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/09/ios-15-2-airtag-scan/"><em>MacRumors</em></a>, the beta version of the mobile platform that has just come out has a new feature that will let users scan for AirTags that may be tracking their location.

For users that hide AirTags in bikes, other items thieves could steal and even their pets&#39; collars, this could prevent them from catching the culprit and retrieving their property.

The UK’s Supreme Court has ruled that it cannot allow a US-style Class Action suit to be lobbed at the search giant after it deliberately created a workaround to track Safari users. The <a href="https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2019-0213-judgment.pdf">judgment</a>, read by Lord Leggatt, was focused on procedural matters, like the intersection between Google, based in the US, and the UK’s data protection laws. More importantly, however, was the issue of “damage,” and the fact that the claimants — led by consumer rights champion Richard Lloyd — had not established that any material harm had been caused by Google’s workaround.</p><p>The story begins in 2017 with Lloyd, and many others, formed a group called “Google You Owe Us” to attempt to sue the company. It alleged that Google had illegally collected data on iPhone users between June 2011 and February 2012 in violation of UK law. The matter hinged on the fact that Google had deliberately created a workaround to get access to data it was not otherwise entitled to. Lloyd and crew <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-08-google-safari-workaround-uk-lawsuit-dismissed.html">lost at the High Court</a>, but this initial decision was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-02-google-safari-privacy-lawsuit-to-continue.html">overturned by the UK’s Court of Appeal</a>, saying that it was quite proper for Google to face a courtroom after the intentional misuse of personal data without consent.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>US-style Class Action lawsuits are not common, or even <em>really a thing</em> in UK law, although it is possible for a large group of litigants to bring a joint action. Lloyd and his cohort were trying to establish that Google’s tracking was, in and of itself, harmful, and by extension a standard level of compensation could be calculated. This was the fact that the Supreme Court rejected most clearly — saying that a set figure (reportedly pegged around £750 (around $1,000) per affected user) was not fair redress.</p><p>David Barker of <a href="https://www.pinsentmasons.com/out-law/analysis/lloyd-v-google-supreme-court-representative-action">Pinsent Masons</a> — the firm Google hired to fight this case — wrote that the decision upholds the notion that compensation can only be asked for where real harm has been caused. And that, put simply, Google’s aggregation of personal data was insufficient to cause any real-world harm or mental distress. Richard Lloyd, who brought the action, told <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/mass-legal-action-against-google-blocked-by-supreme-court-12465082"><em>Sky News</em></a> that he was “bitterly disappointed” that the court had “failed to do enough to protect the public from Google and other Big Tech firms who break the law.” And that this ruling, in effect, is the writing of a blank check for large technology companies to keep misusing user data without fear of censure. He added that it is time for government leaders to step in and craft laws to better clamp down on the misuse of personal data.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/uk-supreme-court-blocks-google-safari-privacy-lawsuit-104432598.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">76c693ae-0b96-4ba5-9d1c-083eb1d45d8d</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 10:44:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636541075</ingested><modified>2021-11-10T10:44:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/80ca2a20-4212-11ec-bdfe-7ed9bb8171fc" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/80ca2a20-4212-11ec-bdfe-7ed9bb8171fc" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM - 2019/08/23: The exterior view of the entrance to the global internet search company Google office in London.

The agency is now aiming to land the first woman and next American man on the lunar surface in 2025 at the earliest, NASA administrator Bill Nelson has announced. NASA was originally targeting a 2028 launch date for its return to the Moon, but the Trump administration moved that date up by four years back in 2017. In a conference call with reporters, Nelson said &quot;the Trump administration&#39;s target of 2024 human landing was not grounded in technical feasibility.&quot;</p><p>In addition to the unrealistic deadline, Nelson blamed Blue Origin&#39;s lawsuit against the agency for the delay.  It had to put its contract with SpaceX <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-spacex-lunar-lander-on-hold-blue-origin-lawsuit-120527376.html">on hold</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lunar-lander-gao-223702744.html">pause work</a> on the lunar lander that&#39;s meant to take astronauts to the surface of the Moon for a couple of times. NASA lost almost seven months of work on the lander as a result, which had cast doubts on the 2024 landing even before Nelson made his announcement.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you&#39;ll recall, NASA <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-nasa-artemis-lunar-lander-contract-report-184448656.html">awarded</a> SpaceX a $2.9 billion contract to develop a Starship-based lunar landing system back in April. The agency historically works with more than one contractor for each mission, but in this instance, it inked a deal with Elon Musk&#39;s company alone. Jeff Bezos&#39;s Blue Origin sued NASA over that decision, arguing that it wasn&#39;t given the chance to revise its bid for the project.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on legal documents <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22689729/blue-origin-moon-lunar-lander-price-nasa-hls-foia"><em>The Verge</em></a> obtained in September, however, NASA felt that Blue Origin &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-on-blue-origin-lawsuit-151130133.html">gambled</a>&quot; with its proposed $5.9 billion lunar lander bid. The company allegedly set the price higher than necessary, because it assumed that NASA would award it a contract but negotiate for a lower price. The Federal Court of Claims ultimately <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-loses-nasa-lawsuit-over-spacex-151101253.html">ruled against Blue Origin</a> a few days ago, dismissing its claims that NASA ignored &quot;key flight safety requirements&quot; when it awarded SpaceX the lunar lander contract.</p><p>Nelson&#39;s announcement comes shortly after NASA <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-artemis-i-sls-launch-date-163749274.html">moved</a> the uncrewed Artemis I flight test launch from this year to February 2022. That&#39;s assuming everything will go as planned — the Orion capsule and Space Launch System that will be used for the mission will still have to go through a battery of tests before NASA can schedule it for blastoff.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nasa-pushes-back-crewed-moon-landing-to-2025-083617472.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b292e4bc-2717-4aa6-866c-dd77bd1a01bf</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 08:36:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636533405</ingested><modified>2021-11-10T08:36:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1656d640-41f7-11ec-bedf-282cf1a3e77c" width="1600" height="1004" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1656d640-41f7-11ec-bedf-282cf1a3e77c" width="1600" height="1004" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SpaceX]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NASA moon landing]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NASA moon landing]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Court rules that Apple can't push back ordered App Store payment changes]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-10/apple-can-t-delay-costly-court-ordered-app-store-change?sref=10lNAhZ9">failed</a> to convince US District c to delay the App Store change she ordered back in September. As the judge for the Apple vs. Epic trial, Rogers ruled in favor of the tech giant for 9 out of 10 counts, but she also decided that Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-epic-games-lawsuit-ruling-app-store-153113436.html">must allow</a> developers to direct users to other payment systems within their apps by December 9th. As a response to that, Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-files-appeal-app-store-injunction-101556698.html">asked for a stay</a> on the injunction to push back its implementation by one more year. Now, Rogers has rejected the company&#39;s appeal for a stay and called the motion &quot;fundamentally flawed.&quot;</p><p>She wrote in the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.830.0_8.pdf">order</a> (PDF, via <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/09/apple-cant-delay-app-store-payment-changes-judge-says-in-epic-case.html"><em>CNBC</em></a>):</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>&quot;...Apple&#39;s motion is based on a selective reading of this Court&#39;s findings and ignores all of the findings which supported the injunction, namely incipient antitrust conduct including supercompetitive commission rates resulting in extraordinarily high operating margins and which have not been correlated to the value of its intellectual property.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Apple argued that it needed more time to establish new guidelines to protect users, developers and itself if it allows alternative payment methods. It also previously said that following the court order and allowing developers to link out to other payment methods by December 9th &quot;would be a poor use of resources&quot; due to the &quot;near-inevitable litigation&quot; from Epic regarding the scope of its compliance. In addition, it&#39;s still appealing this aspect of the case, and the Court of Appeals could take more than a year to come to a decision.</p><p>In her ruling, Rogers said that the party that would benefit most from a stay would be Apple, and that the court can &quot;envision numerous avenues&quot; for the tech giant to comply while still protecting its users. &quot;Other than, perhaps, needing time to establish Guidelines, Apple has provided no credible reason for the Court to believe that the injunction would cause the professed devastation,&quot; she added. Despite the court&#39;s decision, Apple hasn&#39;t given up: It will ask San Francisco&#39;s federal appeals court to put Rogers&#39;s order on hold.</p><p>As <em>CNBC</em> has noted, allowing developers to link out to external payment methods doesn&#39;t mean Apple won&#39;t be taking a percentage of their earnings. Google, for instance, recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-play-store-alternate-payment-south-korea-134255092.html">announced</a> that it will now allow the use of alternative payment systems for Play Store apps in South Korea to comply with local laws. While it lowered its commission by four percent for developers using their own payment processors, they will still have to pay the company a cut nonetheless.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-alternative-payment-stay-injunction-062133997.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2fc428fb-a9ad-445b-84be-87d330792c15</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 06:21:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636543869</ingested><modified>2021-11-10T11:31:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-10/65e95190-e9db-11e9-a7fb-fd7ac0382413" width="4952" height="3185" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/65e95190-e9db-11e9-a7fb-fd7ac0382413" width="4952" height="3185" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nikada via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA["Hong Kong, China - October 20, 2011: People in the Apple Store at International Finance Center, Central Hong Kong, opened on the September 24, 2011.

This may help by reducing the number of exploitative ads, but it could also hurt the relevancy of those ads you do see.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/meta-facebook-removes-sensitive-topic-ad-targeting-222436773.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">21d40c3e-3961-4201-93a7-c66a534575f0</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 22:24:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636496678</ingested><modified>2021-11-09T22:24:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/bb495f80-41a5-11ec-bcff-9aa759160cfe" width="4691" height="3127" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/bb495f80-41a5-11ec-bcff-9aa759160cfe" width="4691" height="3127" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Carlos Barria / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[People pose in front of a sign of Meta, the new name for the company formerly known as Facebook, at its headquarters in Menlo Park, California, U.S. October 28, 2021.

The company says it wants to work with the Oversight Board to “improve the recommendation process,” though it’s not yet clear what those changes might entail. But it suggests Facebook is looking to shake up the way it deals with the independent body it created to oversee its content policies.</p><p>In a <a href="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Meta-Q2-and-Q3-2021-Quarterly-Update-on-the-Oversight-Board.pdf"><ins>new report </ins></a>detailing Facebook’s dealings with the Oversight Board, the company notes that it’s made significant changes as the result of the Oversight Board’s recommendations. These changes include updates to how it handles <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-hate-speech-194501894.html"><ins>hate speech</ins></a> and nudity, as well as how it determines “newsworthy” content.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But Facebook is now suggesting it wants to change up the recommendation process. “While we have made these important changes as a result of the board’s recommendations, we believe the current design of the recommendation process may not be the best way to bring about the long-term, structural changes the board is pushing us to undertake,” the company writes in its report. “We are working with the board and our internal teams to explore other ways to potentially improve the recommendation process.”</p><p>Again, it’s not clear exactly what this means for the Oversight Board or Facebook’s relationship with the group. The Oversight Board didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, and during a call with reporters on Tuesday, Facebook’s Monika Bickert declined to elaborate on specific changes the company was hoping to make.</p><p>In its report, Facebook writes that “the pace and volume of the recommendations do not allow us adequate time to initially assess and implement the recommendations.” According to Facebook, most of the board’s recommendations “require over a dozen people to assess feasibility, which we cannot easily complete in 30 days.” the company added that it can take considerable time to determine how to integrate the policy suggestions into its existing product development.</p><p>But while it’s not yet clear what will change as a result of Facebook’s proposed “potential changes,” the fact that the company is already trying to make major changes to how it deals with the board is significant. Since its inception, Facebook critics have blasted the Oversight Board as little more than a PR stunt. And while the company has said it will abide by individual content decisions made by the board, its broader policy recommendations are where it could have the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-responds-oversight-board-recommendations-210841361.html"><ins>greatest influence</ins></a> over the company. For example, the board criticized Facebook’s decision to impose an “indefinite suspension” on former President Donald Trump, and told the company it needed to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-trump-influence-203741183.html"><ins>better define</ins></a> its rules for politicians.</p><p>Facebook has even suggested that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-other-companies-202448589.html"><ins>other platforms</ins></a> should use the Oversight Board to monitor their content policies as well. That the company is now claiming it’s too difficult to keep up with the process its executives and policy officials designed could potentially undermine the influence the board is able to wield.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-wants-to-change-the-oversight-boards-recommendation-process-212528909.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7f5c3ab0-9ea9-4d65-bcf8-6ddadb7e451f</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 21:25:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636493129</ingested><modified>2021-11-09T21:25:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ff04e120-41a2-11ec-8ed1-4b04c9c94203" width="6074" height="4216" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ff04e120-41a2-11ec-8ed1-4b04c9c94203" width="6074" height="4216" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ANKARA, TURKEY - MAY 07: Oversight Board logo is seen on a smart phone in Ankara, Turkey on May 07, 2020.

The new numbers, released with the company’s latest quarterly transparency reports, come as Meta faces increasing scrutiny over its ability to protect users and enforce its policies adequately around the world.</p><p>Its latest report marks the first time the company has shared &quot;prevalence&quot; metrics around <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/11/how-meta-addresses-bullying-harassment/">bullying and harassment</a> on its platform. &quot;Prevalence&quot; is a statistic Facebook uses to track violating content that slips through its detection systems. &quot;It represents the amount of violating content that people actually view that actually shows up on someone&#39;s screen,&quot; the company&#39;s VP of Integrity Guy Rosen told reporters during a briefing.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to the company, the prevalence of bullying content was between 0.14% -0.15% on Facebook and between 0.05%-0.06% on Instagram. “This means bullying and harassment content was seen between 14 and 15 times per every 10,000 views of content on Facebook and between 5 and 6 times per 10,000 views of content on Instagram,” the company explains in a statement. Instagram in particular has faced questions about its ability to deal with bullying and harassment. The company introduced several new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-new-antibullying-features-and-photo-map-040107581.html">anti-bullying</a> measures earlier this year after several UK football players detailed their experience with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-cracks-down-harassment-direct-messages-185441529.html">racist abuse</a> on the app.&nbsp;</p><p>Importantly, the company notes that this “prevalence” metric only accounts for content Facebook and Instagram removes without a user report. That means the statistic is only capturing a subset of all bullying content, since bullying and harassment is not always easy for an automated system to identify.</p><p>That distinction has been underscored by revelations in the Facebook Papers, a trove of documents made public by former employee turned whistleblower Frances Haugen. According to documents she shared, Facebook’s own researchers <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/25/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-whistleblower/">estimate</a> that the company is only able to address around three to five percent of hate speech on its platform, meaning the vast majority goes undetected and is allowed to pollute users’ News Feeds.</p><p>Facebook has repeatedly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-hate-speech-prevalence-170144850.html">pushed back</a> on these claims, and has pointed to the “prevalence” stats it shares in its transparency reports. But as researchers have <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebooks-deceptive-math-when-it-comes-to-hate-speech/">pointed out</a>, the company’s own accounting of “prevalence” can mask the true amount of violating content on the platform. That’s because Facebook’s automated systems are not always reliable, especially at detecting content in languages <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-ai-enforce-rules-engineers-doubtful-artificial-intelligence-11634338184">other than English</a>. The revelations have fueled allegations that Facebook puts profits ahead of user safety.</p><p>“We have absolutely no incentive, whether it&#39;s commercial or otherwise, to do anything other than make sure people have a positive experience,” Rosen said Tuesday. “I think it&#39;s also just not true that our algorithms are just optimized to squeeze out engagement. We&#39;re constantly refining how we do ranking in order to tackle these problems.”</p><p>In its latest report, Facebook reported that hate speech had declined for the fourth straight quarter, with prevalence declining from 0.05% last quarter to 0.03% this quarter. The company also reported prevalence of hate speech on Instagram for the first time, saying hate speech was at 0.02% or around 2 out of every 10,000 pieces of content viewed on its platform.</p><p>However, it’s worth noting that even the most optimistic take on these numbers — 0.03% and 0.02% for Facebook and Instagram, respectively — can still mean millions of people are encountering hate speech every day, given the vast number of users and pieces of content posted to the platforms each day.&nbsp;</p><p>Separately, Facebook also said<a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/the-shift-to-generalized-ai-to-better-identify-violating-content"> its researchers</a> are working on &quot;a relatively new area of AI research called &#39;few-shot&#39; or &#39;zero-shot&#39; learning,&quot; which would enable them to train AI models much more rapidly. Instead of relying on massive datasets to manually train models for, say identifying hate speech, it would enable models that can &quot;learn to recognize something from just a small number of training examples, or even just a single example,&quot; the company wrote. Facebook didn&#39;t say how long it might take to put this research into action, but it suggests the company is still pursuing AI advancements to address major content issues.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/metas-latest-transparency-report-details-bullying-and-harassment-on-facebook-and-instagram-182854231.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2cc2ce7d-f079-4133-b8a4-b711a52cc572</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 18:28:54 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636486339</ingested><modified>2021-11-09T19:32:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/031e5fd0-4189-11ec-bbbd-6725d3f4bdef" width="5900" height="3758" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/031e5fd0-4189-11ec-bbbd-6725d3f4bdef" width="5900" height="3758" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ANKARA, TURKEY - OCTOBER 29: In this photo illustration logo of Meta is displayed on a mobile phone screen and apps icons on a computer screen in Ankara, Turkey on October 29, 2021.

The company is rolling out a string of sleep-related improvements to Nest screens that include a catalog of Calm &quot;Sleep Stories.&quot; As of December, you can ask Google to &quot;start a meditation&quot; and your smart display will play audio to wind you down. You&#39;ll only have access to several tracks for free, but you can unlock the full library if you have a Calm Premium membership.</p><p>Other upgrades provide more detail for the tracking itself. The second-gen Nest Hub now provides details about sleeping stages, so you&#39;ll know how much time you spend in deep, light or REM sleep. You&#39;ll know how long any interruptions might have lasted, too. The Hub&#39;s sound detection also now focuses only on coughs and snores inside your designated sleeping area, so you&#39;ll know how much a partner (or noisy pet) is affecting your rest. All sounds beyond that area are lumped into an &quot;other sounds&quot; section.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The tracking features start reaching users today. They should be available to all users worldwide in the &quot;next few weeks.&quot;</p><p>Get ready to start paying for all these sleep aids, though. As previously hinted, Google plans to fold these Sleep Sensing features into Fitbit Premium starting in 2023. It&#39;s not certain just what you&#39;ll pay on launch (Fitbit Premium is currently $80 per year), but Google clearly intends to make a profit from its Nest Hubs beyond the initial hardware sale.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nest-hub-sleep-tracking-meditation-180443638.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3edb99ef-cf29-462d-b9ad-e3c851aa3664</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 18:04:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636481085</ingested><modified>2021-11-09T18:05:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/804c7110-4182-11ec-bfee-0b337a886040" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/804c7110-4182-11ec-bfee-0b337a886040" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Nest Hub with Calm sleep meditation]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Nest Hub with Calm sleep meditation]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Virgin Galactic has sold 100 tickets to space since increasing flight prices to $450,000]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/virgin%20galactic/"><ins>Virgin Galactic</ins></a> reopened ticket sales for its trips to the edge of space <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-reopens-ticket-sales-073418808.html">at a higher price</a> back in August, and the company says it has sold 100 of the $450,000 tickets so far.

They can do everything a comparable Chromebook can, while also running traditional Windows software. But now, Microsoft is finally ready to jump into the affordable, kid-friendly PC fray with the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$249 Surface Laptop SE" href="https://fave.co/3nYm3Ke">$249 Surface Laptop SE</a>. It&#39;s one of the first PCs to run Windows 11 SE, a stripped down OS that&#39;s targeted at K-8 students (and their beleaguered teachers). You can also expect to see Windows 11 SE devices are coming from Dell, HP, Acer and ASUS, among other PC makers.</p><p>Microsoft hasn&#39;t had the best luck with Windows variants over the years: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-07-microsoft-windows-10-s-mode.html">Windows 10 S</a> was a limp attempt at delivering a simpler experience for the original Surface Laptop, while the dual-screen focused <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-02-microsoft-windows-10x-dual-screen-pcs-surface-ne0.html">Windows 10X</a> was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-windows-10x-dead-182353110.html">eventually cancelled</a>. (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-review-microsoft-mindful-os-200028040.html">Windows 11</a> basically rose from the ashes of Windows 10 X.) But according to Aaron Woodman, Microsoft&#39;s General Manager of Windows, this latest OS is more focused on solving a specific problem: How can Microsoft create the ideal OS experience for students and teachers?</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3142b9e0-416d-11ec-9edf-2b2784f2d85a" alt="Microsoft Surface Laptop SE" data-uuid="ca75b81e-f201-3708-8f35-9c8b69e43bc8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>Windows 11 SE attempts to do that by focusing on simplicity. There&#39;s no Microsoft Store for installing apps (though IT departments can deploy whatever Win32 and Universal apps they&#39;d like). It&#39;s optimized to run on slower hardware. And Microsoft even stripped down the window snapping options by only allowing apps to be on the left or right side of the screen. One of the best parts of Windows 11 is the easy way you can easily shove an app to different corners of your screen, but that&#39;s probably too complicated for elementary school-aged kids running notebooks with small screens.</p><p>The Surface Laptop SE is similarly basic by design. It&#39;s a plastic-shelled notebook that vaguely resembles the Surface Laptop line, especially the previous cheap entry, the $549 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-go-review-130030486.html">Surface Laptop Go</a>. It has an 11.6-inch TFT LCD screen with a 1,366 by 768 resolution — a step above 720p, but below the Laptop Go&#39;s sub-1080p display. And don&#39;t expect any powerful gear under the hood, as the Surface Laptop SE is limited to dual-core Celeron chips (either the N4020 or N4120), and either 4GB or 8GB of RAM. For storage, there&#39;s a choice between 64GB or 128GB eMMC cards.</p><p>But really, what else do you expect for a starting price of $249? What&#39;s more intriguing about the Surface Laptop SE are the more premium elements that still managed to find their way in. Microsoft brought over the Surface Laptop Go&#39;s excellent keyboard and trackpad, as well as its easy-opening lid, Woodman tells us. The Laptop SE also sports a 720p webcam, which is sharper than what we see on most similarly-priced notebooks. And, judging from a brief Teams video chat I had with Dave Alles, General Manager of Surface Laptop SE, its camera and microphone quality are shockingly solid too. (It was easily better than $1,200 laptops I&#39;ve reviewed.)</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/31421da0-416d-11ec-bbfe-0b729851c285" alt="Microsoft Surface Laptop SE" data-uuid="b7facd1a-abb0-3ff4-b664-33a439e97928"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>For the most part, the Surface Laptop SE appears to be more than enough for a typical grade-school kid. It weighs 2.45 pounds, so it shouldn&#39;t be too tough to lug around in tiny backpacks. And its onboard storage, however meager, should be enough to work on Microsoft Office projects offline. Microsoft claims it&#39;ll get 16 hours of battery life with &quot;typical device usage.&quot; Woodman tells us that the designers had students without reliable internet access in mind. They could download assignments at school, work on them at home, and have their work automatically synchronized when they&#39;re back in class.</p><p>IT departments would likely appreciate the easily accessible screws on the bottom, making it simple to open up and repair notebooks on-site. The Laptop SE&#39;s low price should also make it easier for schools to acquire enough units for every student, instead of sharing a handful of PCs in class.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/31372120-416d-11ec-b6fe-3fb256c07afb" alt="Microsoft Surface Laptop SE" data-uuid="e34a779f-ad3f-3bab-806d-64c23b314beb"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>I&#39;m curious to see how well Windows 11 SE performs on the Laptop SE&#39;s slow hardware. And a part of me wonders if giving kids a more limited version of Windows will hurt their ability to tinker with PCs when they&#39;re older. But as a former IT support jockey, the Surface Laptop SE appears to be the cheap notebook I&#39;ve always wanted grade-school students to have. Sure, it&#39;s not as flexible as the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$400" href="https://fave.co/2YrJdOv">$400</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-go-3-review-130025822.html">Surface Go 3</a>, but for basic coursework that won&#39;t matter too much. And while I liked the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-go-review-130030486.html">Surface Laptop Go</a>, it starts at <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$549" href="https://fave.co/3H702zW">$549</a>—so schools could buy two Laptop SEs for around the same price.&nbsp;</p><p>At this point, Microsoft is only planning to sell the Laptop SE to schools through education resellers later this year. Normal consumers and businesses won&#39;t be able to order them at all. But if it&#39;s wildly successful, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Microsoft finds some way to bring this cheap computer to the masses.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-se-windows-11-se-170034899.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2e2d960a-9da4-4430-bece-02ad4bfcd835</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 17:00:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636484490</ingested><modified>2021-11-09T19:01:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/313af1b0-416d-11ec-bfb9-23cf55b7650c" width="2000" height="1136" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/313af1b0-416d-11ec-bfb9-23cf55b7650c" width="2000" height="1136" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Microsoft Surface Laptop SE]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Microsoft Surface Laptop SE]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Qualcomm is trying to simplify app creation for AR glasses]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Qualcomm is betting it can become a cornerstone in the augmented reality world.

The toolset includes tech to help understand environments and users (including gesture and hand tracking from the newly acquired HINS), software kits for 3D engines like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/unreal-engine-5-early-access-152553496.html">Unreal</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-30-openxr-1-launch.html">OpenXR</a> support and hooks for  platforms like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pokemon-go-niantic-augmented-reality-metaverse-apps-193559416.html">Niantic&#39;s Lightship</a> and Unity&#39;s AR Foundation.</p><p>The ultimate aim is to make AR more accessible.

Twitter Blue, which unlocks additional features like the ability to “undo” a tweet or browse news without ads, is now available to users in the United States ($2.99/month) and New Zealand ($4.49/month).</p><p>The service is designed to appeal to Twitter’s most dedicated power users, with the kind of specialized features that have sometimes appeared in third-party Twitter clients. For example, Twitter Blue comes with an “undo” feature that’s likely the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-12-twitter-client-brizzly-launches-with-undo-tweet-feature.html">closest thing</a> to an edit button the company will ever make.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A subscription also buys several new customization tools, including the ability to rearrange which features appear as shortcuts in the app’s navigation bar, or the option to choose new color themes and app icons. Subscriptions also buy you early access to new features as Twitter tests them out. For now that includes video upload up to 10 minutes long (videos are capped at 2 minutes for non-paying users) and the ability to pin conversations to the top of your DM inbox. These experimental features “might eventually become available to the rest of Twitter, graduate to a feature of Twitter Blue, or sunset based on feedback we hear from subscribers,” the company says.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/6adbe680-4178-11ec-bfee-6eb5da6042ab" alt="Twitter Blue lets you read news without ads." data-uuid="f48bf64a-8274-385a-aecb-68dc30331907"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Twitter</div></figure><p>Notably, the latest iteration of Twitter Blue also comes with two new features powered by the company’s recent acquisition <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-acquires-scroll-subscription-service-171621757.html">of Scroll</a>, a startup that partnered with publishers to offer ad-free content. Twitter Blue subscribers are now able to access ad-free articles from more than 300 publishers, including <em>The Atlantic</em>, <em>BuzzFeed </em>and <em>Rolling Stone</em>.</p><p>It’s somewhat similar to Google’s AMP or Facebook’s Instant Articles in that articles are meant to load quickly and cleanly. But unlike those programs, where readers are directed to stripped down article pages, Twitter Blue articles will still open directly on the publisher’s website. Tony Haile, the former Scroll CEO who now is the senior director of longform at Twitter, says the company is trying to build “win-win partnerships” with publishers who retain “complete control of the experience.”</p><p>Though the company hasn’t disclosed the terms of these arrangements, a portion of each Twitter Blue subscription goes directly to publishers, Haile said. And subscribers will also get access to a dashboard in the Twitter app that breaks down your news-reading habits and how much revenue your clicks are bringing to the publishers you read most often. “Our goal is to help each publishing partner make 50% more per person than they would’ve made from serving ads to that person.” Twitter writes in a blog post.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/866f6110-4178-11ec-b938-0ec57e61d172" alt="Twitter Blue brings back some of Nuzzel with &#39;top articles.&#39;" data-uuid="f8a0bb1a-041f-368c-8370-d8c6a0d94a21"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Twitter</div></figure><p>Finally, Twitter Blue comes with a “top articles” feature that brings in some functionality from the niche but highly regarded news app Nuzzel, which was<a href="https://siliconangle.com/2021/05/04/twitter-buys-scroll-new-aggregator-nuzzel-way/"> shuttered</a> earlier this year. Like the original app, the new “top articles” feature will curate a list of the top stories shared by people in your Twitter network over the last 24 hours. (Former Nuzzel fans will be happy to learn they can pin the new “top articles” section directly to their nav bar from the in-app settings menu.)</p><p>The expansion of Twitter Blue comes amid a broader shift for the company, which has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-15th-anniversary-140008110.html">shaking up</a> many of its core features for the first time in its 15-year history. Elsewhere, the company has embraced creator-centric features like Super Follows and Ticketed Spaces, and is building out a newsletter platform. Twitter Blue is different, though, because the company is hoping to draw in its most hardcore users rather than attract new voices to its platform.</p><p>But it’s unclear just how many of those users will be willing to pay for those extra features. The company has been testing Twitter Blue in Australia and Canada since early June, but hasn’t shared on early adoption or other metrics for the service, Twitter said Tuesday it will continue to add new features and will be paying close attention to user feedback.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitter-expands-3-dollar-twitter-blue-subscriptions-to-the-us-163018030.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3a2c73ac-207e-49a0-a1fd-87fda513f817</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 16:30:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636486963</ingested><modified>2021-11-09T19:42:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/4a5cf610-4178-11ec-bdfe-6b3c1844134f" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/4a5cf610-4178-11ec-bdfe-6b3c1844134f" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Twitter]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Twitter Blue comes with an "undo" feature.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[tweet undo]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The video games we wish someone would gift us]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We regularly write about the games we love at Engadget, and even have &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/best%20games/">best games</a>&quot; lists for each console.

Because you can finally <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hades-xbox-series-x-xbox-one-ps4-ps5-on-august-13-th-175208533.html">play it on everything</a>. Over the summer, the game launched across both generations of Xbox and Playstation consoles, joining the PC and Switch versions.</p><p>Buy <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Hades" href="https://amzn.to/3FI0F1Y">Hades</a> on PS5 or Xbox Series X, and you’ll get a version that can reach 60 fps in 4K. Whichever platform you play on, expect a game filled with varied enemies, playthroughs that are never the same twice, and an ingenious Boon system that augments a strong selection of weapons with extra powers, effects and new moves.</p><p>You’ll soon decide your favorite godly ally (and weapon of the underworld), but making it to the end of Hades demands you build some affinity for most skills and techniques, as Boons are randomly granted each run. The game centers around dying, learning and doing it all over again. And again.

As it is, it’s still a great time to acquaint yourself with the original which came out — first on PC — back in 2017. Thanks to its Metroidvania playstyle (explore, earn new abilities, use abilities to explore even further) and its cute bug cartoon looks, it remains a classic. To explore the world of Hollow Knight, you’ll need half-decent reflexes to both explore dangerous environments and survive encounters with much bigger bugs. The story is lightly woven into your exploration, and while things can feel a little bleak  — it’s a moody looking game — there’s plenty of funny little moments and characters to meet.</p><p>Depending on your console of choice, it’s also often discounted.
