The carrier has <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-reaches-195m-settlement-t-mobile-911-outage-investigation">agreed to pay</a> $19.5 million to settle an FCC investigation of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-outage-092021962.html">12-hour service outage</a> in June 2020 that led to 911 call failures. While the FCC didn&#39;t know exactly how many emergency calls were affected due to some overlapping issues, it recorded tens of thousands of issues.</p><p>Over 23,000 calls suffered a &quot;complete&quot; failure, the FCC said, while a similar amount didn&#39;t include location data. Roughly another 20,000 didn&#39;t include callback info. The outage began when a leased fiber link in the T-Mobile network went awry, and a single-location routing flaw magnified the crisis. T-Mobile also had problems remotely accessing the fiber link.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This isn&#39;t the first time T-Mobile has dealt with a 911 outage. It settled to the tune of $17.5 million over failures in 2014.</p><p>We&#39;ve asked T-Mobile for comment. The FCC said the carrier responded to outage-related questions in a &quot;timely&quot; fashion, however, so this wasn&#39;t a hotly disputed issue. Not that the company was likely to fight a settlement that won&#39;t significantly impact its finances. And like it or not, this won&#39;t do much to help people who couldn&#39;t get full help in a moment of crisis.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-911-outage-fcc-settlement-230802122.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5d44e36d-89c5-4164-976b-dbe4a0306aeb</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 23:08:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637706433</ingested><modified>2021-11-23T22:27:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6b11cbd0-1700-11ec-94fb-ebcea6d7e402" width="4234" height="2823" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6b11cbd0-1700-11ec-94fb-ebcea6d7e402" width="4234" height="2823" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ARLINGTON, VA - AUGUST 18:  People walk past the front of a T-Mobile retail store on August 18, 2021 in Arlington, Virginia.

The list includes familiar tech names like Apple, Google, Meta (Facebook), Telegram, TikTok and Twitter.</p><p>The law demands local offices for &quot;internet companies&quot; with over 500,000 daily users. Some of the companies already have offices, though, and it&#39;s unclear just what constitutes an official presence. Those deemed violating the law could be subject to either complete bans or limits on their ads, data gathering and money transfers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As you might have guessed, the concern is that Russia might use the law to wield more control over those companies and their content. Russia has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-27-apple-caves-crimea-russia.html">clashed with Apple</a> multiple times, for instance, including a fine for allegedly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/russia-fines-apple-12-million-for-abusing-its-app-store-dominance-115545878.html">abusing App Store dominance</a> — this law might give officials more leverage. The move might also help Russia pressure companies into censoring content the government deems objectionable, such as social media posts backing the political opposition to Putin&#39;s regime.</p><p>The announcement makes a tricky situation that much more difficult. Russia is a significant market some companies can&#39;t always afford to lose but honoring the request could also mean enabling censorship and other rights abuses. Companies may soon have to make decisions that are painful regardless of the outcome.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/russia-tells-tech-companies-to-set-up-in-country-211922268.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ff961470-6b3a-474b-8159-ea4f88f17726</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 21:19:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637702364</ingested><modified>2021-11-23T21:19:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9de01b60-4c99-11ec-befe-f6afb12ce89d" width="5051" height="3334" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9de01b60-4c99-11ec-befe-f6afb12ce89d" width="5051" height="3334" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mikhail Metzel via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[MOSCOW, RUSSIA - NOVEMBER 19, 2021: Russia's President Vladimir Putin holds a meeting with permanent members of the Russian Security Council via video link from the Moscow Kremlin.

The announcement comes less than a year after Reddit <a href="https://www.engadget.com/reddit-bought-tik-tok-rival-dubsmash-113916703.html">acquired</a> the TikTok-like video platform for an undisclosed sum in December 2020. Following the 22nd, Dubsmash won’t be available to download through the App Store or Google Play, nor will the app work after that date.</p><p>When Reddit first announced the acquisition, it said Dubsmash would retain its own platform and brand. “Combining forces has been a perfect match. Reddit is where passionate communities come together for timely, interactive and authentic exchanges about topics that matter to them, and video is increasingly core to how people want to connect,” the company said in a <a href="https://www.redditinc.com/blog/bringing-more-of-dubsmash-to-reddit-by-launching-new-video-features">blog post</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As part of today’s announcement, Reddit is also rolling out new video features that come courtesy of the Dubsmash team. The built-in camera now includes options to change recording speeds and set a timer. Additionally, it’s now possible to upload clips in landscape, portrait mode and fill, as well as adjust and trim multiple clips at once. A new editing screen allows users to add stickers, doodles, voice-overs and filters to their clips.</p><p>The impending shutdown of Dubsmash is likely to affect creators of color most acutely.  Where TikTok’s best-known stars are white, Dubsmash was particularly popular among Black and Latinx users. At the end of 2020, Reddit noted 25 percent of all Black teens in the US were on the platform. Those users now face a tough decision: they either support a platform that has been seen as a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/reddit-211856313.html">safe harbor for hate speech and misinformation</a> or look elsewhere to find a supportive community.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/dubsmash-shutdown-february-22nd-202813243.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">49afd050-9027-40b1-82c5-2858080111f0</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 20:28:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637699296</ingested><modified>2021-11-23T20:28:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/dc678890-4c9a-11ec-bfeb-c7afcb3395d1" width="5261" height="3169" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/dc678890-4c9a-11ec-bfeb-c7afcb3395d1" width="5261" height="3169" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ANKARA, TURKEY - DECEMBER 23: In this photo illustration, a mobile phone screen displays the logo of 'Dubsmash' in front of the 'Reddit" logo in Ankara, Turkey on December 23, 2020.

It was a neo-Western set in space; a noir thriller alongside the spectacle of martial arts action and John Woo-esque shootouts; an existential vision of a broken future where characters were forced to live with their shattered pasts. And on top of all of that, it was propelled by an iconic soundtrack that easily danced between genres. We didn&#39;t have much time in the Bebop-verse — just 26 episodes and a movie — so every second felt like a miracle. How could a live-action Netflix adaptation live up to that?</p><p>Simply put, it doesn&#39;t. While the original show was a love letter to cinema and pop culture, crafted by a creative dream team (director Shinichiro Watanabe, writer Keiko Nobumoto and composer Yoko Kanno), Netflix&#39;s remix is mainly in love with <em>Cowboy Bebop</em>. It wants to remind us of the anime, so much so that it replicates many iconic sequences shot-for-shot, but it doesn&#39;t latch onto what made it so special. It hums the melody, but has no soul. It&#39;s a hollow tune that&#39;s common to nostalgia-focused reboots, like <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em> and <em>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</em>, and it almost always holds them back.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="bbc63d9b46a247f7831ad67ea9f00dd5"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ULCIHP5dc44?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>By almost every measure, I should hate <em>Netflix&#39;s Cowboy Bebop</em> with a passion. But, it&#39;s a testament to the talented actors involved that I don&#39;t. John Cho wouldn&#39;t be my first choice to play the impossibly cool Spike Spiegel (that would be Sung Kang, <em>Fast and Furious&#39;s</em> swagger king Han), but he makes a serious effort to replicate his charm. Mustafa Shakir easily carries Jet Black&#39;s irascible yet lovable nature. And Daniella Pineda&#39;s Faye Valentine is an absolute scene stealer.</p><p>But this talented group is failed by a confounding production, which often looks worse than a cheap Doctor Who episode. Some sets appear to be made out of cardboard and spray paint, nothing conveys the lived-in aesthetic the anime captured so well. There are flashes of visual brilliance, to be clear, but that mainly comes from digital effects that often replicate shots from the original series. At times, <em>Bebop </em>wants to replicate the live-action cartoon aesthetic from the Wachowski&#39;s under-rated <em>Speed Racer</em>. Then, at other times, it will just have a bright neon &quot;PORN&quot; sign in the background, as if that&#39;s enough to convey the seediness of a neighborhood.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/6f91c7c1-4c8c-11ec-8dee-95f2bbe8a747" alt="Cowboy Bebop Netflix" data-uuid="d69c2b7a-57a0-343d-a851-72debdb62923"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Geoffrey Short/Netflix</div></figure><p>So where did everything start going wrong? As with most nostalgia reboots, it usually comes down to the writing. Netflix&#39;s <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> was developed by Christopher Yost (<em>Thor: Ragnarok</em>, <em>Star Wars Rebels</em>) and includes genre talents like Javier Grillo-Marxuach (<em>Lost, Charmed)</em>. Their combined credits gave me hope that the show would be something more than a copycat of the anime, but instead it&#39;s a confusing mishmash of nostalgia worship and superfluous story additions.</p><p>Instead of being a mysterious cutthroat assassin, the villain Vicious comes across as a dull Eurotrash gangster. Instead of a haunting past based on the consequences of being overbearingly protective, Jet gets an estranged daughter and a ticked-off ex-wife. And perhaps most damningly, Spike&#39;s love interest Julia loses her mystique, and instead becomes another pretty damsel in distress. We&#39;ve seen all of these storylines before, so instead of feeling like &quot;a new genre unto itself,&quot; the bold proclamation the anime made in the middle of every episode, it all just feels like &quot;been there, done that.&quot;</p><section data-eng-breakout="82fc733a2f964a74aba24fdd9155a80d" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/6f908f40-4c8c-11ec-b8fd-bb7ee494d85a" alt="Cowboy Bebop Netflix"></section><p>That&#39;s the same vibe I got while watching <em>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</em>. It starts out as an intriguing portrait of a struggling family, but eventually becomes bogged down by replicating almost every plot beat from the first <em>Ghostbusters</em>. It&#39;s still a fun and enjoyable film, but it&#39;s reverence for the past clearly prevented it from doing anything truly new. Watching that movie and <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> over the weekend made me genuinely worried about the future of pop culture. Are we just doomed to repeat the past, over and over again, to appease the fans?</p><p>Now, here&#39;s the thing: Despite all of the ways <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> fundamentally misunderstands its source material, it still ends up being a decently enjoyable sci-fi romp. And if you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re missing, it&#39;s easy to overlook the flaws as you soak in the talent of the cast, the strange yet familiar future filled with terraformed moons and planets, and the catchy Yoko Kanno tunes.</p><p>My one faint hope is that viewers who enjoy the live-action series will also check out the anime, which is also available on Netflix. I&#39;m all for new viewers finding ways into existing properties. I just wish that didn&#39;t involve watering down classics to make them more palatable.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/cowboy-bebop-review-netflix-191548307.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5109a5b7-478e-44ba-86d0-7f4a9fb57515</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 19:15:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637697875</ingested><modified>2021-11-23T20:04:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e31ac840-042f-11ec-bf5d-d4f050df77e4" width="3600" height="2348" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e31ac840-042f-11ec-bf5d-d4f050df77e4" width="3600" height="2348" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Netflix]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A still promoting the new live-action Netflix series 'Cowboy Bebop' showing three people and a corgi walking down a water-slicked back alley.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Cowboy Bebop Netflix]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Epic Games buys Harmonix to create 'musical journeys' in 'Fortnite']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Epic Games has <a href="https://www.harmonixmusic.com/blog/harmonix-is-joining-the-epic-games-family"><ins>acquired Harmonix</ins></a>, the studio behind titles like <em>Guitar Hero</em>, <em>Rock Band</em>, <em>Dance Central</em> and more recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/harmonix-fuser-game-review-160025841.html"><em><ins>Fuser</ins></em></a>.

The move will maintain the &quot;continued safety&quot; of visitors while the museum finishes work on its first new west wing galleries.</p><p>The closure is part of the first phase of a seven-year renovation poised to cost over $1 billion. The Smithsonian is staggering closures to keep at least some physical museum spaces open during that period, including the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Virginia (which will remain open). Some parts of the collection have relocated to other relevant museums in the meantime, such as the Museum of African American History and Culture, the Museum of Natural History and the Museum of the American Indian.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The wait could be worthwhile. Eight west wing exhibits should launch when the main museum reopens, including &quot;One World Connected&quot; (shown above) and spaces touching on the Wright brothers, planetary exploration and the Moon.</p><p>Some parts of the renovation are still far from completion. The museum will start &quot;deinstallation&quot; of the east wing in March and won&#39;t complete its upgrade until sometime in 2025. If you can live with those limitations, though, the Air and Space Museum may soon be more relevant and engaging than in the past — even if you&#39;ve visited relatively recently.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/smithsonian-air-and-space-museum-closed-renovations-182003676.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f193ff1e-845a-416d-8b17-1a034c14269a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 18:20:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637698536</ingested><modified>2021-11-23T20:16:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture Organizations]]></category><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ec711990-4c81-11ec-8ffe-e43800f84d1d" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ec711990-4c81-11ec-8ffe-e43800f84d1d" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Smithsonian Air and Space Museum 'One Connected World' exhibit rendering]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Smithsonian Air and Space Museum 'One Connected World' exhibit rendering]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple sues NSO Group over state-backed spyware]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple is more than a little angry at NSO Group for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-security-flaw-al-jazeera-journalist-spying-215710995.html">developing spyware tools</a>. The iPhone maker has <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/apple-sues-nso-group-to-curb-the-abuse-of-state-sponsored-spyware/">filed a lawsuit</a> against NSO to &quot;hold it accountable&quot; for governments spying on and targeting Apple device users. In addition to punishing NSO, Apple also seeks to ban the surveillance software developer from using Apple products for future research.</p><p>Senior VP Craig Federighi acknowledged that NSO Group&#39;s Pegasus spyware is only aimed at surveilling a small number of people on multiple platforms, including Android. However, Apple stressed that targets are frequently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nso-spyware-targeted-journalists-politicians-190234376.html">activists, journalists</a> and <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/11/palestinian-human-rights-defenders-hacked-nso-groups-pegasus-spyware/">other critics</a> of regimes that routinely suppress political dissent. The company further accused NSO of &quot;flagrant violations&quot; of federal- and state-level laws in the US.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The lawsuit also sheds more light on NSO&#39;s reported &quot;FORCEDENTRY&quot; exploit. According to Apple, intruders pushed FORCEDENTRY by creating bogus Apple IDs to send malicious code without alerting targets. Apple said its servers weren&#39;t compromised in the process, but it clearly wasn&#39;t happy that its account system was used for this surveillance.</p><p>Alongside the lawsuit, Apple is promising to donate $10 million (plus any lawsuit damages) toward groups advocating against or researching this kind of digital surveillance. It&#39;s further promising free engineering, intelligence and technical help for FORCEDENTRY discoverer Citizen Lab and other organizations with similar goals.</p><p>We&#39;ve asked NSO Group for comment. In the past, it has repeatedly maintained that it shuts off access to known abusers. It also denied that Pegasus was used to target murdered Saudi journalist <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-26-khashoggi-saudi-arabia-hacking-team-tech-blood-money.html">Jamal Khashoggi</a>. The Israeli firm has even gone on the offensive, hiring a libel attorney that accused investigators of &#39;misinterpreting&#39; data and otherwise smearing NSO&#39;s reputation.</p><p>NSO might not have many allies. WhatsApp, for instance, accused NSO of enabling <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-nso-spyware-attack-215334253.html">attacks on government officials</a> and rejected the Pegasus creator&#39;s denials. The tech industry sees NSO as a threat to the privacy of its users (and thus its reputation), and it won&#39;t be surprising if other companies support Apple&#39;s case.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-nso-group-spyware-lawsuit-181306004.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">950ff9d1-8427-417b-9197-4b431aac5650</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 18:13:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637693125</ingested><modified>2021-11-23T18:45:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/01f465a0-4c88-11ec-97e7-908b932b2b4c" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/01f465a0-4c88-11ec-97e7-908b932b2b4c" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[JOEL SAGET via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[This studio photographic illustration shows a smartphone with the website of Israel's NSO Group which features 'Pegasus' spyware, on display in Paris on July 21, 2021. - Private Israeli firm NSO Group has denied media reports its Pegasus software is linked to the mass surveillance of journalists and rights defenders, and insisted that all sales of its technology are approved by Israel's defence ministry (Photo by JOEL SAGET / AFP) (Photo by JOEL SAGET/AFP via Getty Images)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[FRANCE-ISRAEL-SECURITY-SPYWARE-PEGASUS]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Android 12 review: Living in a Material (You) world]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="537dfb0d938e4bb4bd09c6e6da247695"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ke67k_7RgKo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Android is forked.

Features like HDR Net videos and white balance controls are also exclusive to Pixels, though that doesn’t mean they won’t one day <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pixel-google-photos-gboard-other-android-devices-160039468.html">roll out more widely</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2><strong>Material You everywhere</strong></h2><p>Functionally, that means there isn’t much obviously different for those on other devices upgrading to Android 12. The biggest change will be the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-material-you-android-personalized-redesign-182501466.html">new Material You design</a>, and how much of that makes its way to your particular handset will depend on your phone’s maker.</p><p>On <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/one-ui-4-update-delivers-an-elevated-mobile-experience-centered-around-you">One UI 4</a>, for example, you’ll get something similar to Material You by way of Samsung’s “whole host of new Color Palettes,” which like Google’s version will apply to menus, buttons and icons. But these aren’t automatically generated by the phone based on your wallpaper, and have a distinct Samsung-y cartoonish style that Galaxy users will find familiar. One UI 4 and Android 12 both also offer new widgets that look much better and offer more customization options than before.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1f25db00-4bd3-11ec-8dbe-c72fd622aab4" alt="Two screenshots showing the Android 12 Material You theme. The first is the Wallpaper &amp; Style settings page, the second screenshot shows the notifications and quick settings shade in the same color palette." data-uuid="89f806bc-933c-3b97-a5f7-3b844c872d47"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>So Android 12 is a nice visual change, but it does go beyond aesthetics and affects how you interact with the system. Sliders and buttons are larger than before, which some might find ugly compared to the cleaner, thinner options of Androids past.</p><p>After living with this new style for a few months, I’ve gotten used to the extra chonky navigational elements. In fact, in some apps, like Clock, the bigger targets are easier to see, and I can hit the Snooze slider more easily from bed. They even look pretty thanks to Material You, which beautifully infuses everything from the Settings shade to keyboards and numpads. I also like that the new lock screen clock takes over the whole display when you don’t have any notifications.</p><p>There’s plenty of little things that Google added throughout Android 12, like new animations across the interface and updated limits to toast dialogs. Those are the little boxes that pop up at the bottom of the screen when you copy text to your clipboard, for example. I’ll focus on just a few of the more obvious changes, starting with the quick settings panel and notification shade.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/8d47b6c0-4bd4-11ec-bef5-d54f97b5f96b" alt="Two screenshots showing the Android 12 Settings and Notifications shade. On the left is the quick settings panel with a couple of notifications, on the right is the expanded settings panel showing the display slider and eight toggles." data-uuid="c1044b03-4ccf-35aa-9e12-372924faad5a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>In general, Google’s been busy decluttering. It removed the redundant “Conversations” and “Notifications” headers from the notifications list that took up extra lines, while using a background color in this area that’s close to the cards, making everything blend more smoothly. The Quick Settings area up top has a black background and just four buttons compared to the six from before, which means you’ll now need an extra swipe to access things like Battery Saver or Auto Rotate toggles. Of course, you can rearrange these to put your favorites first, but you’ll only be able to pick four.</p><p>This is a bummer, but at least when you make that extra swipe in Android 12, you’ll see eight settings shortcuts as opposed to just six. The net convenience lost or gained here is… kinda zero.</p><p>I also don’t love that Android 12 will default to summoning the Google Assistant when you long press the power button, but at least you can revert it to show the restart, shut down, lock and emergency buttons.</p><p>One of the most common ways I interact with my phone is by tapping the search bar at the bottom and typing either the name of an app I want or the show I’m about to watch. Nothing’s changed here since Android 11, you’ll still see your recent entries and suggested apps when you hit the text field. But if you use the search bar in the All Apps drawer, which requires a swipe up, you’ll get Android 12’s universal search. This will let you find things on your phone, including not just apps and contacts, but conversations within supported apps as well.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/e4c68c50-4bd4-11ec-bd99-0f73733b4ec0" alt="A pair of screenshots showing Android 12&#39;s universal search results. On the left are the results for the letter " data-uuid="1e813942-2d86-38cf-9dd2-c32b26309da3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>I randomly hit “D,” and was shown a row of suggested apps, like Discord and Discovery+. Below that was a list of people from various apps, like my colleague Devindra on Gmail, as well as conversations with some guys named Dan and Dylan from Hinge. It also showed actions from specific apps, like “Submit a Front Desk instruction” in my building’s portal and “Connect with Mat Smith” on Duo. When I typed “the,” I got suggestions to order from “The Old Spot” on Uber Eats and quickly hail a ride to “The Westin Grand, Berlin” on Uber. Both are places I’d saved as favorites.</p><p>Finally, at the bottom, you’ll find an option to submit your query to Google’s search engine. Chances that I’ll scroll so far down the list are slim, but at least it gets shorter the more letters entered.</p><h2><strong>More privacy and battery information</strong></h2><p>Most of the changes in Android 12 I’ve described so far are in your face, and you’ll see them as you interact with the system. Others, like the new Privacy Dashboard, are things you’ll have to look for in Settings.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1c5ff250-4bd5-11ec-bf3e-f4490fb44f99" alt="Two screenshots showing the Android 12 Battery and Privacy settings pages. " data-uuid="d2dceef2-a318-3214-b455-2ead6753aed6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>That means they’ll be less impactful on your daily use, but they are, for the most part, informative. The Privacy Dashboard helped me realize that my camera and mic are activated a <em>ton</em> and showed the apps I most often use that require them. And speaking of, Android 12 also provides new indicators for when your mic and camera are being used (a green dot appears in the top right corner of the screen). This is basically the same as on iOS, except Google requires one more tap on the dot to see which app is accessing the sensor.</p><p>While the Battery Usage page isn’t new, it’s now more prominently featured as the first option in the Battery settings panel — you won’t have to tap a separate three-dot button to find it. Google did appear to update the graph showing your power levels for the last 24 hours, with the horizontal axis now poorly labeled with just the numbers 1, 7, 1, 7 and 1 (or 13, 19, 01, 07, 13 on the phone I set to military time) instead of “xx hr ago” and “xx min left”. I found myself ignoring this chart most of the time, since it isn’t all that helpful.</p><p>In the months I’ve been using Android 12, I’ve seen more apps ask for permission to access my specific or approximate location. I almost never selected the latter, but it’s nice to have the option for things like the weather app. In general, though, I relied on the “Allow this time” or “Allow while using” choices as a way to grant limited permissions to apps. Google will also tell you, after some time, which apps you haven’t used in awhile. It’ll automatically revoke permissions for those, which is nice. None of these apps were things I used often enough for this to be a problem.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3ce23e20-4bd5-11ec-9df5-a00615e610e7" alt="Three screenshots showing apps that make use of the Material You color scheme: Clock, Recorder and Calendar. " data-uuid="5ce629a3-f45f-3c20-9080-ce240e2dea95"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>That’s… pretty much it for the major new Android 12 features. I’m still waiting to see an app that uses the new audio-coupled haptic feedback, since I enjoy the sensation it adds to games I’ve played on the iPhone 13 Pro. But there don’t appear to be any at the moment. Google is also constantly pushing out security and stability updates for Android 12, so maybe there are still more features to come.</p><h2><strong>Wrap-up</strong></h2><p>Ultimately, the biggest things Android 12 brings are Material You design and more privacy tools. That might seem minor on paper, but the visual refresh and faster animations throughout the system make it feel drastically different. Plus, Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-updates-locked-folder-night-sight-videos-clipboard-android-safety-160012247.html">continues</a> to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-update-june-2021-starred-messages-earthquake-detection-alert-voice-access-password-160100755.html">drop feature sets</a> every <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-scheduled-text-messages-maps-dark-mode-talkback-screen-reader-auto-password-checkup-170022939.html">quarter or so</a>, meaning each version of Android doesn’t have to be as major of an upgrade. But if you’ve been looking for a fresh face for your phone, Android 12 is a fun, satisfying update.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/android-12-review-material-you-privacy-controls-180010087.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2651d6f6-8c43-47be-89fb-620b26692bf4</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 18:00:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637687905</ingested><modified>2021-11-23T17:18:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9f9e2680-4bd2-11ec-9dfd-844877790d9b" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9f9e2680-4bd2-11ec-9dfd-844877790d9b" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A phone showing the Android 12 easter egg, which is the OS logo on a background of circles themed to the system's color scheme.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Android 12]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nintendo of America head responds to 'distressing' situation at Activision Blizzard]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Add Nintendo to the list of major gaming companies that say they&#39;re disappointed with Activision Blizzard following last week&#39;s bombshell <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-videogames-bobby-kotick-sexual-misconduct-allegations-11637075680"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a> report on the publisher and CEO Bobby Kotick. In an internal company email obtained by <a href="https://www.fanbyte.com/news/nintendo-issues-internal-response-to-activision-blizzard-reports/"><em>Fanbyte</em></a>, Nintendo of America President <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-21-nintendo-president-reggie-fils-aime-retiring.html">Doug Bowser</a> says he was distressed by the allegations detailed in <em>The Journal&#39;s</em> investigation.</p><p>&quot;Along with all of you, I&#39;ve been following the latest developments with Activision Blizzard and the ongoing reports of sexual harassment and toxicity at the company,&quot; Bowser says in the message. &quot;I find these accounts distressing and disturbing. They run counter to my values as well as Nintendo&#39;s beliefs, values and policies.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to <em>Fanbyte</em>, Bowser notes in the letter he&#39;s been in contact with Activision and is in the process of accessing potential &quot;actions.&quot; What those actions may entail, Bowser doesn&#39;t say. However, there&#39;s no mention of reassessing the relationship with Activision like Xbox chief Phil Spencer said was on the table in his <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-phil-spencer-activision-blizzard-203557204.html">message to Microsoft employees</a>. What he does mention is that Nintendo is working with the <a href="https://www.theesa.com/">Entertainment Software Association</a>, a lobbying group that represents both Nintendo and Activision, to strengthen its stance on harassment and workplace abuse.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“Every company in the industry must create an environment where everyone is respected and treated as equals, and where all understand the consequences of not doing so,” he said in the email.</p><p>Bowser reportedly sent the letter on Friday, November 19th, to all levels of the company, including internal development teams like Retro Studios. Nintendo of America later confirmed the authenticity of the email. &quot;We can confirm the content of Doug Bowser&#39;s internal email to Nintendo of America staff is accurate,&quot; a spokesperson for the company told <em>Fanbyte</em>. &quot;We have nothing further to share on this topic.&quot;</p><p>According to <em>The Journal</em>, Kotick knew about many of the incidents of sexual harassment at Activision Blizzard and, at times, acted to protect abusers at the company. He also allegedly acted as one himself at times. In a statement to Engadget, a spokesperson for the company said the article presented a &quot;misleading view of Activision Blizzard and our CEO.&quot; The report drew an outcry from Activision Blizzard employees who <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-call-for-bobby-kotick-resignation-194953539.html">staged a walkout</a> on the day it was published. Some of those same employees have also called on Kotick to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-employees-call-ceo-bobby-kotick-resign-194513764.html">resign from his position</a>, an action the executive <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bobby-kotick-may-reportedly-consider-resigning-from-activision-blizzard-200100900.html">reportedly said he would consider</a> if he can&#39;t fix the company&#39;s culture &quot;with speed.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We respect all feedback from our valued partners and are engaging with them further,&quot; an Activision Blizzard spokesperson told Engadget after the Microsoft letter surfaced online. &quot;We have detailed important changes we have implemented in recent weeks, and we will continue to do so.

The company had dabbled in the app world before with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-10-19-moog-filtatron-app-makes-your-ios-band-seem-almost-plausible.html">Filtatron</a>, which was an emulation of the classic Moog ladder filter. But <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-12-21-animoog-2-0-accelerometer-modulation.html">Animoog</a> was a different beast entirely. It was a full-fledged software instrument that used <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-02-modal-electronics-craftsynth-2-0-hands-on-demo-portable-music.html">wavetable synthesis</a>, often associated with cold and complex digital sounds that are in many ways the antithesis of what Moog stood for. But, the app turned out to be a huge success. And for its tenth anniversary it’s finally getting a proper sequel in Animoog Z.</p><p>The core, which Moog calls Anisotropic Synth Engine, is largely the same. Of the dozens of waveforms you choose up to eight at a time from. They range from samples of analog saw waves to decidedly more digital sounds. What makes it relatively unique is the ‘orbit’ and ‘path’ modules which shape the timbre. The way they work is hard to describe, but basically notes you play travel along a path drawn in space, and orbit around that path. You control the speed and intensity of distance of the orbit, as well as the speed at which it travels along the path and that determines how the sound of each note evolves, in a relatively opaque way.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/43758cd0-4c73-11ec-a7e6-04a9f88b818d" alt="Animoog Z" data-uuid="162eb21c-5181-3bdf-8f74-7168bd7f3d5f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Moog</div></figure><p>The big change here from the original app is that Animoog Z adds a third dimension to the path. So instead of just traveling along an X and Y axis, the notes also can move along this Z axis. This gives the new app just a touch more depth and notes a bit more room to evolve. The difference can be subtle at times, but certain presets in Animoog Z take advantage of additional modulation path to create truly wild and complex sounds. (Just check out Downward Spiral and Ball Lightning.)</p><p>There’s also a  new effects section with a looper, delay, filter, an arpeggiator and a “thick” section. Thick was also in the original app and it just offers a variety of ways to beef up your sound, from adding detune, drive and bit crushing effects. While a few of these are holdovers from the original, the way they’re grouped together here makes sound design a little more fluid and linear.</p><p>The whole app has received a massive face lift that not only makes it feel more modern, but also makes it easier to navigate. While the UI can feel a bit cramped on an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-12-23-animoog-debuts-diy-synth-studio-for-iphone-4-byo-talent-video.html">iPhone</a>, it’s still light years beyond the original. Unfortunately I wasn’t able to test it on an iPad or a Mac, so I can’t speak to how well the interface scales up when it has space to breathe. But, the general layout is clean, logical and consistent.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/4372cdb0-4c73-11ec-bbe7-d7e9aace2646" alt="Animoog Z" data-uuid="958075a7-e440-34ae-a363-1128e558bd84"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Moog</div></figure><p>The LFO, mod and envelope sections are more accessible and more powerful than their counterparts in the original app. In Animoog Z there is an entire tab dedicated to envelopes, with a clearly labeled amp envelope, and you’ll find it in the same place you’ll find the FX, orbit, filter, path and LFO tabs. There’s no need to go searching. In the original some of these features were scattered amongst dropdown menus. There are also just a lot more options for routing modulation in the new app.</p><p>Lastly, Moog added MPE support to the app, and even offers a limited version of it through the touchscreen interface. If you expand the keyboard, you can slide your fingers up and down individual notes to add unique modulation to each. You can also bend each note individually by moving your fingers. One of the great ways to add a little character to your playing is to turn down the keyboard correction and turn up the glide which will just by dint of your imperfect and imprecise human fingers add subtle detuning and bends as you play. With the right settings this can simulate everything from subtle analog drift to the tape warbles of a dying Walkman.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/43745450-4c73-11ec-bbfd-97956623ec9f" alt="Animoog Z" data-uuid="99edc65b-4037-37b3-badf-7e21e06e7e9f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Moog</div></figure><p>Animoog Z is available as a free download, but only in an extremely limited version. You can play the built-in presets and manipulate some basic parameters, but if you want full access to all its features you’ll need to pay $10. One nice change here is the flat price no matter the platform. Currently the iPhone version Animoog is $10, but it’s $20 on the iPad. Animoog Z is $10 no matter where you’re using it.</p><p>Animoog is definitely starting to look and feel its age. So this sequel couldn’t have come at a better time. And Animoog Z is definitely a worthy successor to this groundbreaking app.</p><div id="9271a5d581ad4ac7867020dae439d1e7"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZR0PJ8c8HS4?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/moog-animoog-z-i-os-softsynth-music-app-170019893.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7321ad22-6650-47d8-ab4a-71448a007784</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 17:00:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637683191</ingested><modified>2021-11-23T16:00:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/43758cd0-4c73-11ec-a7e6-04a9f88b818d" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/56643300-4c73-11ec-bfaf-db6c11907338" width="2216" height="1478" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Moog Music]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Animoog Z]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Animoog Z]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Game Boy Advance 'hacked' to run PlayStation games using a Raspberry Pi]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-game-boy-advance-20th-anniversary-150023359.html">Game Boy Advance</a> is useful in the modern era for more than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tenet-game-boy-advance-bob-wulff-christopher-nolan-202848161.html">watching Christopher Nolan blockbusters</a>. <em>Gizmodo</em><a href="https://gizmodo.com/super-powered-cartridge-lets-the-game-boy-advance-run-p-1848109189">notes</a> that tinkerer Rodrigo Alfonso has Nintendo&#39;s 20-year-old handheld <a href="https://github.com/rodri042/gba-remote-play">running</a> PlayStation (and Genesis, and SNES) games without special modifications. The trick, as you might imagine revolves around a custom cartridge — you&#39;re technically running the game on a separate system.</p><p>The cartridge houses a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-14-raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus.html">Raspberry Pi 3</a> mini-computer running the RetroPie emulator and streaming both video and input through the GBA&#39;s multiplayer-oriented Link Port. Yes, that&#39;s constraining as you think it is — you can&#39;t transfer more than 1.6Mbps bi-directionally, and the Pi has to routinely give the &quot;poor&quot; GBA&#39;s processor a break for a few microseconds. Alfonso suggests lowering the stream resolution from the console&#39;s native 240 x 160 if a high frame rate is important.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Still, the results are mostly impressive. The special cart can handle classics like the <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> series and <em>Spyro the Dragon</em> at smooth frame rates, albeit with some video artifacts that reflect the limited bandwidth. You can overclock the GBA&#39;s processor to improve the frame rate and quality.</p><p>You&#39;ll have to build the cartridge and load code yourself, although Alfonso has helpfully provided both <a href="https://github.com/rodri042/gba-remote-play">on GitHub</a>. This probably won&#39;t replace <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wont-stop-selling-psp-games-after-july-2nd-065844351.html">a PSP</a> if you want the most authentic PlayStation handheld experience you can get.

Everything from music and TV streaming to guided meditations to password management has a service that you can pay for to make your life more convenient. These are also things we don&#39;t think about buying very often — typically, you sign up once and only revisit the service when you&#39;re thinking of changing things up or cancelling. But Black Friday is a good opportunity to check out new subscription services you may have considered in the past because many of them have sales for new (and sometimes returning) customers. Here are the best deals on subscription services you can get this Black Friday.</p><h2>Adobe CC All Apps plan</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/7c411d60-46e5-11ec-b7f8-4b5c10881084" alt="Woman editing photo on computer.

If you&#39;re a student, it&#39;s even cheaper — just $16 per month for first-time customers. These programs are considered standard in most creative fields, so it&#39;s worth grabbing this deal if you know you&#39;ll be using things like Photoshop or Illustrator in the future.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><a class="athena-button" href="https://bit.ly/3EVHeBP" id="a15f9c70131c47709817b93465fa8dca" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Adobe;elmt:viglink;pdid:">Subscribe to All Apps plan at Adobe - $30/month</a><h2>Headspace</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/d4f45440-46e5-11ec-bfbf-ee0b432e89b8" alt="Headspace" data-uuid="b34162df-637f-305c-81d9-be2428168b1f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Headspace</div></figure><p>The meditation app <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Headspace" href="https://fave.co/3mQA8Hp">Headspace</a> is down to $5 per month for new and returning customers for Black Friday.

While that sounds useful at first, there&#39;s a concern the initial committee is more symbolic than functional.</p><p>The committee will launch with just two members, both of whom (chair Dawn Ostroff and Reveta Bowers) are existing independent board members. They, in turn, will report to the board and key Activision Blizzard executives — including CEO Bobby Kotick, who some argue is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-employees-call-ceo-bobby-kotick-resign-194513764.html">partly to blame for the scandal</a>. The duo will work with an outside coordinator and a consultant following the company&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-settles-eeoc-18-million-lawsuit-005806200.html">settlement with the EEOC</a>, but there&#39;s no mention of involving regular company staff or outsiders who weren&#39;t part of that court agreement.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As such, it won&#39;t be surprising if the committee does little to satisfy critics. Employees and others have called on Kotick to resign, among other more substantial changes. There&#39;s also low confidence in leadership&#39;s ability to police itself — Jennifer Oneal, Blizzard&#39;s first female leader, allegedly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blizzard-leader-jen-oneal-step-down-mike-ybarra-213704384.html">left her position</a> feeling she was the target of discrimination by a seemingly irredeemable company culture. <em>Bloomberg</em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-11-19/activision-blizzard-s-atvi-board-is-full-of-ceo-bobby-kotick-s-friends?sref=10lNAhZ9">noted</a> that some board members (including Ostroff) are Kotick&#39;s longtime friends and connections, for that matter. The committee might need to take aggressive steps if it wants to prove it&#39;s more than a superficial gesture.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-harassment-committee-151913561.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">257e36a0-f998-4f29-84be-0af1e04ac655</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 15:19:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637680755</ingested><modified>2021-11-23T15:19:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/cdc38340-494b-11ec-87dd-02450f302348" width="4200" height="3073" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/cdc38340-494b-11ec-87dd-02450f302348" width="4200" height="3073" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Allen J.

Sure, they&#39;re not the flashiest gadgets but they&#39;re some of the most useful, providing extra space for photos, documents, games and more in a travel-friendly package. One of our favorites, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Samsung T7 Touch" href="https://amzn.to/3CIagDh">Samsung T7 Touch</a>, is already on sale for Black Friday — the 500GB model is down to $90, or 18 percent off its normal price and only a few dollars more than its all-time low. You can pick up the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:1TB version" href="https://amzn.to/3xdWPtX">1TB version</a> for 21 percent off now that it&#39;s down to $150, or a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:2TB model" href="https://amzn.to/3l2WUM6">2TB model</a> for $300.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3CIagDh" id="09937f1405054f3e836f4c5fc4520158" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy T7 Touch at Amazon starting at $90</a><p>The &quot;Touch&quot; portion of the drive&#39;s name comes from its built-in fingerprint reader that provides an additional defense against prying eyes. The T7 supports optional password protection, but on the Touch, you can choose to use your fingerprint to unlock the device and access saved files. The T7 is physically protected as well with its shock- and drop-resistant body, which is also small enough to fit into nearly any pocket of any bag or backpack.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We also appreciate the use of ePCM technology and Dynamic Thermal Guard to control heat levels, which means that the drive won&#39;t overheat even when you&#39;re pushing it to its limits. And you may do that a lot depending on how you use the drive. It comes with both a USB-C to C cable and a USB-C to A cable, so it can work with most gadgets — including some game consoles. Overall, the T7 Touch is a versatile SSD that&#39;s made better by its extra layer of security.</p><p>If you can forgo the fingerprint reader, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:standard T7 drives" href="https://amzn.to/3Ck7XpV">standard T7 drives</a> have also been discounted to new record-low prices.

What that means in practice is that you have more screen real estate on your wrist, which makes a noticeably difference in usability. Everything is a bit clearer and less cramped, and more things can fit on the screen — like the on-display QWERTY keyboard that the Series 7 has access to in watchOS 8. That lets you type out iMessages whenever you want, although some may still prefer dictation or quick replies to that method.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This Apple Watch also charges a bit faster than previous versions. In our testing, we got 10 percent juice in just 10 minutes of charging, and the Watch was fully powered in under an hour. This will undoubtably come in handy if you forget to place your Watch in its charger overnight, or if you make use of Apple&#39;s sleep tracking feature and want to power up before heading out for the day.</p><p>Otherwise, the Series 7 is the most comprehensive Apple Watch to date. You&#39;re getting all of the sensors and features possible here including a blood oxygen sensor, an ECG measurement tool, GPS, heart rate monitor, altimeter and more. Also, you&#39;re getting an always-on display, which makes it easier to check notifications without raising your wrist. If you&#39;ve had your eye on the Series 7 since it was announced, this is the best deal we&#39;ve seen on it since then. However, those who can give up things like an always-on display and bloody oxygen and ECG tracking, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Apple Watch SE" href="https://amzn.to/3cAA7Ti">Apple Watch SE</a> may be the better option since it&#39;s also on sale for an all-time low of $219.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

According to the watchdog, the two companies signed an agreement in 2018 that would prohibit both official and unofficial resellers of Apple and Apple-owned Beats products on Amazon&#39;s Italian website. That agreement allegedly contained contractual clauses that only allowed Amazon itself and select sellers &quot;chosen individually and in a discriminatory way&quot; to sell those items.</p><p>AGCM said in its announcement that those clauses violate article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. In addition, the watchdog said the agreement restricted cross-border sales, ultimately limiting buyers&#39; options and depriving them of the discounts typically offered by third-party sellers. The Italian authority <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-apple-italy-antitrust-investigation-141046089.html">opened</a> the antitrust case against both companies in 2020 and even searched their offices in the country.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A total of 70 percent of consumer electronics purchases in the country are from Amazon, AGCM explained, and 40 percent were purchases from sellers that use the website as their main platform. That&#39;s why it&#39;s essential for Amazon to implement Italy&#39;s competition rules and ensure a level playing field for all sellers, as well as to ensure that buyers have access to more options.</p><p>AGCM imposed a fine of €68.7 million (US$77 million) on Amazon and a fine of €134.5 million (US$151.2 million) on Apple. It also ordered the companies to end the restrictions and allow the sale of Apple and Beats products on Amazon Italy in &quot;non-discriminatory manner.&quot; In a statement sent to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/italys-antitrust-fines-amazon-apple-more-than-200-mln-euros-alleged-collusion-2021-11-23/"><em>Reuters</em></a>, Amazon called the imposed penalty &quot;disproportionate and unjustified.&quot; A spokesperson said in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We reject the suggestion that Amazon benefits by excluding sellers from our store, since our business model relies on their success. As a result of the agreement, Italian customers can find the latest Apple and Beats products on our store, benefiting from a catalogue that more than doubled, with better deals and faster shipping.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Meanwhile, Apple denied any wrongdoing:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;To ensure our customers purchase genuine products, we work closely with our reseller partners and have dedicated teams of experts around the world who work with law enforcement, customs and merchants to ensure only genuine Apple products are being sold.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>According to <em>Reuters</em>, both companies are planning to appeal the watchdog&#39;s penalty.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-apple-fined-228-million-italy-restricting-beats-sales-123325114.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b51f0908-6fa4-453d-8742-b074ed6d5ba2</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 12:33:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637670878</ingested><modified>2021-11-23T12:34:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/a86b77c0-4c51-11ec-bbfe-527302eb48ec" width="3500" height="2308" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/a86b77c0-4c51-11ec-bbfe-527302eb48ec" width="3500" height="2308" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Andrew Matthews - PA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[General view of a pair of beats Mixr headphones alongside an Apple iPhone 5, as Apple will make the most expensive acquisition in its history, after confirming a deal to buy Dr Dre's Beats Electronics for 3 billion dollars (&pound;1.78 billion).
