First noted on Reddit, the US Apple Store now requires buyers to verify their status via UNiDAYS to be able to purchase MacBooks, iPads and other devices from its education portal. The change appears to have happened over the past few days.</p><p>I’m based in the UK, where Apple has long required proof through the UNiDAYS platform to nab that often substantial discount on some of the company’s priciest devices. For legitimate students and teachers, you’ll have to click through to the UNiDAYS&#39; partner page for Apple first and sign in before you get to those discounts. Not that anyone can go too crazy: shoppers are limited to one desktop, one Mac mini, one laptop, two iPads and two accessories per year.

He said his team detected unauthorized transactions made from the accounts, but that they&#39;d fixed the issue immediately and fully reimbursed the affected users. Now, the company has <a href="https://crypto.com/product-news/crypto-com-security-report-next-steps">published</a> a report revealing details from its post mortem. Apparently, 483 accounts were affected and the unauthorized withdrawals totaled 4,836.26 ETH, 443.93 BTC and approximately $66,200 in other currencies. Based on current exchange rates, that&#39;s $15.3 million of ETH and $18.7 million of ETC for a total of $34 million in losses.&nbsp;</p><div id="a702d347c9d2468a913f497f4f365d30"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">JUST IN: CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptocom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@cryptocom</a>’s Kris Marszalek discusses the site&#39;s recent hack with <a href="https://twitter.com/BloombergTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BloombergTV</a>’s <a href="https://twitter.com/emilychangtv?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@emilychangtv</a>. &quot;Customer funds were never at risk.&quot; <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheYearAhead?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TheYearAhead</a><a href="https://t.co/YlCtGO60t5">pic.twitter.com/YlCtGO60t5</a></p>— Bloomberg Live (@BloombergLive) <a href="https://twitter.com/BloombergLive/status/1483841347824099330?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>Before the company revealed the scope of the hack in terms of lost funds, blockchain security analytics company PeckShield Inc. <a href="https://twitter.com/peckshield/status/1483246262371557378">said</a> Crypto.com may have lost cryptocurrency worth $15 million. At least 4,600 of the coins lost were Ethereum, and half of them are reportedly being washed — a process that obfuscates a coin&#39;s transaction trail. Meanwhile, Bitcoin research firm OXT Research said the company&#39;s loss might be worth <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-com-breach-may-be-worth-up-to-33m-suggests-onchain-analyst">up to $33 million</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The report explained that the company&#39;s risk monitoring systems detected unauthorized activity a few days ago, wherein transactions were being approved without two-factor authentication for a small number of accounts. As a result, the cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptocom/status/1482936866001207296">paused</a> withdrawals on the evening of January 16th. Indeed, people in the comments on its Twitter announcement revealed that they had funds stolen even if they had 2FA enabled.&nbsp;</p><p>In another <a href="https://twitter.com/Kris_HK/status/1483277350683185155">tweet</a> posted on January 17th, Marszalek said that &quot;no customer funds were lost,&quot; the company&#39;s infrastructure was down 14 hours and that his team strengthened its security in response to what happened. The report expounded on that last part, revealing that Crypto.com revoked all customer 2FA tokens and implemented additional security measures that required all account users to re-log-in. The company said the move is necessary, because it migrated to a completely new 2FA infrastructure. However, it intends to eventually move away from 2FA and to true Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).</p><p>Crypto.com has also introduced an additional security measure that requires users to wait 24 hours before they can withdraw to a newly registered whitelisted address. Finally, the company is launching the Worldwide Account Protection Program (WAPP) on February 1st for users who want additional protection for their funds.&nbsp;</p><p>WAPP can restore up to $250,000 of a participating user&#39;s money in case a third-party gains access to their account.

It strongly resembles <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canon-eos-r5-review-150038797.html">Canon&#39;s EOS R5</a> mirrorless camera, but has a big hump in back to accommodate an active cooling system. As such, it offers most of the benefits of the EOS R5 with none of the overheating issues when shooting 8K or high frame rate 4K video.&nbsp;</p><p>On the video side, the EOS R5C can shoot 8K at up to 60fps in Canon&#39;s 12-bit RAW LT format using the entire width of the sensor, a big step up from the 8K 30p RAW available on the R5. Better still, it can work at that setting &quot;indefinitely,&quot; while the R5 is limited to just 20 minutes at 8K 30p due to overheating issues. It can also handle RAW 5.9K/60p with a Super 35mm crop, 2.9K/120p with a Super 16 crop, and 4K at up to 120 fps with no crop and full AF capability.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="1eb9fe77-e973-4f97-82a7-f92438c1b8d9"/><p>It also supports ProRes RAW output to an external recorder via the HDMI port at up to 8K/30P. &quot;Proxy data can also be simultaneously recorded to an SD card in-camera, helping to provide efficient post-production operations,&quot; Canon said. Unfortunately, it uses micro HDMI rather than a full-sized port — not ideal for a dedicated cinema camera.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike the R5, however, the R5C doesn&#39;t have in-body stabilization — so any optical shake reduction for stills or video will only be available via supported lenses. However, the optical lens stabilization can work in concert with Canon&#39;s electronic stabilization, with a 1.1x image crop.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/334449e4-79ce-11ec-b5ef-64c639f9e851" style="height:1034;width:2100;" alt="Canon EOS R5C cinema camera press images" data-uuid="e1a20b3d-a0b8-35ff-aa40-b416f95e9a68"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Canon</div></figure><p>There&#39;s one other notable limitation. Because the EOS R5C uses the same LP-E6NH batteries as the R5, it doesn&#39;t have enough power to operate the lens mount in certain video modes (8K and 5.9K above 30p and 2.9K Super 16 above 60fps). That means you lose autofocus at those settings on battery power only, though you can get it back by using external power from Canon&#39;s PD-E1 USB power supply or its new DC coupler.&nbsp;</p><p>On the photography side, the full-frame 45-megapixel sensor is a big plus, as is the 20 fps shooting speed in electronic shutter mode (12 fps with the mechanical shutter). It uses Canon&#39;s Dual Pixel autofocus system for both stills and video, along with eye/face detection and subject tracking, so it should offer the same excellent AF performance as the R5. When you flip the camera over to photo mode, all the menus and button settings change accordingly.&nbsp;</p><div id="7dea17a322d34683ac19abf4fb95e485"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eCQ1cqxvur4?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>It comes with a 3.2-inch variable-angle flip out LCD monitor and 5.76 million-dot viewfinder, the same as the EOS R5. While you get Canon Log 3 for improved dynamic range, the superior Log 2 option found on other Canon cinema cameras isn&#39;t available. Other features include dual card slots (one CFexpress and one SD UHS-II), animal eye detection (cats, dogs, or birds), vehicles detection, a multifunction shoe for microphones and other accessories, a timecode terminal for multi-cam shoots and a DC coupler to provide continuous power.</p><p>The EOS R5C will arrive in March for $4,499, a $600 premium over the R5. It&#39;s a pretty interesting model as it can do more than some Canon cinema camera models for a lot less money and is much smaller, to boot. At the same time, it might give photo/video hybrid shooters serious pause if they&#39;re looking to buy Sony&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a1-review-8k-mirrorless-camera-video-143023884.html">$6,500 A1 hybrid</a>.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/canons-eos-r-5-c-offers-8-k-video-and-45-megapixel-photos-with-no-cooling-issues-090819863.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ce25dd8f-3906-4353-a9ee-b9c96ca6da36</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 09:08:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642670449</ingested><modified>2022-01-20T09:21:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/95cf3e90-79c8-11ec-bdff-962f30bfa2da" width="2100" height="1316" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/95cf3e90-79c8-11ec-bdff-962f30bfa2da" width="2100" height="1316" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Canon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Canon's EOS R5C offers 8K video and 45-megapixel photos with no cooling issues]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Canon's EOS R5C offers 8K video and 45-megapixel photos with no cooling issues]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Shenmue' anime premieres February 5th on Crunchyroll]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <em>Shenmue</em> anime series is almost here, over a year after it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/shenmue-anime-crunchyroll-004323457.html">announced</a> at the Virtual Crunchyroll Expo.

It also received a Medical Device Regulation (MDR) certificate in Europe, allowing patients and medical staff to use the device more widely. Finally, it&#39;s taken a step closer to personal exoskeletons with additional funding.</p><p>The last time I saw Wandercraft&#39;s first-generation exoskeleton was over <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-27-wandercraft-exoskeleton-paraplegic-help-walk.html">four years ago</a>, which is ages in the field of robotics. However, I recently got a chance to see the latest model in use with paraplegic patients, and chat with them and the team behind Atalante.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/76f39e80-7973-11ec-b3f9-55ea665fbcd3" alt="Wandercraft Atalante exoskeleton" data-uuid="de656013-2588-3a69-991a-6ac01bc3ca1e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-04-mind-controlled-robotic-exoskeleton-paralysis.html">Exoskeletons</a> (or exos, as they&#39;re called in the industry) are powered &quot;wearable robots&quot; adapted to each user, designed to aid in walking rehabilitation treatments and restore a patient&#39;s mobility. Atalante is Wandercraft&#39;s second-generation exo with a more advanced design and features than the original model. It comes with a remote to operate it and a new app that lets a physiotherapist and patient fine tune movements and exercise programs. It uses two sets of removable batteries that allow for continuous use.</p><p>The latest model is much smaller, more streamlined and more comfortable for patients, thanks to new hardware, tweaks in the fit and more intelligent software. It&#39;s now self balancing, so it&#39;s easier to control for both patients and physiotherapists. Although it&#39;s not yet approved to be used alone, Wandercraft showed me a video demonstrating that it can self balance, even when shoved off kilter. It also offers features that make it easier to get in and out, along with the &quot;Wander Balance&quot; feature that allows for easy &quot;verticalization&quot; to help the patient stand up.</p><iframe src="https://www.yahoo.com/wandercraft-gait-video-073827881.html?format=embed&amp;region=US&amp;lang=en-US&amp;site=engadget&amp;player_autoplay=false" width="640" height="360" data-yom-embed-source="{media_id_1:70e530b0-f9d6-3361-8835-180ea0d3db68}" data-yahoo-uuid="70e530b0-f9d6-3361-8835-180ea0d3db68" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" id="4b27c583c1f247879c8dcd543efd6ec2"></iframe><p>&nbsp;The device automatically generates optimized and adjustable kinematics according to a each patient&#39;s morphology, with the settings allowing for custom exercises. The latest feature is &quot;RealGait&quot; (shown above) which allows for physiological walking with adjustable speeds. &quot;CustomGait&quot; allows the pace, step length and mass center to be changed, while &quot;ActiveGait&quot; lets the user change the assistance effort from 0 to 100 percent. That feature also includes an &quot;EarlyGait&quot; setting for first steps, along with the new RealGait setting.&nbsp;</p><p>Those features, plus smaller changes make Atalante far more useful. &quot;We&#39;ve  improved half turns so they happen on a spot rather than taking up a lot of space,&quot; Wandercraft CEO Matthieu Masselin told me. &quot;We&#39;ve redesigned things like the attachments and padding. That allows the patient to get in an out more quickly, move more comfortably and get more walking done in each session — which means more rehabilitation and re-education benefits.&quot;</p><p>All of that is enabled by numerous sensors and software that can make adjustments on the fly, Wandercraft told me. The device&#39;s &quot;sense of balance&quot; makes the various gait patterns possible, while also giving the patient and physiotherapist confidence that the device (which is still not light at 130 pounds) won&#39;t tip over.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e2c68130-7974-11ec-a7bb-3295c210c454" alt="Wandercraft Atalante exoskeleton" data-uuid="1e0006aa-b782-3954-b642-3ca5bfa4956a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>Wandercraft allows some patients to use Atalante for rehabilitation purposes and I saw it in action with Arbiha, a paraplegic patient who has used it for multiple sessions. The device was suspended from the ceiling and operated by a physiotherapist for safety reasons, but the plan is to one day have a version that can be used in the real world without assistance.&nbsp;</p><p>It was striking how easily she was able to walk during a relatively long one hour session. The exo therapy offers some clear benefits like stimulation of the cardiovascular/lymphatic systems and training for the arms and other supporting muscles, but it goes well beyond that.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/adfa7690-7975-11ec-b1be-062b929303aa" alt="Wandercraft Atalante exoskeleton" data-uuid="6bd890d5-7c1c-36f9-b331-30db02925292"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>&quot;It boosts both my body and my spirits,&quot; Arbhia told me. &quot;It gives me a cardiovascular workout that I couldn&#39;t get otherwise.

Starting this year, the outlet will add an additional two points to a car’s overall score if its included driver assistance system encourages safe driving. Moving forward, it will also deduct points from a vehicle’s total score if it finds the opposite is true, starting with two points in 2024 and then four points in 2026 and beyond.</p><p>“We believe it&#39;s time to recognize vehicles that have found a safer way to deploy this technology,” said Jake Fisher, senior director of the publication’s Auto Test Center. By its own estimation, <em>Consumer Reports</em> says an adequate driver monitoring system is one that will “reliably” detect when the driver has become inattentive and alert them to that fact. It adds the system should escalate those warnings and eventually stop the car if it finds they’re not responding.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Consumer Reports</em> said it would also take into account an automaker’s privacy policy when evaluating a driver monitoring system, and may not award additional points in some instances. The outlet reasons strong privacy protections are essential to convince drivers to use the feature.</p><p>The outlet<em>&nbsp;</em>will put the new ranking guidelines into action when reveals<em>&nbsp;</em>its<em>&nbsp;</em>2022 Autos Top Picks<em>&nbsp;</em>on February 17th, but it gave an early preview of what to expect on Thursday, noting only cars from Ford and GM earned additional points for their driver assistance features. The outlet said BMW, Ford, GM, Tesla and Subaru all claim their systems can detect and prevent driver inattention, but notes it found some “serious flaws” in those systems through its testing.</p><p>Beyond mentioning the automaker, <em>Consumer Reports</em> didn’t call out Tesla specifically, but the two have an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-21-tesla-model-3-consumer-reports-recommendation.html"><ins>adversarial history</ins></a>. In 2020, <em>Consumer Reports </em>ranked Autopilot a “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-autopilot-second-to-gm-super-cruise-consumer-reports-151025030.html"><ins>distant second</ins></a>” to GM’s Super Cruise. At the time, it said GM’s system was better at notifying drivers when it was about to disengage, and the automaker’s use of an infrared camera to monitor the driver led to a safer system overall.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/consumer-reports-driver-monitoring-050056768.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e4a245cb-6c1e-49ad-b991-4f81679f89d3</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 05:00:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642632850</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T22:54:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/c23c1040-1aae-11eb-9acb-4b8d39a25eae" width="1920" height="1097" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/c23c1040-1aae-11eb-9acb-4b8d39a25eae" width="1920" height="1097" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Roberto Baldwin/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tesla Model 3 in the desert]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tesla Model 3 in the desert]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google Play Games are available on Windows in a three-country beta]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You can now play <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-play-games-are-coming-to-windows-pcs-in-2022-030736542.html">Google Play Games on Windows</a> — if you live in the right country.

CONCACAF (Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football) has <a href="https://www.concacaf.com/news/concacaf-to-use-var-in-multiple-competitions-in-2022/">revealed</a> it will use VAR to help refs in numerous 2022 competitions.

Enthusiasts are concerned the requests for video reviews can slow down matches, and that the use of centralized review hubs could be used to skew decisions. Soccer already has plenty of drama over tackles and handballs, they argue — VAR just draws out those disputes and takes away from the thrill of the game.</p><p>However, the arguments against the system appear to have lost some momentum. VAR helped reverse 17 out of 20 bad calls during the 2018 World Cup, and some backers have contended that video reviews would have overturned other mistakes if they had been used more consistently. Like it or not, tech is more likely to loom in the background of soccer matches than it has before.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/concacaf-var-2022-tournaments-fifa-world-cup-qualifiers-222029398.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">18c8b123-0764-44fe-ac7c-d77da5e71030</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 22:20:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642630616</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T22:17:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Financials Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Soccer]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/d02d1930-796f-11ec-beef-744495260b9a" width="2538" height="1817" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/d02d1930-796f-11ec-beef-744495260b9a" width="2538" height="1817" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[ALFREDO ESTRELLA via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Canada's Richie Laryea (L) and Mexico's Jesus Corona (R) vie for the ball during their Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup Concacaf qualifier match at the Azteca Stadium, in Mexico City, on October 7, 2021.

The dual-motor trailer not only reduces the burden on the towing vehicle, but can be remote-controlled from your phone to help you hitch up, reverse or simply move your camp site. You can even use the motors to shift the weight distribution, so you might not need a special hitch to handle certain trailer loads.</p><p>The other concept, the Thor Vision Vehicle, is a Ford Transit-based <a href="https://www.engadget.com/electric-brands-ebussy-194041042.html">electric RV</a>.

A Nanoleaf spokesperson told Engadget the company won&#39;t update the device with new features, but it does have future firmware updates planned. &quot;Technology is always advancing and we want to be able to offer the best we can but because Light Panels have older technology (created before Thread) they will not be able to support Thread,&quot; they said.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Should you need replacement parts for your tiles, Nanoleaf will offer those until the end of 2023.

But many challenges, from designing cars that can easily hold the fuel, to setting up reliable hydrogen distribution, have made it difficult to turn that dream into a reality. But what if you used those fuel cells to set up a remote EV charging station, or to replace a traditional gas or diesel generator for a large camp? That&#39;s what GM is planning to do with its HYDROTEC fuel cell technology, the <a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2022/jan/0119-hydrotec.html">company announced today</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/2a6b5de0-7965-11ec-8391-9e184bc110b3" style="height:1316;width:2000;" alt="GM fuel cell mobile power generator" data-uuid="d8ffca3e-d770-31a7-9ee2-86c167f2dc00"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">GM</div></figure><p>GM&#39;s Mobile Power Generators, or MPGs, are pretty self descriptive: they&#39;d basically let you bring large amounts of electricity anywhere without burning fossil fuels, or expanding a local power grid. It could be useful for concerts, movie sets, or neighborhoods that frequently lose power. (In my town outside of Atlanta, almost everyone owns a gas generator to deal with storm-related outages.)&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The announcement also makes plenty of sense for GM, as it&#39;s already bringing its fuel cell technology to <a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/jan/0127-navistar.html">trucking</a>, <a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/jun/0617-hydrotec.html">aerospace</a> and <a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/jun/0615-wabtec.html">rail partners</a>. The company says the MPGs will be able to spit out 60 to 600 kilowatts without producing much noise or heat.</p><p>GM plans to show off an MPG-powered EV charging station in the middle of 2022, a project co-funded by the Michigan Economic Development Corporation and the U.S. Army. Additionally, the California Energy Commission is exploring how MPGs could help provide energy during power shutdowns. GM is also working together with Renewable Innovations to build the EMPOWER rapid charger, which could deliver fast EV charging to existing stations without the need for huge infrastructure improvements. Taking things to an even more extreme level, there&#39;s a large MPG implementation that could potentially power large military camps and heavy-duty equipment. (And as a bonus, those camps can actually use the water the MPG emits.)</p><p>While it&#39;ll likely be years before MPGs can actually deployed, it&#39;s heartening to see GM explore uses for fuel cells outside of cars. Battery-powered EVs have evolved so quickly that hydrogen-powered cars don&#39;t have much of a future (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/toyota-second-generation-mirai-hydrogen-fuel-cell-electric-vehicle-060056654.html">sorry, Toyota</a>). So it&#39;s about time we start considering other ways fuel cells could help.</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/gm-hydrotec-hydrogen-fuel-cell-power-generator-202526346.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b292db60-0c5d-44d0-9a47-c5a4aa7318fd</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 20:25:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642623927</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T20:25:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Renewable Energy & Energy Saving]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/2a6b5de1-7965-11ec-81ad-aa410a11851b" width="2000" height="1005" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/2a6b5de1-7965-11ec-81ad-aa410a11851b" width="2000" height="1005" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[GM]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[GM fuel cell mobile power generator]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[GM fuel cell mobile power generator]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[President Biden signs memo to help improve military cybersecurity]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>President Biden is following his <a href="https://www.engadget.com/white-house-eo-network-security-010757835.html">executive order on cybersecurity</a> with more concrete action.

The notice sets firmer requirements, both for schedules and for the technology needed to lock down government data.</p><p>The memo lets the NSA require agencies to take &quot;specific actions&quot; in response to threats and security flaws, and asks the NSA to coordinate with Homeland Security on directives. Agencies will also have to identify their national security systems, report incidents and secure tools that transfer data between classified and unclassified systems. The President&#39;s move also sets timelines and guidance for implementing technologies required in the executive order, ranging from encryption to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-protect-2-factor-140044867.html">multi-factor authentication</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Biden&#39;s move complements an order that was initially signed in response to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/russia-captures-hacker-likely-responsible-for-colonial-pipeline-012541371.html">critical infrastructure cyberattacks</a>. In theory, this will tighten security at some of the most sensitive federal government institutions. As with the order, though, the memo can only accomplish so much without Congress&#39; support. Virginia Senator Mark Warner, for instance, used the signing to <a href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/pressreleases?ID=31242E15-8C6F-4C37-AEAB-16F580B48C20">ask Congress</a> to pass legislation requiring notices of critical infrastructure breaches within 72 hours.</p><p>The timing is apt, at least. The President&#39;s effort comes as tensions rise between Russia, the US and American allies, with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ukraine-blames-russia-for-cyberattack-151210108.html">Ukraine blaming Russia</a> for a string of cyberattacks that knocked out government websites. The situation might not lead to outright cyberwarfare, but the US still has a strong incentive to close as many security holes as possible.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/biden-memorandum-cybersecurity-defense-intelligence-195058392.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ecedc632-9ed4-4ef5-8ea0-a5ca71886611</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 19:50:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642624209</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T20:30:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/93f53bf0-795b-11ec-9ff3-8b1d83be1a09" width="5568" height="3712" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/93f53bf0-795b-11ec-9ff3-8b1d83be1a09" width="5568" height="3712" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[US President Joe Biden speaks about how the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will rebuild the US and the progress made since he signed the bill into law, in the South Court Auditorium of the White House in Washington, DC, on January 14, 2022.

What started as Google Apps <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-09-29-google-for-work-has-a-new-name-g-suite.html"><ins>became G Suite</ins></a> and is now known as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-workspace-rebrand-gmail-logo-105013517.html"><ins>Workspace</ins></a>. Over that same timeframe, the company has offered just as many ways to access that software, announcing new subscription plans while doing away with older ones. It now plans to sunset a tier that had survived the suite’s most recent rebranding.</p><p>In an email spotted by <a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/01/19/g-suite-legacy-free-edition/"><em><ins>9to5Google</ins></em></a>, the company told Workspace administrators it won’t offer G Suite legacy free edition as of <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/60217#faq&amp;zippy=%2Chow-does-the-upgrade-affect-my-current-g-suite-legacy-free-edition-subscription"><ins>July 1st, 2022</ins></a>. The company plans to transition those users to paid accounts starting on May 1st. Google says it will automatically select a subscription plan for users who don’t pick one on their own by the start of May, noting it will look at their current usage when making the decision. Any individual or organization the company migrates to a paid subscription plan automatically won’t be billed for at least two months. However, the company says it will suspend the accounts of individuals and organizations that don’t input their billing information by July 1st.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Business and enterprise Workspace accounts start at a monthly cost of $6 per user.

Its C-Band 5G services are live in &quot;limited parts&quot; of eight metro areas, including Detroit and Chicago as well as Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston in Texas. Folks in three regions in Florida — Jacksonville, Orlando and South Florida — can also use AT&amp;T&#39;s C-Band network.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Verizon (Engadget&#39;s former parent company) says that 100 million more people will gain access to its 5G Ultra Wideband network this month in more than 1,700 cities, including C-Band coverage. So, most metro areas should have at least some C-Band 5G coverage from Verizon in the coming weeks.</p><p>The C-Band spectrum has more bandwidth than the low-band spectrum AT&amp;T and Verizon used in their previous 5G rollouts. That should enable faster download and upload speeds than earlier iterations of 5G. Verizon claims its C-Band 5G is up to 10 times faster than 4G LTE, with download speeds that have exceeded 1 Gbps in some areas.</p><p>AT&amp;T and Verizon initially planned to switch on C-Band 5G in December, but they pushed back the activation following concerns from the FAA and airlines. The companies <a href="https://www.engadget.com/att-verizon-delay-5g-rollout-airports-203850079.html"><ins>said on Tuesday</ins></a> that, even though 40 other countries have enabled C-Band 5G without issue, they are voluntarily delaying the rollout near several airports. Earlier this month, the two said they&#39;d <a href="https://www.engadget.com/faa-5g-buffer-zones-airports-133305569.html"><ins>create buffer zones</ins></a> around 50 airports.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/att-verizon-c-band-5g-rollout-182958225.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2890bb92-e776-4be6-9e81-d595bda0edc2</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 18:29:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642617000</ingested><modified>2022-01-20T06:43:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e46300b0-7954-11ec-b3da-c0aa45c25a4d" width="3918" height="2616" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e46300b0-7954-11ec-b3da-c0aa45c25a4d" width="3918" height="2616" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Justin Sullivan via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA  - JANUARY 18: A United Airlines plane flies by a cellular tower as it takes off from San Francisco International Airport  on January 18, 2022 in San Francisco, California.

The video is, unsurprisingly, packed with gorgeous visuals while offering some details on what seems to be a solid expansion of <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>&#39;s rich story.</p><div id="da8fe0a1d6264859b423b68a90c0b568"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UxDWGW7Z67I?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>&quot;People are suffering. Soon, they&#39;ll starve,&quot; protagonist Aloy (Ashly Burch) says at the beginning of the trailer. &quot;The machines, meant to help us, are out of control. I have to find a way to fix it all. The answer is somewhere out in the Forbidden West.&quot; We soon learn that, in that part of the world, war is the order of the day, so Aloy clearly has another difficult journey ahead.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Along with some familiar faces like Varl and Erend, there are some new characters in the trailer — both friendly and hostile ones. Angela Bassett plays one of the antagonists, Regalla. She&#39;s a rebel leader who &quot;seeks to slaughter all those who&#39;ve wronged her&quot; and has the ability to control the machines, granted to her by a returning character. The three-minute clip closes with a glimpse of a mysterious character named Tilda. Guerrilla Games told <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/01/19/breaking-down-the-new-horizon-forbidden-west-trailer-with-guerrilla-games"><em>Game Informer</em></a> that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-matrix-resurrections-review-160043378.html"><em>The Matrix</em></a> star Carrie-Anne Moss plays her.</p><p>Of course, some of the machines Aloy will battle appear in the clip too. Among them is a terrifying, giant cobra-rattlesnake hybrid called the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/12/27/horizon-forbidden-west-introducing-the-mighty-slitherfang">Slitherfang</a>, which can spit streams of acid in her direction.</p><p>Overall, the trailer offers another tantalizing look at a hotly anticipated game. Given that an unfinished build <a href="https://www.engadget.com/horizon-forbidden-west-leak-185242744.html">reportedly leaked</a> earlier this month, it&#39;s best for fans to tread carefully to avoid spoilers before <em>Horizon Forbidden West </em>arrives on February 18th.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/horizon-forbidden-west-story-trailer-carrie-anne-moss-ps4-ps5-172519361.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a7bdf299-75c3-43a8-8205-cbf2348035e0</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 17:25:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642612355</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T17:12:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/396cae00-7949-11ec-996c-b44150481fc9" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/396cae00-7949-11ec-996c-b44150481fc9" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Guerrilla Games/PlayStation Studios ]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Carrie-Anne Moss as Tilda in Horizon Forbidden West.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Horizon Forbidden West]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cheeky hack-and-slash RPG ‘Nobody Saves the World’ is available now]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After being pushed back from its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nobody-saves-the-world-annoucement-185546511.html"><ins>original 2021 release date</ins></a>, Drinkbox Studios’ playful shape-shifting RPG is available at last on Xbox and PC.</p><p>From the makers of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-04-10-guacamelee-review.html"><em><ins>Guacamelee</ins></em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-05-severed-gets-a-lavish-ps-vita-physical-release.html"><em><ins>Severed</ins></em></a>, <em>Nobody Saves the World</em> is crammed with Drinkbox’s signature self-aware humor and vivid art style while paying homage to classic RPGs from the 90s. Inspired by Final Fantasy Tactic’s Job system, the game’s titular hero Nobody can shapeshift into 18 different off-kilter forms including an egg, slug, and even a bodybuilder to complete quests and clear out dungeons.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="26ea15772bc7440ebee7b930ceeddd93"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H_E1RhtzDHM?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The game’s overworld and top-down aesthetic will be immediately familiar to fans of other classics like <em>Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. </em>Drinkbox also tacks new-school twists on the genre with clever level design and quirky combat that includes moves like the magician’s confetti bomb. But the fun really amps up once you get the ability to mix-and-match attacks between forms, which unlocks more than a hundred combos to help dispatch foes.</p><p>If the game’s gorgeous 2D sprites weren’t enough to catch your attention, <em>Nobody Saves the World</em> also features a soundtrack from composer Jim Guthrie, whose music has been featured in titles such as <em>Superbother: Sword &amp; Sworcery</em>, <em>Indie Game: The Movie</em>, and others.</p><p><em>Nobody Saves the World</em> is available now on Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X and PC (Steam) for $25, or via subscription as part of Xbox Games Pass on Xbox consoles, Windows PCs, and Xbox Cloud streaming.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nobody-saves-the-world-out-now-on-xbox-and-pc-171042189.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e49668b0-15e0-4c5c-888b-cbeb9cd84818</guid><dc:creator>Sam Rutherford</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 17:10:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642614266</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T17:44:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Sam Rutherford]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/500d38a0-7949-11ec-b7c1-7c9cf8ec1c2e" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/500d38a0-7949-11ec-b7c1-7c9cf8ec1c2e" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Drinkbox Studios]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A screenshot from hack-and-slash RPG Nobody Saves the World.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nobody saves the world combat]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's WeWork drama 'WeCrashed' premieres March 18th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple is nearly ready to release its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-plus-wecrashed-series-190134468.html">tale of WeWork&#39;s tragic fall</a>.

The eight-episode drama stars Jared Leto as former WeWork CEO Adam Neumann, who wielded hype to earn a $47 billion valuation only to lose most of it (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-11-wework-ceo-john-legere-t-mobile-report.html">and his job</a>) when the IPO process revealed ugly financials and leadership. Anne Hathaway plays Adam&#39;s wife Rebekah, who served as an executive (including the head of WeGrow) and whose relationship with Adam was &quot;at the center of it all,&quot; according to Apple.</p><p>The trailer sets expectations quickly. The Neumanns portrayed by Leto and Hathaway are full of overly grand visions, portraying WeWork as nothing less than the future, a &quot;movement&quot; aiming to &quot;elevate the world&#39;s consciousness.&quot; The clip also highlights the cult-like devotion to the company and its notoriously summer camp-like retreats. It&#39;s not certain how well the performances will hold up across a whole series, but Apple at least seems to understand how WeWork&#39;s reality was never going to match the buzz.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This isn&#39;t the first streaming take on WeWork&#39;s rise and sudden decline. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hulu-wework-documentary-adam-neumann-170036642.html">Hulu&#39;s 2021 documentary</a> was an imperfect but prominent take on the Neumann couple. Apple&#39;s effort clearly has star power, however, and the behind-the-camera talent has experience with well-received titles like <em>Little America</em> and <em>This is Us</em>.

Payne &amp; Patrick McKay <a href="https://press.amazonstudios.com/us/en/press-release/prime-videos-most-anticipated-new-series-of-2022-r">said in a statement</a>. “<em>The Rings of Power </em>unites all the major stories of Middle-earth’s Second Age: the forging of the rings, the rise of the Dark Lord Sauron, the epic tale of Númenor and the Last Alliance of Elves and Men. Until now, audiences have only seen onscreen the story of the One Ring — but before there was one, there were many... and we’re excited to share the epic story of them all.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The video shows what looks like a few valleys with wispy fog before we see what&#39;s actually going on. Molten metal fills in the grooves before it&#39;s cooled with water. The camera then zooms out to reveal the show&#39;s name. The clip was shot <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZEpWvQFXqQ">using practical effects</a> instead of CGI.</p><p>The teaser doesn&#39;t feature any characters or provide plot details.

According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/funds/undersea-cable-fault-could-cut-off-tonga-rest-world-weeks-2022-01-18/"><em>Reuters</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22891031/tonga-volcano-eruption-broke-undersea-internet-cable-repair"><em>The Verge</em></a>, the Tonga government has <a href="https://twitter.com/ConsulateKoT/status/1483384039826464768">warned</a> internet access is &quot;down&quot; following damage to the lone undersea fiber optic cable keeping the archipelago online. While the country didn&#39;t provide an initial estimate, the Southern Cross Cable Network&#39;s Craige Sloots told <em>Reuters</em> it might take as long as two weeks to repair the cable &quot;all things going well.&quot;</p><p>It will take the repair ship up to nine days to travel from Papua New Guinea to Tonga, according to Sloots. The timing for the repair will also hinge on safety clearance and any lingering activity from the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha&#39;apai volcano. The 514-mile cable is secured through a Fiji relay.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Tonga has been somewhat prepared for incidents like this. It struck a 15-year agreement for satellite internet access with Kacific in 2019 after damage to the underwater cable. However, <em>ZDNet</em><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/kacific-waiting-for-tongan-contract-activation-to-supply-satellite-services-post-eruption/">learned</a> a contract dispute with Kacific kept that access from being activated. Officials said the country&#39;s two telecoms were &quot;working on satellite options&quot; to restore service, but didn&#39;t provide timelines.</p><p>The outage underscores the vulnerability of internet access for island nations and other remote communities. While many countries connect to the rest of the world <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-subsea-cable-grace-hopper-london-spain-132503991.html">through undersea cabling</a>, these more distant areas are frequently dependent on either a very limited cable network or expensive satellite service that can degrade in bad weather. Until these places have more reliable cables or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-100000-starlink-satellite-internet-terminals-051812274.html">lower-cost satellite data</a>, they can&#39;t depend on the internet for vital services to the degree other regions can.</p><div id="bb7d3dd4a7ec4f8e9b48dc3bf5faa6be"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">FIRST OFFICIAL UPDATE FOLLOWING THE VOLCANIC ERUPTION FROM THE GOVERNMENT OF TONGA 🇹🇴 <a href="https://t.co/fX3KPlKx2E">pic.twitter.com/fX3KPlKx2E</a></p>— Consulate of the Kingdom of Tonga (@ConsulateKoT) <a href="https://twitter.com/ConsulateKoT/status/1483384039826464768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 18, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tonga-internet-cut-off-volcano-eruption-152450410.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cc96568e-72b7-4275-aca1-6256bc4c2dcf</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 15:24:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642614384</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T17:46:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/55823660-7934-11ec-bb1f-a5bf10ec15d3" width="8711" height="5739" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/55823660-7934-11ec-bb1f-a5bf10ec15d3" width="10365" height="6829" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Maxar via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[HUNGA TONGA-HUNGA HA'APAI, TONGA – DECEMBER 24, 2021: In this image 2. of a series created on January 19, 2022, Maxar overview satellite imagery shows the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano on December 24, 2021, before the eruption on January 14th , 2022 in Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai Islands, Tonga.
