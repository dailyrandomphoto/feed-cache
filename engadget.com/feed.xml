One UI 4 now allows a more customized experience with new color palettes and widgets, along with a wider range of emoji features, GIFs and stickers.

Following the lead of Android 12, Samsung is introducing a Privacy Dashboard that brings all settings and controls into one place. For example, it will show when an app is attempting to access your camera, microphone or other sensor, and why it needed that data.</p><p>Other features include access to Samsung&#39;s extended ecosystem of devices and third-party apps. That will ensure a &quot;seamless experience&quot; when using non-Samsung apps like Google Duo, the company said. It&#39;s also promising a uniform look across devices like the Galaxy Fold, Galaxy Watch and Galaxy Tab.</p><p>Since the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-07-samsung-one-ui-clean-android.html">release</a> of One UI, Samsung has been trying to get the latest versions of Android onto its high-end smartphones as quickly as possible. It&#39;s fair to say it&#39;s done that here, as Google released Android 12<a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-android-12-pixel-3-rollout-170031989.html"> less than a month ago</a> onto its Pixel 3 devices. One UI 4 is available starting today for Galaxy S21 device, &quot;and will soon arrive to previous Galaxy S and Note series as well as Galaxy A series, foldables and tablets,&quot; the company said.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-phones-get-update-to-one-ui-4-110031121.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4674f57b-dd58-4e44-af91-0f3dfb879d6e</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 15 Nov 2021 11:00:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636970551</ingested><modified>2021-11-15T10:02:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/b35d12b0-45f8-11ec-8b5e-c4da98a43f87" width="2400" height="1350" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/b35d12b0-45f8-11ec-8b5e-c4da98a43f87" width="2400" height="1350" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung's Galaxy S21 series updated to One UI 4 with new Android 12 features]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung's Galaxy S21 series updated to One UI 4 with new Android 12 features]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple offers $30 million to settle off-the-clock bag search controversy]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year, California&#39;s supreme court <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-14-apple-pay-employees-bag-searches-lost-time.html">ruled</a> that Apple broke the law by failing to pay employees while they waited for mandatory bag and iPhone searches.

There, the judges ruled that Apple workers were &quot;clearly under Apple&#39;s control while awaiting, and during, the exit searches.&quot; The court dismissed Apple&#39;s argument that bringing a bag to work was an employee convenience, particularly that Apple felt employees didn&#39;t necessarily need to bring their iPhones to work.</p><p>&quot;Its characterization of the iPhone as unnecessary for its own employees is directly at odds with its description of the iPhone as an &#39;integrated and integral&#39; part of the lives of everyone else,&quot; the judges wrote. In that statement, the court referenced a 2017 Tim Cook interview where he stated that the iPhone was &quot;so so integrated and integral to our lives, you wouldn&#39;t think about leaving home without it.&quot;</p><p>The settlement is still subject to approval by the plaintiffs. Nearly 12,000 current and former Apple Store employees in California involved in the lawsuit stand to receive a maximum payment of around $1,200.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-offers-30-million-to-settle-off-the-clock-bag-search-controversy-084819770.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4d6224da-cdf2-408c-bd68-d1b7d51ac44d</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 15 Nov 2021 08:48:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636973123</ingested><modified>2021-11-15T10:45:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/64a77fe0-45ec-11ec-bedc-e42b71b71d5d" width="5550" height="3693" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/64a77fe0-45ec-11ec-bedc-e42b71b71d5d" width="5550" height="3693" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[ANGELA WEISS via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[People walk past an Apple retail store on July 13, 2021 in New York City. - Stock markets were slightly softer on news of the biggest jump in US inflation in more than two decades and disappointment in results from US investment banks.

IBM is crediting the breakthrough to a new design that puts the processor’s control components on multiple physical levels while the qubits are located on a single layer. It’s a design the company says allows for a significant increase in computing power.</p><p>One aspect of Eagle the company isn’t talking about at the moment is quantum volume. Cointed by IBM, it’s a metric that attempts to measure the performance of a quantum computer by taking a holistic view of its different parts. Not only does it take into account qubits, but also the way in which they interact with one another. The higher the quantum volume, the more capable a quantum computer is at tackling difficult problems.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/518f62b0-457e-11ec-833f-60f25d21d5d6" alt="IBM Eagle" data-uuid="0056fd19-e3cc-369d-b225-6be695458c42"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">IBM</div></figure><p>“Our first 127-qubit Eagle processor is available as an exploratory system on the IBM Cloud to select members of the IBM Quantum Network,” Jerry Chow, the director of IBM’s Quantum Hardware System Development unit, told Engadget. “Exploratory systems are early access to our latest technologies and so we do not guarantee uptime or a particular level of repeatable performance, as measured by quantum volume.”</p><p>Without knowing the quantum volume of the Eagle processor, it’s hard to say exactly how it compares to what&#39;s out there already. Last October, Honeywell claimed its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/honeywell-system-model-h1-quantum-computer-128-quantum-volume-141054348.html">System Model H1</a> had a quantum volume of 128 with just 10 connected qubits. For reference, earlier in the year IBM <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2020-08-20-IBM-Delivers-Its-Highest-Quantum-Volume-to-Date-Expanding-the-Computational-Power-of-its-IBM-Cloud-Accessible-Quantum-Computers">announced a 27 qubit system</a> with a then industry-leading quantum volume of 64. Clearly, the company’s new processor is powerful, but qubits don’t tell the whole story here.</p><p>What’s also notable about Eagle is that IBM is not claiming quantum supremacy. According to the company, it’s a step toward that milestone, but the processor is not yet at the point where it can solve problems that classical computers cannot. In 2019, Google sparked controversy when it (briefly) claimed it had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-23-google-quantum-supremacy.html">achieved the feat</a> with its Sycamore system. At the time, IBM called the company’s claims “indefensible” based on the fact Google built the computer to solve one specific equation.</p><p>IBM will make Eagle available to select members of its <a href="https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/ibm-q-network/">Quantum Network</a> starting next month.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ibm-eagle-processor-050133991.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cec5369b-79f5-47e6-af6b-4eef3c7e5daf</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 15 Nov 2021 05:01:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636920537</ingested><modified>2021-11-14T20:09:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3cf83ca0-457e-11ec-a7ff-0e79d67ad107" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3cf83ca0-457e-11ec-a7ff-0e79d67ad107" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[IBM]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[IBM Quantum]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[IBM Quantum]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tesla is deploying Starlink satellite internet dishes at Superchargers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Don&#39;t despair if you want to stream a show at a Tesla Supercharger but aren&#39;t paying for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-24-tesla-premium-connectivity-charges.html">Premium Connectivity</a> — you might have an official alternative. <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/11/14/tesla-starts-deploying-starlink-satellite-internet-systems-supercharger-stations/">According</a> to <em>Electrek</em>, Tesla EV owners have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/qte6h1/starlink_dish_dishy_mcflatface_spotted_at/">spotted</a> Starlink satellite internet dishes at Supercharger stations.

The Fire TV Cube has also reached an all-time low <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Amazon Fire TV Cube" href="https://amzn.to/3qBxZCN">of $80</a> (normally $120) if you&#39;d prefer a hybrid smart speaker and media hub.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3qFEPqX" id="df26c08734d24f71beac5000edc680c9" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max">Buy Fire TV Stick 4K Max on Amazon - $35</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3qBxZCN" id="e8c6fcc1248848f3a81d9a7441363fd7" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Amazon Fire TV Cube">Buy Fire TV Cube on Amazon - $80</a><p>The regular Fire TV Stick 4K is also on sale <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K" href="https://amzn.to/3HhrsmV">for $25</a> (typically $50) if price is more important, or if you don&#39;t think you&#39;ll need the extras its Max counterpart offers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Fire TV Stick 4K Max may look much like its regular counterpart on the outside, but it&#39;s about 40 percent faster. That promises faster load times, a smoother interface, better gaming and headroom for new features like a live picture-in-picture view of your video doorbell. WiFi 6 support also delivers a more reliable connection for your 4K streams if you have a similarly modern router. While those aren&#39;t must-haves, the price gap is small enough ($10 as of this writing) to make them worth the money.</p><p>Fire TV&#39;s usual caveats apply regardless of the model you&#39;re buying.  You&#39;ll have access to a wide range of apps and services, but there&#39;s no doubt Amazon favors its own. Likewise, these Alexa-centric devices won&#39;t be great fits if your smart home revolves around Apple HomeKit or Google Assistant. For most anyone else, though, these will be solid choices for living room streaming.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-sale-152737451.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7ab45a85-0972-4512-9715-dbbf4581b4ae</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 14 Nov 2021 15:27:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636903660</ingested><modified>2021-11-14T15:27:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/af68ead0-4558-11ec-9bf5-22bfe67234c7" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/af68ead0-4558-11ec-9bf5-22bfe67234c7" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[FBI email servers were hacked to target a security researcher]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The FBI appears to have been used as a pawn in a fight between hackers and security researchers. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-system-hacked-to-email-urgent-warning-about-fake-cyberattacks/">According</a> to <em>Bleeping Computer</em>, the FBI has confirmed intruders compromised its email servers early today (November 13th) to send fake messages claiming recipients had fallen prone to data breaches. The emails tried to pin the non-existent attacks on Vinny Troia, the leader of dark web security firms NightLion and Shadowbyte.</p><p>The non-profit intelligence organization Spamhaus quickly <a href="https://twitter.com/spamhaus/status/1459451401269043201">shed light</a> on the bogus messages. The attackers used legitimate FBI systems to conduct the attack, using email addresses scraped from a database for the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN), among other sources.  Over 100,000 addresses received the fake emails in at least two waves.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The FBI described the hack as an &quot;ongoing situation&quot; and didn&#39;t initially have more details to share. It asked email recipients to report messages like these to the bureau&#39;s <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/">Internet Crime Complaint Center</a> or the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/">Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency</a>. Troia told <em>Bleeping Computer</em> he believed the perpetrators might be linked to &quot;Pompomourin,&quot; a persona that has attacked the researcher in the past.</p><p>Feuds between hackers and the security community aren&#39;t new. In March, attackers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-email-server-exploited-30000-us-organizations-043324374.html">exploiting Microsoft Exchange servers</a> tried to implicate security journalist Brian Krebs using a rogue domain. However, it&#39;s rare that they use real domains from a government agency like the FBI as part of their campaign. While that may be more effective than usual (the FBI was swamped with calls from anxious IT administrators), it might also prompt a particularly swift response — law enforcement won&#39;t take kindly to being a victim.</p><div id="9ce86245383e4ba49efd65bca327141d"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">These fake warning emails are apparently being sent to addresses scraped from ARIN database.

There are some areas where the new arrangement (billed by the UN as the Glasgow Climate Pact) may offer significant progress, but there are also concerns it doesn&#39;t hold countries to stricter standards — including a move away from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-30-clean-coal-myth-trump-carbon-capture-energy-no.html">coal energy</a>.</p><p>In negotiations that extended roughly a day past the original November 12th deadline, representatives from China and India successfully changed language in the COP26 agreement that asked countries to &quot;phase-down&quot; unabated coal use rather than &quot;phase-out.&quot; While COP26 president Alok Sharma and numerous countries&#39; delegates wanted the tougher language, Sharma said it was &quot;vital&quot; to protect the deal. However, there are worries this will give coal-dependent countries like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-26-china-raises-renewable-energy-target-to-reduce-coal.html">China</a> and India an excuse to avoid firmer commitments to emissions reduction.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Previous critics blasted wealthier nations for failing to act on a promise of giving poorer countries $100 billion per year until 2023 to help them deal with climate change. The Glasgow deal only committed to making a new plan in the next three years.</p><p>The final pact does include some notable measures. It asks countries &quot;revisit and strengthen&quot; their climate change plans before the end of 2022, as <em>New Scientist</em><a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2297452-cop26-world-agrees-to-phase-out-fossil-fuel-subsidies-and-reduce-coal/">noted</a>. Similarly, there&#39;s a strategy to address long-running disputes over global carbon credit markets. Numerous countries promised to reduce methane emissions and stop deforestation, and the agreement called for reduced subsidies on fossil fuels. Separately, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-china-climate-change-pledge-cop-26-194435337.html">US and China reached a deal</a> to limit climate change in the 2020s, including a new recognition from China that methane had a significant impact on rising temperatures.</p><p>Nonetheless, there are fears the COP26 arrangement is generally too soft. It doesn&#39;t set many binding targets. The final language only &quot;requests&quot; that countries rethink their plans, for instance. The pact might prompt some countries to step up their environmental initiatives, but others may face relatively few consequences if they fall short.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/cop26-climate-change-glasgow-pact-212507731.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2c9886c6-7440-45ec-80e6-e3572b3d452d</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 13 Nov 2021 21:25:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636838709</ingested><modified>2021-11-13T21:25:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Climate Change]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/2c98d340-44c2-11ec-b9b3-63de6df0f242" width="3162" height="2077" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/2c98d340-44c2-11ec-b9b3-63de6df0f242" width="3162" height="2077" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Yves Herman / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[COP26 President Alok Sharma holds a gavel as he speaks at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland, Britain November 13, 2021.

But one technology Roddenberry called for in the 1960s has yet to make it off the screen: teleportation. It&#39;s not only that &quot;we just don&#39;t have enough power,&quot; as Scotty would say, we also lack the fundamental knowledge base to make it a reality. For now, at least. In their latest book, <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/frequently-asked-questions-about-the-universe/9780593189313"><em>Frequently Asked Questions about the Universe</em></a>, Jorge Cham and Daniel Whiteson delve into this and a host of other quandaries facing humanity — from whether there&#39;s an afterlife, why aliens haven&#39;t made contact with us yet, or if our observable existence is actually a computer simulation.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ec48b220-3e6c-11ec-b3df-607b033f0ef1" alt="frequently asked questions about the universe" data-uuid="4aa49078-dd17-32ba-bb40-cea6e0545ca9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Penguin</div></figure><p><em>Excerpted from</em> Frequently Asked Questions about the Universe <em>by Jorge Cham and Daniel Whiteson.

No part of this excerpt may be reproduced or reprinted without permission in writing from the publisher.</em></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><hr><p>If your dream of teleportation is to be here in one moment, and then be in a totally different place the next moment, then we are sad to tell you right off the bat that this is impossible. Unfortunately, physics has some pretty hard rules about anything happening instantaneously. Anything that happens (an effect) has to have a cause, which in turn requires the transmission of information. Think about it: in order for two things to be causally related to each other (like you disappearing here and you appearing somewhere else), they have to somehow talk to each other. And in this universe, everything, including information, has a speed limit.</p><p>Information has to travel through space just like everything else, and the fastest anything can travel in this universe is the speed of light. Really, the speed of light should have been called the “speed of information” or “the universe’s speed limit.” It’s baked into relativity and the very idea of cause and effect, which are at the heart of physics.</p><p>Even gravity can’t move faster than light. The Earth doesn’t feel gravity from where the Sun is right now; it feels gravity from where the Sun was eight minutes ago. That’s how long it takes information to travel the ninety-three million miles between here and there. If the Sun disappeared (teleporting off for its own vacation), the Earth would continue in its normal orbit for eight minutes before realizing that the Sun was gone.</p><p>So the idea that you can disappear in one place and reappear in another place instantly is pretty much out of the question. Something has to happen in between, and that something can’t move faster than light.</p><p>Fortunately, most of us aren’t such sticklers when it comes to the definition of “teleportation.” Most of us will take “almost instantly” or “in the blink of an eye” or even “as fast as the laws of physics will allow” for our teleportation needs. If that’s the case, then there are two options for making a teleportation machine work:</p><p>1. Your teleportation machine could transmit you to your destination at the speed of light.</p><p>2. Your teleportation machine could somehow shorten the distance between where you are and where you want to go.</p><p>Option #2 is what you might call the “portal” type of teleportation. In movies, it would be the kind of teleportation that opens up a doorway, usually through a wormhole or some kind of extradimensional subspace, that you step through to find yourself somewhere else. Wormholes are theoretical tunnels that connect points in space that are far away, and physicists have definitely proposed the existence of multiple dimensions beyond the three we are familiar with.</p><p>Sadly, both of these concepts are still very much theoretical. We haven’t actually seen a wormhole, nor do we have any idea how to open one or control where it leads. And extra dimensions aren’t really something you can move into. They only represent extra ways in which your particles might be able to wiggle.</p><p>Much more interesting to talk about is Option #1, which, as it turns out, might actually be something we can do in the near future.</p><h2>Getting There at Light Speed</h2><p>If we can’t appear in other places instantly, or take shortcuts through space, can we at least get there as fast as possible? The top speed of the universe, three hundred million meters per second, is plenty fast to cut your commute down to a fraction of a second and make trips to the stars take years instead of decades or millennia. Speed-of-light teleportation would still be awesome.</p><p>To do that, you might imagine a machine that somehow takes your body and then pushes it at the speed of light to your destination. Unfortunately, there’s a big problem with this idea, and it’s that you’re too heavy. The truth is that you’re too massive to ever travel at the speed of light. First, it would take an enormous amount of time and energy just to accelerate all the particles in your body (whether assembled or broken up somehow) to speeds that are close to the speed of light. And second, you would never get to the speed of light. It doesn’t matter how much you’ve been dieting or working on your CrossFit; nothing that has any mass can ever travel at the speed of light.</p><p>Particles like electrons and quarks, the building blocks of your atoms, have mass. That means that it takes energy to get them moving, a lot of energy to get them moving fast, and infinite energy to reach the speed of light. They can travel at very high speeds, but they can never achieve light speed.</p><p>That means that you, and the molecules and particles that make up who you are right now, would never actually be able to teleport. Not instantaneously, and not at the speed of light. Transporting your body somewhere that quickly is never going to happen. It’s just not possible to move all the particles in your body fast enough.</p><p>But does that mean teleportation is impossible? Not quite!</p><p>There is one way it can still happen, and that’s if we relax what “you” means. What if we didn’t transport you, your molecules or your particles? What if we just transmitted the idea of you?</p><h2>You Are Information</h2><p>One possible way to achieve speed-of-light teleportation is to scan you and send you as a beam of photons. Photons don’t have any mass, which means they can go as fast as the universe will allow. In fact, photons can only travel at the speed of light (there’s no such thing as a slow-moving photon).*</p><p>Here’s a basic recipe for speed-of-light teleportation:</p><p>Step #1: Scan your body and record where all your molecules and particles are.</p><p>Step #2: Transmit this information to your destination via a beam of photons.</p><p>Step #3: Receive this information and rebuild your body using new particles.</p><p>Is this possible? Humans have made incredible progress in both scanning and 3D printing technologies. These days, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can scan your body down to a resolution of 0.1 millimeters, which is about the size of a brain cell. And scientists have used 3D printers to print increasingly more complicated clusters of living cells (known as “organoids”) for testing cancer drugs. We’ve even made machines (using scanning tunneling microscopes) that can grab and move individual atoms. So it’s not hard to imagine that one day we might be able to scan and then print whole bodies.</p><p>The real limitation, though, might not be technological but philosophical. After all, if someone made a copy of you, would it actually be you?</p><p>Remember, there’s nothing particularly special about the particles that make up your body right now. All particles of a given type are the same. Every electron is perfectly identical to every other electron, and the same is true for quarks. Particles don’t come out of the universe factory with personalities or any sort of distinguishing features. The only difference between any two electrons or any two quarks is where each of them is and what other particles they’re hanging out with.*</p><p>But how much would a copy of you still be you? Well, it depends on two things. The first is the resolution of the technology that scans and prints you. Can it read and print your cells? Your molecules? Your atoms, or even your individual particles?</p><p>The even bigger question is how much your “you-ness” depends on the tiny details. What level of detail does it take for the copy to still be considered you? It turns out that this is an open question, and the answer might depend on how quantum your sense of self is.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-frequently-asked-questions-about-the-universe-jorge-cham-daniel-whiteson-penguin-163100834.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c4fc3d2f-70c3-4663-9cb1-2192bcab8dbc</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 13 Nov 2021 16:31:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636478955</ingested><modified>2021-11-09T17:29:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Physics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9616eb70-3e6b-11ec-bda9-a7102c9653fb" width="2200" height="1467" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9616eb70-3e6b-11ec-bda9-a7102c9653fb" width="2200" height="1467" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Hitting the Books: Why we can&#39;t &#39;beam ourselves up&#39; Star Trek-style]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[White House reportedly discouraged Intel from boosting chip production in China]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>President Biden&#39;s security and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-budget-proposal-domestic-chip-manufacturing-180310697.html">domestic production efforts</a> may have a pronounced effect on Intel&#39;s plans. <em>Bloomberg</em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-13/white-house-spurns-intel-plan-to-boost-chip-production-in-china?sref=10lNAhZ9">sources</a> claim the White House &quot;strongly discouraged&quot; Intel from ramping up chip production in China to help address chip shortages. The improved capacity could have been available before the end of 2022, but the Biden administration was reportedly worried about security issues.</p><p>The semiconductor firm didn&#39;t completely rule out future Chinese production increases, according to the tipsters. However, Intel is believed to have &quot;no plans&quot; at present.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Intel didn&#39;t directly acknowledge the government objection in a statement, but welcomed &quot;other solutions&quot; to help meet chip demand. The company had looked at a &quot;number of approaches&quot; in tandem with the US, including new wafer manufacturing in the US and Europe.</p><p>An approach like this wouldn&#39;t be surprising, if accurate. Biden has continued a wary stance toward Chinese technology, going so far as to sign a law <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-signs-law-blocking-huawei-and-zte-from-fcc-licenses-081513515.html">barring Huawei and ZTE</a> from receiving FCC network licenses. While the sources didn&#39;t elaborate on the security issues with Intel, company chief Pat Gelsinger previously said a heavy dependence on Asian manufacturing represented a supply chain threat. There have also been historical concerns companies were improperly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-30-amd-denies-improperly-sharing-cpu-tech-with-china.html">sharing sensitive technology</a> with China.</p><p>Even if security weren&#39;t an issue, economic development might be a factor. Biden has pushed for more manufacturing in the US to address chip shortages, and Intel&#39;s reported Chinese expansion would have contradicted that policy. It also wouldn&#39;t have helped attempts to counter China&#39;s growth as an economic superpower.</p><p>Whatever the reasoning, a change of heart like this also risks prolonging chip shortages. While Intel is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-foundry-7nm-plan-analysis-141532580.html">building US plants</a> and asking for external manufacturing help, those efforts will take time and might not cover every shortfall. Intel may have to accept a near-term blow to production to honor the White House&#39;s goals, especially if it wants any factory-oriented funds from the stalled <a href="https://www.engadget.com/semiconductors-in-america-coalition-134524022.html">CHIPS Act</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/biden-white-house-discouraged-intel-chip-factory-161435175.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d5ae8f89-dbe3-4727-90f5-0d732d8ae2f5</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 13 Nov 2021 16:14:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636820077</ingested><modified>2021-11-13T16:14:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3d318e40-4490-11ec-bfcb-93b2b319f8a3" width="5571" height="3718" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3d318e40-4490-11ec-bfcb-93b2b319f8a3" width="5571" height="3718" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Aly Song / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Visitors are seen at the Intel booth during the China Digital Entertainment Expo and Conference, also known as ChinaJoy, in Shanghai, China July 30, 2021.

Series developer DICE told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22778261/battlefield-2042-voice-chat-release"><em><ins>Polygon</ins></em></a> the feature won’t be available until sometime after launch. The studio didn’t provide a reason for the decision. Whatever the case, the absence of voice chat will likely be keenly felt by Battlefield fans, especially on PC, Xbox Series X and S, and PlayStation 5 where matches will include as many as 128 players.</p><p>For what it’s worth, you can still use Discord or the party chat feature on your console to communicate with friends, but that won’t help you when you’re trying to play with strangers. In those instances, you’ll need to rely on the ping system, which is apparently on the cumbersome side. According to <em>Polygon</em>, you have to navigate through multiple menus before you can get to the right ping. All told, it sounds like Battlefield’s already chaotic matches will be a tad more unpredictable in the first few weeks that <em>2042</em> is available.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/battlefield-2042-voice-chat-200235461.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9ca877db-c511-433c-805d-f8cfd612bb48</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 12 Nov 2021 20:02:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636746765</ingested><modified>2021-11-12T19:52:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/8e1de660-ca0a-11eb-afa5-8accd287fe9e" width="3840" height="2160" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/8e1de660-ca0a-11eb-afa5-8accd287fe9e" width="3840" height="2160" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[DICE / EA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Battlefield 2042]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Battlefield 2042]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rockstar pulls the remastered GTA trilogy on PC]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The PC version of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/grand-theft-auto-trilogy-re-release-gta-3-vice-vity-san-andreas-rockstar-games-155826052.html"><em>Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy — The Definitive Edition</em></a> seems to have some serious issues at the minute.

We got <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/movies/obi-wan-kenobi/wPJYvt0aoozZ">our first glimpse</a> at the series during Disney+ Day, the streaming network&#39;s extended birthday celebration. While there&#39;s no actual footage from Obi-Wan available, a behind-the-scenes clip streaming through the app and concept art reveals some familiar and new territory for the franchise. Ewan McGregor confirms the show will start off with Obi-Wan trying to keep Luke Skywalker safe — as you&#39;d expect — but that&#39;s just the launching point for a whole series of new adventures, according to director Deborah Chow.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/2efa8220-43df-11ec-bbf5-5782a72d68a1" style="height:1000;width:1600;" alt="Obi-Wan Kenobi Disney+" data-uuid="658a9f33-9b48-3170-bc8c-c7ddf34cc0cd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Lucas Film/Disney</div></figure><p>Disney previously revealed that <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/578289/hayden-christensen-obi-wan-series/">Hayden Christensen would be returning</a> to play Darth Vader, and judging from the concept art (and some training footage), he&#39;ll definitely be ready to throw down once again. (The live-action footage in today&#39;s promo is just some clever editing from the previous <em>Star Wars </em>films.) Given the relatively tepid response to <em>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</em>, it makes sense for Disney to lean more on TV productions, like <em>The Mandalorian and The Book of Boba Fett,</em>, where it can explore new aspects of the franchise.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="61657cdf85274329a645d11a37fca40f"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lcYPrMk12zw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Perhaps not as hotly anticipated, there&#39;s also some footage from <em>Baymax!</em>, a show dedicated to the lovable healthcare robot from <em>Big Hero 6</em>. It&#39;s the second series for the franchise — following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Hero_6:_The_Series">the sequel show</a> that ran for three seasons — and from the looks of it, there&#39;ll be more focus on comedy than superhero antics. But really, it&#39;s not like we&#39;re lacking in super-powered action these days.</p><p><em>Obi-Wan Kenobi </em>and <em>Baymax! </em>will hit Disney+ sometime in 2022.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-obi-wan-kenobi-baymax-173811314.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d055ff4a-f004-43ed-b0e5-deadab3bf680</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 12 Nov 2021 17:38:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636739332</ingested><modified>2021-11-12T17:48:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/faba8050-43de-11ec-affb-449f7de22726" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/faba8050-43de-11ec-affb-449f7de22726" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Lucas Film/Disney]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Obi-Wan Kenobi Disney+]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Obi-Wan Kenobi Disney+]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
